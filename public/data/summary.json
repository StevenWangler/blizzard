  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Clearly indicates a quiet, dry, cold day: 0% precip, 0\" new snow, no active storm, no advisories. Summary explicitly calls the snow-day probability for this date \"effectively near 0%.\"\n- Historian (20% weight): Historical analogs for this pattern (cold, dry, treated roads, no storm, wind chills not near -15°F) show 0–2% closure rates. Strongly supports school being open.\n- Safety analyst (25% weight): Road and travel scores (9–9.5/10 for roads/lots, 8.5–9/10 for walking/driving) and a \"low\" risk level indicate normal winter operations with only routine caution.\n- News & community intel (20% weight): No posted closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts; no strong social/media signal calling for closure; messaging is about generic winter caution, not a specific hazard on this morning.\nAll four experts agree: conditions are typical winter cold, with no active storm, and do not meet local closure criteria. There are no meaningful conflicts.\n\n2. Where do they disagree?\nThere is only a minor nuance: the safety assessment flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in concept, but still rates actual road/lot conditions very highly and describes impacts as minimal. This is consistent with residual, spotty slickness—not systemic, closure-level ice. No expert suggests more than a very low closure chance.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow/ice end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Active light freezing rain/ice was on the prior day (Dec 15), not overnight into Dec 16.\n- For Dec 16 itself, the meteorological analysis shows no new precip overnight or in the morning; that effectively means the \"event\" ended well over 8–12 hours before the bus window.\n- By the 6:00–8:00 AM commute, road crews have had the entire overnight period to salt and treat any leftover slick spots.\n- Safety analyst still recommends only routine pre-treatment of bridges/known black-ice areas and notes minimal commute impact.\nEffective plow/treatment window before 7:40 AM: easily >8 hours, which in Kent County with robust operations is ample for a light event.\n\n4. Ice assessment (does ice change everything here?)\n- Ice is the one factor that can radically raise closure odds, but here:\n  • Meteorology: No freezing rain or new precip expected overnight; temperatures remain below freezing but dry.\n  • Safety: Ice-formation risk is flagged as a theoretical concern due to cold temps and prior light freezing rain, but actual scores and narrative imply isolated slick patches only.\n  • History: Similar setups (light prior icing, then dry/cold next morning) almost never lead to closures; main/bus routes are typically in good shape.\n  • News intel: No widespread crash clusters, no power issues, no special local advisories for hazardous ice on the specific morning.\nConclusion: Some residual or refreeze patches are possible, but not at a scale or severity that historically drives closures in this district.\n\n5. Neighboring district behavior\n- News intel explicitly confirms: no closures/delays posted for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD for this date.\n- With 0 neighboring closures, there is no \"domino\" push toward closing. Per your rule, the +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring districts being closed does not apply.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nKey ways this 2% estimate could be off:\n- Hidden ice problem: If residual freezing rain from Dec 15 produced more extensive black ice than reported, and early-morning crash reports or bus test runs find hills and backroads unsafe, the district could call a late closure or delay even without new precip.\n- Unforecast issue: A last-minute, localized freezing drizzle or dense fog/black ice event that the models miss.\n- Non-weather factors: A local infrastructure failure (e.g., water main break at a key campus, heating failures) could close schools for reasons unrelated to the forecast—outside the scope of a weather-based probability.\nHistorically and from current intel, these are low-probability edge cases.\n\n7. Weighting and final probability\nUsing the specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Near-0% closure suggested → contributes ~1% after rounding for residual uncertainty.\n- Safety (25%): \"Low\" risk, minimal commute impact, high condition scores → suggests ~1–3% closure risk; we use ~2%.\n- History (20%): 0–2% closure in analogs → ~1–2%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures in Rockford or neighbors, no strong closure chatter → supports the low historical/forecast rate (~1–2%).\nAll four converge strongly in the 0–3% band. Michigan thresholds say: with effectively 0\" new snow and no active ice storm, baseline closure odds are ~5–15% in generic guidance—but that range assumes active nuisance weather. Here there is *no* active event, so actual odds should be at the bottom tail of that, consistent with the expert data and local tolerance.\nTo minimize Brier score and reflect the strong consensus, I set the probability at 2%, firmly outside the 40–60% \"uncertain\" band and in line with the historical 0–2% closure rate for this pattern.\n\nConclusion: Conditions match a standard cold, breezy Michigan school day with dry roads and routine winter caution. A snow day or delay for Rockford Public Schools on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025 is very unlikely.",
