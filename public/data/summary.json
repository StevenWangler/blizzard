  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts converge on (a) minor snow totals, (b) a narrow pre-dawn hazard window, and (c) the main operational risk being slick spots (bridges/untreated roads) rather than deep snow. They also agree a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The only major conflict was wind chill (Weather.com showed <= -20°F earlier). Web verifier resolved this: official NWS point forecast for Rockford MI indicates wind chills around ~-8°F overnight and ~-2°F Tuesday (commute window not near -20°F). So the automatic cold-closure trigger is NOT supported.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow/mix ends ~6:30; that’s essentially 0–1 hour before buses. Highways/arterials get continuous cycles, but neighborhood streets and rural bus-route connectors often won’t be “good” until after a daylight pass (~8:30–10:30). That timing supports delay risk but not a strong full-closure signal.\n4) Ice: Present as a risk, but likely *trace-to-spotty* (meteorologist notes extremely small QPF during freezing-rain hours). Enough for isolated slickness; not a widespread glaze event.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Tue closures/delays for Rockford or key neighbors; closings pages show minimal activity → no domino boost.\n6) Power: Kent County outages extremely low (~12 customers). No evidence of a broader outage event → no power-based bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS confirms not <= -20°F for Rockford → no near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make me wrong: If freezing drizzle/freezing rain is more efficient than forecast and creates widespread black ice (especially around 5:30–7:00 AM) OR if an early-morning crash cluster/road incident pattern emerges OR a localized power/heat outage affects multiple buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) all point to low closure odds because totals are small and improvements occur after daybreak; Safety/Infrastructure highlight commute timing and secondary-road traction as the main issue. News (15%) provides no confirmed closure momentum. Infrastructure (10%) suggests arterials OK but neighborhoods/rural still slick. Power (10%) low outages. Web verifier (5%) removes the -20°F trigger. Net result: a closure is possible but not likely; I land on ~20% for a full snow day closure (with higher probability for a 2-hour delay than for a closure).",
