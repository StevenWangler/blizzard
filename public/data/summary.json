    "No accumulating snow expected (0\") and no wintry precip during the 6–8 AM bus window; precip type is rain later in the day",
    "Temperatures during bus hours are forecast to be above freezing (mid-30s °F) with feels-like near ~30 °F; web verification found no extreme-cold threshold signal",
    "Road/infrastructure posture is normal with roads expected clear; any hazard is mainly isolated bridge-deck/shaded-spot slickness + potential fog near/after start time",
    "No confirmed Rockford announcement and no confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays found (domino-effect pressure absent)",
    "Power-grid risk appears low systemwide (scattered outages), with no evidence of a Rockford-specific outage cluster impacting school facilities (though map drill-down is a data gap)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts broadly agree this is not a Michigan-style snow day setup: meteorology shows above-freezing temps in the morning with no snow and no morning precip; the web verifier corroborates feels-like values around ~29–30°F with no extreme wind chill. History supports that thaw/overcast/fog mornings with rain later rarely produce full closures in Rockford/Kent County, and are more likely to be normal operations (at most a minor delay) unless there is confirmed freezing rain or widespread icing—neither is present in the provided forecast. The main conflict was the FOX17/Kent County Road Commission ‘anticipated icy roads’ messaging versus the hourly forecast; after clarifying, safety/infrastructure interpret the realistic mechanism as isolated microclimate refreeze (bridge decks, shaded rural segments) and visibility reduction from fog, not widespread glaze. News intelligence did not find Rockford or neighboring districts announcing closures/delays, removing the key domino-effect driver. Power outages are scattered at the system level and weather is not conducive to new outage growth; absent evidence of a Rockford-specific outage pocket affecting school buildings, power does not materially raise the closure odds. Net: closure is unlikely; recommend OPEN with monitoring and early-morning spot-salt/visibility messaging. Probability set slightly above the 4–6% meteorology/news baseline to account for the non-zero chance of localized black ice or an unexpected freezing-drizzle micro-event prompting a conservative call.",
