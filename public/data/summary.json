    "Main operational hazard is freezing fog/low stratus with reduced visibility (~4:00–7:30 AM) and a patchy black-ice risk on bridges/untreated rural spots—more consistent with caution or (if school were in session) a minor delay, not a full closure.",
    "Infrastructure and power signals do not indicate a forcing function: roads generally clear/spot-treat mode; outages minimal and stable (no storm-driven outage risk)."
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "There is a key “conflict” only in framing, not in the underlying facts: meteorology/safety/history analyze a typical instructional day and conclude a low closure probability due to no snow/precip and only a freezing-fog/patchy-ice hazard. News intelligence, however, confirms Rockford Public Schools is definitively closed on 2026-02-16 for a scheduled Mid-Winter Break (calendar + news post + homepage reminder + superintendent update). Because there is no instructional day to cancel, the probability of a *weather-driven snow day closure decision* is effectively 0% with very high confidence. If you need the counterfactual (if school were in session), the same inputs support “open with monitoring,” with the only realistic operational adjustment being slower bus routes or, in a worst localized-dense-fog case, a short delay—not a full closure.",
