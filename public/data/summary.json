    "Low snowfall total signal (~1.4\") is typically manageable for West Michigan districts",
    "Ice risk is the main wildcard: light freezing rain/glaze window ~3–4 AM with mid-teen temps (won’t melt)",
    "Worst travel window overlaps bus/commute: ~3:00–8:30 AM, with a moderate snow burst near ~8 AM and ~1 mile visibility",
    "Plow timing is unfavorable: precip is ongoing at/after start time; secondaries likely only partially improved by 7:40 AM",
    "News/closure “domino” signal is currently weak: no confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays found in latest check; Rockford also has no post yet",
    "Advisory messaging for Kent County suggests broader concern, but the local modeled totals do not strongly support 2–5\" in Rockford without unexpected banding"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement across experts: All four align that (a) snow totals look modest (~1–2\"), (b) the morning window is the problem (timing + visibility), and (c) even a thin glaze 3–4 AM could disproportionately worsen roads at mid-teen temps.\n2) Disagreement/conflict: News intel initially implied “closures already announced,” but the latest targeted check did NOT confirm specific neighboring public-school closures/delays (and Rockford has no notice). That weakens the domino-effect boost. Also, external advisory messaging mentions 2–5\", while the meteorology dataset here supports ~1.4\" unless banding occurs.\n3) Plow timing math: Per safety analyst, precip is not ended by 7:40 AM. There’s ~4 hours of treatment opportunity on primaries (≈03:30–07:30) and only ~2.5 hours of meaningful improvement on secondaries (≈05:00–07:30) before the ~08:00 re-covering burst.\n4) Any ice? Yes—explicit light freezing rain 03:00–04:00; likely light glaze (trace–few hundredths LE) but high-impact at ~14–19°F.\n5) Neighboring districts: Not confirmed closed/delayed in latest check; therefore no +15–20% closure adjustment.\n6) What would make me wrong? (a) Freezing rain is more than a trace and becomes widespread “sheet ice,” (b) snow banding boosts totals toward 3–5\" by mid-morning, (c) a major nearby district announces closure overnight, triggering a domino effect, or (d) overnight treatment/crew availability is reduced and secondaries stay untreated.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Points toward ‘messy commute’ but not a deep-snow event; ice window + 8 AM burst elevates risk, but totals stay low.\n- Safety (25%): Moderate risk; pattern favors DELAY more than full closure unless glaze verifies worse than forecast.\n- History (20%): With only ~1–2\" total, closures are uncommon; however, glaze+timing events do produce cancellations sometimes. That lifts from a “routine 10–15%” snow-total baseline into the 20–35% band.\n- News Intel (20%): Advisory messaging supports elevated concern, but lack of confirmed neighboring closures and no Rockford post keeps probability from jumping.\n\nBottom line: Michigan thresholding says <4\" is usually 5–15%, but the ice risk and start-time snow burst justify moving above that into the high-20s. With no confirmed domino closures, a FULL snow day remains less likely than a DELAY.",
