  "decision_rationale": "All six expert inputs align on a low Tuesday-closure risk. Meteorology, safety, history, and infrastructure all indicate essentially no snowfall/precip during the 6–9 AM decision window, with only light accumulation later in the evening after school. Wind chills are cold but not in the dangerous-closure bands, and no credible source indicates ≤ -20°F wind chills for bus hours (the web verification was stale/mismatched by date, so we rely primarily on the date-consistent WeatherAPI feed). Safety’s ‘moderate’ ice risk is specifically from residual moisture/refreeze (isolated slick spots on bridges/overpasses, shaded areas, and neighborhood streets), not from new freezing precip—this typically leads to caution/route adjustments rather than a full closure in Michigan. News intelligence shows no emerging domino effect (no neighboring closures posted) and no official Rockford alert. Power grid conditions show no outage pattern that would force a closure. Net: Rockford is most likely OPEN on Tue 2/24, with monitoring focused on Tuesday night snow and the potential for a higher-risk Wednesday morning if snow lingers or if early route checks find widespread ‘polished’ ice.",
