    "Temps well above freezing during 6–8 AM bus window (low–mid 40s°F) with feels-like mid-30s → no cold-closure trigger",
    "No snow/ice accumulation expected for the morning commute; precipitation is rain tapering around ~7 AM",
    "Wind Advisory (gusts up to ~45 mph) is the main hazard: possible scattered tree debris and isolated outages, but typically not enough alone for district-wide closure",
    "Visibility risk appears to be patchy fog/low stratus (most likely ~1+ mile at bus time per meteorologist); near-zero visibility values look like an overstatement/artifact for 6–8 AM",
    "No confirmed local closure ‘domino effect’ signals; closings aggregators show none active, and community sentiment shows no buzz"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge that this is not a classic Michigan snow/ice morning: temperatures stay well above freezing through bus time and snowfall is 0. The web verifier corroborates that no credible source shows dangerous wind chills (nowhere near the ≤-20°F rule), and Weather.com aligns with the API on feels-like (~mid/upper 30s). The only plausible closure mechanisms are secondary impacts—(1) wind-driven widespread outages/debris before the ~5:30 AM decision window, or (2) truly dense fog at bus time. Follow-up clarifications reduce both concerns: the meteorologist expects patchy fog with minimum visibility around ~1 mile and improving after daybreak, and the safety analyst confirms ice risk is mainly late-day refreeze (not morning black ice). News intel shows no active closings and no neighboring-district closure wave (with one neighbor, Northview, already off for mid-winter break, so not a domino indicator). Power data suggests low statewide outages going into Friday, making a pre-dawn widespread outage scenario unlikely. Therefore the most defensible, Brier-optimized call is a low single-digit probability with a small tail-risk bump for wind/outage/debris surprises.",
