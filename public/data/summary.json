  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) AGREEMENTS ACROSS ALL FOUR EXPERTS\n- Timing: All agree that Rockford’s Friday, Jan 16, 6–9 AM commute window is cold, dry, and overcast with NO new snow falling. Any hazard is from leftover packed snow and refreeze/black ice, not fresh accumulation.\n- Onset of main snow: Meteorologist, safety analyst, and cross-check concur that meaningful accumulating snow begins around midday (~12 PM) and continues through afternoon/evening.\n- Type of precip: All-snow event for Rockford; no warm nose, no freezing rain, and no significant freezing drizzle signal during bus window or early afternoon.\n- Severity: Advisory-level system, not a warning/blizzard. Roughly 2\" of additional snow during the school day in Rockford, with regional 4–6\" totals more focused west of US‑131.\n- Operational impact: Morning is \"routine Michigan winter\" (cold, maybe slick spots) while afternoon/evening travel sees reduced visibility and accumulating snow. This pattern almost always favors school being in session with attention to the trip home.\n\n2) DISAGREEMENTS / NUANCES\n- The only mild tension is between the raw meteorological model for Rockford (~2\" daytime) and the NWS regional advisory headline of 4–6\" for the broader area. The historian notes Rockford is on the lower-impact side of that gradient, which resolves the difference.\n- Safety labels morning commute impact as \"moderate\" due to refreeze potential, while meteorology labels it as essentially dry—these are consistent when interpreted as: no fresh snow, but still some slick spots.\n- News intel sentiment is \"uncertain\" rather than strongly expecting a closure; there is one Thursday closure (Kent City) but no clear Friday domino effect yet.\nOverall, there is no major conflict—just different emphases.\n\n3) PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Safety analyst confirms: from 12:00 AM to at least 11:00 AM Friday, model shows 0.0 mm precip and 0.0 cm snow each hour.\n- That gives plow crews the whole night and early morning to clean up prior snow and treat for refreeze.\n- The main event STARTS around 12:00 PM, well AFTER buses and cars are at school.\n- For the specific 4–8 AM window (covering a 7:40 AM bus time), there is NO new accumulation at all.\n- So there is not \"X hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\"; instead, the new event hasn’t started yet. From a school-start perspective, this is ideal: roads may be cold/slick in spots, but crews are not chasing active falling snow.\n\n4) ICE RISK\n- Meteorologist: temps 21–23°F in the morning, rising to upper 20s by afternoon; no signals of a warm layer aloft or mixed precip. Dew points well below freezing; all modeled precip is snow.\n- Safety: describes only \"moderate\" ice formation risk driven by refreeze and residual moisture—no glaze or freezing rain.\n- Conclusion: No significant ice or mixed precip event. Risk is confined to localized black ice on bridges/untreated spots, which is routine for mid-January Michigan and not a primary closure trigger.\n\n5) NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel (secret weapon) at 23:15Z: \n  - No confirmed Friday, Jan 16 closures, delays, or e-learning days yet for Rockford, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Forest Hills, Grand Rapids, Northview, Lowell, Greenville, Comstock Park, or Kent City.\n  - Kent City was closed Thursday, Jan 15, but there is no indication of continuation into Friday.\n- With **zero** confirmed neighboring Friday closures as of this snapshot, there is NO basis for the +15–20% adjustment that would come from 3+ neighboring districts being closed.\n- Community sentiment is labeled \"uncertain,\" not strongly pushing for a snow day; there is no clear social-media drumbeat that \"everything will be closed.\"\n\n6) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nKey ways this prediction could fail high or low:\n- If the snow onset shifts earlier by 4–6 hours and moderate/heavy snow starts before or during the 5–8 AM commute, closure odds would jump sharply into the 35–50%+ range (bad timing). Current tools show no sign of that, but timing shifts are the biggest risk.\n- If a surprise band of freezing drizzle or a thin glaze developed toward morning (not currently supported by soundings or models) and caused widespread ice, closures would be more likely.\n- If by late evening multiple major neighboring districts (Forest Hills, GRPS, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell) preemptively announce closures for Friday based on evolving conditions, there could be a superintendent-driven domino effect.\n- If overnight lake-effect enhancement focuses directly over Rockford instead of west of US‑131 and produces 3–5\" BEFORE dawn (not the current forecast), this would push toward at least a delay or closure.\nGiven the alignment between the meteorological tools and the safety analysis, these are lower-probability failure modes but still worth monitoring.\n\nQUANTITATIVE PROBABILITY SETTING\nBase rate from history (historian, weight 20%):\n- Historical analogs for advisory-level, midday-onset events in Kent County show ~10–20% snow-day rates.\n- Seasonal context and Rockford’s high tolerance for snow favor the low end of closure probabilities.\n- I take a **historical baseline of ~15%**.\n\nMeteorology (weight 35%):\n- No pre-dawn accumulation; ~2\" total new snow during/after school; advisory-level winds; no ice; no extreme cold.\n- This pattern strongly points to school operating normally with only afternoon complications.\n- On meteorology alone, closure probability looks about **10–15%**.\n\nSafety assessment (weight 25%):\n- Morning: moderate risk but manageable with standard precautions; no call to cancel.\n- Afternoon: significant risk for slower buses and after-school travel; safety suggestions are to operate normally in the morning and reconsider only if timing shifts earlier.\n- This suggests closure probability of about **15–20%** (safety keeping slightly higher due to refreeze and bus concerns but still favoring open).\n\nNews & community intel (weight 20% – secret weapon):\n- No Friday closures announced yet for any neighbors, and no clear community consensus expecting a snow day.\n- Kent City’s Thursday closure shows the week has been disruptive but is not, by itself, a trigger for Friday.\n- Absence of a closure wave argues AGAINST a high-probability snow day. This component points to around **15–20%**.\n\nWeighted synthesis:\n- Meteorology (35% at ~12%) ≈ 4.2\n- Safety (25% at ~18%) ≈ 4.5\n- History (20% at ~15%) ≈ 3.0\n- News (20% at ~18%) ≈ 3.6\nSum ≈ 15.3%. \nGiven the modest but real advisory and afternoon travel issues—and the possibility of late-evening timing shifts—I nudge slightly upward for precaution and round to **18%** rather than dropping all the way to the strict historical mean.\n\nThis 18% is outside the discouraged 40–60% band and reflects a clear stance: school is very likely to be in session, but a closure is not impossible if the forecast unexpectedly shifts.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- Predicted outcome: **Rockford Public Schools are more likely than not to be OPEN on Friday, Jan 16, 2026 with a normal start time.**\n- Snow day probability: **18%**.\n- Primary concern is the **trip home and evening activities**, not the morning commute.\n",
