  "decision_rationale": "1) AGREEMENTS ACROSS EXPERTS\n- Meteorology: Cold, dry, no new snow or ice storm for Sunday night into Monday; just localized freezing fog/black ice Sunday late evening.\n- Safety: Primary/secondary roads and lots rated 8–9/10, with minimal commute impact and a recommendation for normal school operations.\n- History: Similar cold, dry high-pressure patterns with subzero wind chills but no storm have produced only ~5–10% snow day rates in Rockford/West Michigan.\n- News/Community: No storm headlines, no winter storm advisories specific to Dec. 15, no pre-announced closures or strong social-media drumbeat expecting a snow day.\nAll four strongly align that this is a typical cold winter day, not a closure-level event.\n\n2) DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no material conflicts. The only nuance: the meteorologist and safety analyst note freezing fog and patchy black ice risk overnight, but both treat it as localized and manageable, not district-wide disruptive.\n\n3) PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New accumulating snow: 0\". Plows are not dealing with a fresh storm.\n- Any required work is routine maintenance and touch-up on residual snowpack and refreeze.\n- Since there is no snowfall end-time before 7:40 AM (because no new snow), road crews effectively have unlimited lead time. That yields near-max readiness by the morning commute.\n\n4) ICE CONSIDERATION\n- Ice risk is from freezing fog creating patchy black ice late Sunday night (21:00–23:00) and residual refreeze on bridges/parking lots.\n- Safety and meteorology both frame this as spotty and expected in Michigan winter, not a widespread glaze event or freezing rain.\n- No ice storm, no widespread glaze, no major power outages. This does not rise to the ‘ice changes everything’ threshold.\n\n5) NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel explicitly checked neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n- None have posted closures, delays, or strong ‘watch Monday’ language for Dec. 15.\n- Regional closing lists (e.g., WOOD TV8) are quiet for this date.\n- Therefore, the +15–20% adjustment for 3+ neighboring closures does NOT apply. Community sentiment is closer to ‘routine winter’ than ‘big storm,’ so no upward adjustment.\n\n6) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nMain failure modes:\n- An unexpected late-developing event (e.g., surprise freezing drizzle or dense freezing fog widespread into Monday morning, causing much more ice than forecast).\n- A rapidly colder-than-expected air mass pushing sustained wind chills below local closure thresholds (~-20°F or colder) right through the bus window.\n- A significant, unforecast lake-effect band parking over bus routes overnight.\nGiven current data and lack of storm headlines or watches, these are low-probability but worth monitoring early Monday.\n\n7) WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong signal of 0\" new snow, no storm, moderate winds, and only localized freezing fog. This heavily favors staying open and drives the base probability near the low end of the Michigan threshold table (5–15%).\n- Safety (25%): Road and travel scores (8–9/10) and explicit recommendation for normal operations sharply reduce closure likelihood. This supports the lower part of the 5–15% band.\n- History (20%): Analog patterns show roughly 5–10% closure rate in similar setups. This anchors the estimate just above zero but firmly below mid-range probabilities.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No storm-focused coverage, no advisories, no multi-district closures, and only generic community chatter indicate no social or institutional momentum toward closing. This keeps us from adding any of the +10–20% adjustments.\n\n8) NUMERIC DECISION\nMichigan thresholds:\n- 0\" new snow and no ice storm → falls below the <4\" category, which itself is 5–15% in storm cases.\n- Adjusting for: no storm, good roads, low-intensity community concern, and historical analogs, I set the final probability at 8%.\nThis is low but non-zero, acknowledging residual black ice and the small chance of an overnight surprise, while clearly signaling that a normal school day is strongly favored.",
