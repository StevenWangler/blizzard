    "Only ~1\" additional snow expected, with accumulating precipitation largely done before the main 4–8 AM school window.",
    "Temperatures stay below freezing but steady (upper 20s to near 31°F), favoring refreeze and patchy black ice rather than major new accumulation.",
    "Historical analogs for similar advisory-level lake-effect/clipper events in late November around Rockford show roughly a 5–15% snow day rate, even with slick roads.",
    "Michigan districts, including Rockford, routinely operate with 1–3\" snow and wind chills in the teens; conditions fall well below typical closure thresholds (no blizzard, no 8\"+, no extreme cold).",
    "Safety assessment points to moderate risk with manageable impacts: treated main roads expected to be passable, with primary concerns on secondary roads, bridges, and parking lots—more consistent with caution or at most a delay than full closure."

  "decision_rationale": "Synthesis of meteorological, historical, and safety analyses strongly favors school being open.\n\nMeteorology: The event is winding down by the critical school decision window. Forecast shows low additional QPF and snow probabilities dropping to near zero after midnight. Total additional snowfall is around 1\", with peak rates only about 0.5\"/hr and mainly earlier. Winds have been gusty but are trending downward into the morning, and visibility recovers to 6+ miles. This eliminates two of the big closure drivers: ongoing heavy precip and sustained poor visibility.\n\nImpacts: The main issue is refreeze/black ice due to 24+ hours below freezing and leftover moisture from earlier snow/freezing drizzle. That creates localized slick spots, especially on untreated secondary roads, hills, curves, and elevated surfaces (bridges/overpasses, parking lots). However, primary routes are expected to be plowed and salted before the commute, and there is no indication of crews being overwhelmed by rate or volume.\n\nHistory: The closest analog patterns—light advisory-level lake-effect/clipper events with temps near 30°F and 1–3\" total—produce snow days on the order of 5–15% in this region. Additional seasonal/context adjustment is downward, since Rockford is used to exactly this setup and typically runs on time. None of the usual high-probability closure conditions (widespread 8\"+, whiteout/blizzard, or dangerous cold) are present.\n\nSafety: The safety assessment notes moderate risk, but explicitly frames this as a delay/extra caution scenario unless unexpected ongoing freezing drizzle or new snow bursts persist right at commute time. Emergency access concerns are low, and there is no indication that major arterial routes will be impassable.\n\nBalancing these factors, the most probable outcome is a normal school day with cautious driving and extra salting, possibly with isolated districts or rural routes seeing minor adjustments. That aligns with a low but nonzero closure probability. Given Michigan-specific thresholds and historical rates, a 14% snow day probability is appropriate and decisively outside the 40–60% indecision range.",
