  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorologist: Calls this a legitimately high-impact event for West Michigan, not a routine clipper. Expects 8–11\" with heaviest snow from ~12–7/8 AM, 1–2\"/hr rates, slushy/slick roads, blowing snow, and poor visibility during the 6–8 AM commute.\n- Safety analyst: Rates risk as severe with severe morning-commute impact, moderate afternoon impact, and strongly recommends a full closure. Emphasizes that a 2-hour delay does not move buses out of the primary hazard window.\n- Historian: Notes that similar overnight 8–12\" wet-snow events with 3–9 AM peak have produced snow days roughly half the time, mainly when rural routes and visibility are clearly bad at 4–5 AM. Places this in borderline-to-probable closure territory.\n- News intel: Confirms no early closures or delays posted yet and no big regional media push tonight for guaranteed closures; community sentiment is ‘wait and see,’ not ‘this is overblown’ or ‘this is nothing.’\n\nAll four agree this is a significant storm for early December with real travel hazards in the morning; none suggest it is minor or easily handled.\n\n2. Expert disagreements\n- There is no direct conflict, but there is **difference in emphasis**:\n  • Meteorology + Safety lean strongly toward closure based on intensity, timing, and visibility.\n  • Historical patterns show only about a 45–60% closure rate in similar setups because West Michigan is snow-tolerant and can sometimes operate with heavy, wet snow if roads are plowed enough by start time.\n  • News intel shows no advance closure wave and no strong community expectation either way; this pulls probability slightly down from a “near certain” closure because we are not seeing a strong expectation signal yet.\n\nGiven the weighting: Meteorology (35%), Safety (25%), History (20%), News (20%), the net signal leans clearly pro-closure, but not at 90%+ because there is still a meaningful chance that plows and real-time decisions keep schools open.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Heavy snow runs approximately 12 AM–7/8 AM with rates up to 1–2\"/hr, followed by lighter snow and blowing/drifting through midday.\n- School decision window is ~4–6 AM; first buses and high school drivers around ~6:30–7:40 AM.\n- That means:\n  • From storm onset (~12 AM) to first buses (~6:30 AM): only about 6.5 hours, much of it with high rates.\n  • From approximate end of heaviest snow (~7–8 AM) to student arrival (~7:40–8:00 AM): at best 0–60 minutes in many parts of the district, with ongoing drifting.\n- Safety analysis explicitly notes plows will struggle to keep up on secondary and rural routes from ~2–9 AM. Primary roads might be plowed repeatedly but remain snow-covered/slushy; side streets and hills lag behind.\n- Net: Plow timing is unfavorable; there is **not** a multi-hour window between heavy snow ending and buses rolling.\n\n4. Ice presence\n- Temperatures hover 31–36°F with heavy wet snow. There is mention of previous-day ice/freezing drizzle underneath and a refreeze risk as temps fall below 32°F in the afternoon.\n- For the **morning**, the main hazard is heavy, wet slush and very slick surfaces—not a pure glaze ice event. However, the combination of wet pavement near freezing and compacted snow creates rutted, slippery conditions, especially on untreated surfaces, bus stops, and parking lots.\n- Conclusion: Not an ice storm, but **wet slush + underlying slickness** elevates risk beyond simple powder snow.\n\n5. Neighboring district status\n- News intel clearly reports that as of late evening Dec. 9, there are **no advance closures** for Rockford or its typical peer districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n- Local TV and web closing boards are not yet showing a region-wide wave for Dec. 10; outlets are directing families to check early-morning lists instead.\n- Social sentiment is ‘uncertain/wait and see,’ not a strong ‘everything will be closed’ expectation.\n- Under the given rules, because 3+ neighbors are **not** already closed, we **do not** apply the +15–20% closure bump. Likewise, community is not saying ‘this is nothing,’ so we do not push probability down on that basis.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Wrong on the **high side** (schools open despite a 78% closure prediction) if:\n  • Heavy snow band shifts slightly, yielding more like 5–7\" instead of near 10\" in Rockford.\n  • Rates underperform (closer to 0.5–1\"/hr than 1–2\"/hr) so crews can keep up overnight, and by 5–6 AM most key routes are slushy but manageable.\n  • Visibility is better than expected and winds are a bit lower, giving superintendents confidence rural routes are passable.\n  • Decision-makers lean heavily on Michigan’s snow tolerance and choose to run, perhaps with slow buses but no major crash/visibility concerns.\n\n- Wrong on the **low side** (true risk closer to near-certain closure) if:\n  • Totals verify toward the high end or exceed 10–11\", with intense rates lingering into the 5–8 AM window.\n  • Visibility frequently drops to near-whiteout in bursts, particularly on rural routes.\n  • Multiple neighboring districts quickly announce closures between ~4–6 AM, reinforcing a regional ‘this is too rough to run’ consensus.\n\nWEIGHTING BY EXPERT DOMAIN\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Strong closure-leaning signal. Based on the described timing, totals, and poor visibility, this alone might suggest around 70–80% closure odds.\n- Safety analyst (25%): Explicit, strong recommendation for full closure and clear statement that a 2-hour delay does not help. This pushes the combined signal up, toward 80–85%.\n- Historian (20%): Historical analogs give about 45–60% closure rates for similar storms. This moderates the probability down from the mid-80s into the 70s.\n- News intel (20%): No advance closure wave and only moderate concern in public discourse. This also nudges probability down slightly because in truly obvious closure cases, media and communities often show stronger signals the night before.\n\nQUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS\n- Base from meteorology alone, considering Michigan thresholds: 8–11\" with poor timing is in the 60–85% band. Set initial at ~75%.\n- Safety severity and explicit closure recommendation: +5–10% → push up toward ~80–85%.\n- Historical closure rate for similar events (not near-certain): –10% relative to that safety push → down toward ~72–75%.\n- Lack of pre-announced neighbor closures but no ‘this is nothing’ sentiment: small downward nudge (–0 to –3%), but kept modest because decisions are explicitly expected in early AM → final settle near **78%** as a balanced point acknowledging strong hazard but some Michigan-tolerance and historical variance.\n\nWhy avoid 40–60% here?\n- Expert opinions are not in deep conflict; all three technical domains (weather, safety, history) agree this is a serious event with a meaningful chance of closure. The disagreement is about how often similar storms end up being handled without a snow day, not about whether conditions will be hazardous.\n- With heavy snow continuing through the decision and commute window and a safety expert calling a delay ineffective, true uncertainty is narrower: more like 65–85% than a coin flip.\n\nTherefore, a **78% snow day probability** with **high confidence** best reflects the multi-expert synthesis: closure more likely than not, but non-trivial chance of an on-time (or possibly risky) school day if plows and decision-makers push to operate.\n",
