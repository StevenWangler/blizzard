  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis (weighted by directive):\n\n1) Expert agreement: All experts converge on a ‘cold-and-slick’ setup with low likelihood of a full closure; the main hazard is residual hard-pack/black ice on secondary/neighborhood roads during 5–9 AM, not a fresh snowstorm.\n\n2) Disagreements/conflicts: Safety/infrastructure flag a moderate commute risk window despite little new precip. Web verification also raised a feels-like discrepancy. I resolved this by tool-checking Monday 5–9 AM wind chills and neighboring-district status: Weather.com shows a minimum near -19°F (not ≤ -20°F), and no confirmed Monday closures in nearby districts.\n\n3) Plow timing math: With no new snow indicated in the provided Sunday forecast, there’s no ‘snow-end-to-7:40 AM’ plow window to compute. Operationally, infrastructure monitoring indicates county primaries are likely passable by ~6:30 AM Monday, with lingering slick spots; local streets remain the largest variability.\n\n4) Any ice? There is no explicit freezing rain signal, but refreeze/black ice risk is moderate due to persistent cold and packed snow/treated surfaces—this supports delays more than full closure.\n\n5) Neighboring districts: No accessible evidence of a Monday 1/26 closure/delay cluster for Rockford-area districts. Prior disruptions (Thu/Fri) are noted but are not, by themselves, a Monday driver.\n\n6) Power outage concerns: Consumers Energy snapshot indicates very low system-wide outages; outage-driven closure is a low-probability tail risk, not the base case.\n\n7) Wind chill verification: Cross-checking sources does NOT confirm ≤ -20°F during the Monday morning commute window; lowest verified value was ~-19°F. That keeps us below the ‘near-automatic’ closure trigger.\n\n8) What would make this wrong? (a) A late-forming lake-effect band overnight Sun→Mon causing a quick 1–3\" with poor visibility; (b) verified widespread black ice on bus-route secondaries (not just spotty bridges); (c) a localized school-building power/boiler failure in the extreme cold.\n\nWeighted decision: Meteorology (no new snow/limited wind) anchors low closure odds; safety/infrastructure add a modest bump for hard-pack/black ice; news does not support a closure cascade; power does not support outage-based closure; web verification keeps wind chill just short of the -20°F threshold. Net: 15% for a full snow day (closure).",
