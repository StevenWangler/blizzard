  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs disagreement\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • Meteorologist: Cold, quiet, dry; no snow or ice overnight or in the morning; light winds; generally good visibility.\n  • Historian: Very low historical closure rate (1–3%) for cold, dry, post-storm days with no active precip and wind chills roughly in the -13°F to -16°F range.\n  • Safety analyst: No new precip; road scores 8–9/10; moderate black-ice risk only; conditions consistent with holding school on time.\n  • News intel: Rockford is monitoring conditions, adjusted Wednesday buses/events, but has NOT announced closures/delays; neighboring districts also show no pre-announced closures for Thursday.\n  → All four effectively agree that: there is no active storm Thursday morning, roads are serviceable with normal winter caution, and there is no current systemic push toward closure.\n\n- DISAGREEMENTS / TENSIONS:\n  • Safety labels overall risk as “moderate” and flags 5–8 AM as the trickiest period due mainly to cold plus refreeze. Meteorology and history downplay risk more strongly (\"very low\" closure likelihood). This is a difference in *safety framing*, not in the underlying facts.\n  • Visibility analysis shows a model blip to near-zero visibility that is explicitly called a data artifact; other experts implicitly ignore it. No true conflict once that’s accepted as noise.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Wednesday had deteriorating conditions and paved-roads-only bus routing, but:\n  • Forecast for after midnight through the Thursday morning commute: 0% new snow/ice.\n  • Temperatures stay well below freezing, so no thaw–refreeze cycles; just continued dry cold.\n- Effective plow window: from roughly late Wednesday afternoon/early evening through Thursday early morning.\n  • If last meaningful precipitation ends by Wednesday evening, plows and salt trucks have at least 8–10+ dry hours before a typical Rockford first-bus time (~6:30 AM) and school start (~7:40 AM).\n  • Safety analyst’s high road scores (8–9/10) support the view that this window is adequate for Michigan-standard crews.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: 0% chance of freezing rain or mixed precip; no new glazing expected.\n- Safety: “Moderate” ice formation risk refers to residual black ice from prior day’s event, mainly on untreated side streets, bridges, and lots.\n- Historian: Past days like this (dry, cold, light winds, no new precip) rarely drive closures unless paired with extreme wind chills (< -15°F to -20°F) or significant ice; those thresholds are not met.\n- Conclusion: Some patchy ice is likely, but there is no active icing event, no freezing rain, and no region-wide sheet of ice. This does *not* reach the “ice changes everything” category used for 60–85%+ closure probabilities.\n\n4. Neighboring districts\n- News intel: Major closing boards (FOX 17, etc.) show NO pre-announced closures or delays for Thursday among:\n  • Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD.\n- That means:\n  • No 3+ neighbor closure domino effect → no +15–20% probability bump.\n  • Regional signal currently favors normal operations.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Strong signal: 0\" forecast snow/ice, 0% precip during decision/commute windows, light winds, no alerts.\n  • This alone argues for <10% closure probability in Michigan. I anchor the base probability near ~4% from this.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Road scores are high; worst commute period is only “moderate” impact driven by cold and residual slick spots.\n  • Explicit recommendation: conditions “consistent with holding school on time rather than calling a snow day.”\n  • This nudges probability slightly *down* from any overreaction to Wednesday’s difficulties.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Analog days: 1–3% closure rate with very similar conditions.\n  • Confirms that Michigan districts typically stay open in this exact pattern.\n  • This keeps the estimate anchored in the very-low range.\n\n- News Intelligence (20% weight – secret weapon):\n  • No neighboring district closures → no upward domino adjustment.\n  • Community sentiment labeled “uncertain/wait-and-see,” not “everyone expects a snow day” and not “this is nothing,” so no strong sentiment-based bump up or down.\n  • Rockford’s Wednesday paved-roads-only decision and an evening concert postponement show *caution*, not incapacity; importantly, there is no Thursday-specific closure or strong hint.\n  • Net effect: I resist inflating probability based on Wednesday’s issues, because Thursday’s *forecast* is quiet.\n\n6. Putting it together and avoiding 40–60%\n- Baseline from meteorology + history: ~3–5%.\n- Safety’s moderate risk and known refreeze spots could justify a slight upward nudge (schools sometimes close or delay when prior-day conditions were worse than expected), but:\n  • There is no active storm.\n  • News intel confirms no region-wide preemptive closures and no clear community expectation of a snow day.\n- I set the final probability at 7% to respect:\n  • The very small but non-zero chance administrators react more conservatively after paved-roads-only service and an evening cancellation.\n  • While staying consistent with strong historical and meteorological evidence that school will almost certainly be open.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Main ways I could be wrong (snow day actually happens):\n  • Overnight verification shows much worse black ice than anticipated (e.g., widespread sheets of ice on hills and back roads), pushing transportation officials to cancel or delay despite no new precip.\n  • An unforecast band of light snow or freezing drizzle develops early Thursday, reducing visibility and traction right during the 4–7 AM decision window.\n  • A late-evening reassessment by multiple nearby districts produces a sudden cluster of closures/delays, and Rockford follows the domino trend.\n- Ways I could be wrong (school open but I overestimated risk):\n  • Road crews overperform, treating every known slick spot so thoroughly that the commute feels nearly normal, implying a true probability closer to 2–3%.\n\nGiven all current evidence, though, a closure remains unlikely, and keeping the probability in the single digits should produce a strong Brier score if schools indeed open as expected.",
