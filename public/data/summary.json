  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Clear, cold, and dry; 0% chance of snow or rain; no ice signal; typical winter day. Implied snow-day probability ~0–1%.\n- Historian (20% weight): Very low historical closure rate (1–3%) for similar cold, dry December days; Rockford typically stays open unless there is heavy snow, ice, or extreme cold (<-15°F to -20°F wind chills). Implied probability ~1–3%.\n- Safety analyst (25% weight): Roads mostly good (8–9/10), low risk level, only patchy black ice possible; explicitly calls this a standard cold-weather school day and says the probability of needing a snow day is very low. Implied probability ~5% or less.\n- News & community intel (20% weight): Rockford Public Schools are already closed for winter break starting Monday 12/22. No regional storm or neighboring-district closure signals for that date; social/media sentiment is quiet. From a *weather* perspective this reinforces a near-zero snow-day signal; from a calendar perspective, there is no K–12 day to cancel.\n\nWhere they agree:\n- No accumulating snow or active storm on 12/22.\n- No freezing rain or widespread ice; only localized refreeze risk.\n- Temperatures are cold but not at extreme cold-closure thresholds for Michigan.\n- Typical operations would proceed as normal if school were in session.\n\nWhere they disagree:\n- The safety analyst flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk and labels 5–8 AM as a time of \"moderate\" commute impact due to patchy black ice and mist, while the meteorologist sees no explicit ice signal (no precip, just mist/low clouds). This is more a difference in emphasis than a fundamental conflict: meteorology says no storm-driven hazard; safety notes localized operational caution needs. Both still conclude conditions are compatible with a normal school day.\n- The news intel introduces a key non-weather factor: the district is closed for planned winter break. That doesn’t contradict the others; it simply makes a weather-based snow day moot.\n\nGiven the instructions, I still compute a weather-based snow-day probability, then note that the calendar closure dominates the real-world outcome.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total new snow: 0\" forecast from Sunday night through Monday.\n- Worst road conditions window per safety analyst: 05:00–08:00, driven by cold temps (16–22°F), refreeze of residual moisture, and possible mist causing patchy black ice on bridges and side streets.\n- Typical first-bell time given: ~7:40 AM.\n- Since there is no overnight or ongoing accumulation, plow operations are largely maintenance from prior days. Main routes should be in good condition well before 5 AM.\n- Effective \"hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\": functionally infinite, because the snow already ended days earlier. Operationally, road crews have had >24–48 hours to address prior snowpack; remaining issues are spotty, not systemic.\n- Result: Plow timing does not constrain safety in a way that would justify delays or closures.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no measurable drizzle, and no new precip. Temperatures stay below freezing in the morning, but in the absence of active precip they do not expect glaze formation.\n- Safety: Notes possible light mist plus refreeze on bridges/untreated spots, leading to patchy black ice, especially 5–7 AM. This elevates localized risk but not to district-wide closure levels.\n- Synthesis: There is *some* ice risk, but it is localized and typical for Michigan winter mornings. It is not the kind of broad, storm-driven ice (widespread freezing rain or flash freeze under active precip) that would push probability into the 60–85%+ closure thresholds described in your rules.\n\n4. Neighboring districts\n- News intel explicitly reports no evidence that Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or other Kent-area districts are planning or discussing weather-based closures for Monday, December 22. Any closures currently in the news are tied to other days or to the late-week (Dec 18–19) system.\n- Therefore, there is no regional domino effect or \"3+ neighboring districts closed\" criterion triggered. No +15–20% upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n5. Weighting the experts\nUsing the provided weights and the content of each analysis:\n- Meteorologist (35%): With 0\" snow and no storm/ice, a reasonable numerical estimate is ~1% snow-day probability if school were in session. Contribution: 0.35 × 1 ≈ 0.35.\n- Safety analyst (25%): Labels risk as low, roads mostly good, and explicitly says probability of needing a snow day is very low. Assign ~3%. Contribution: 0.25 × 3 = 0.75.\n- Historian (20%): Historical analogs: 1–3% closure rate. Take midpoint 2%. Contribution: 0.20 × 2 = 0.4.\n- News intel (20%): No storm buzz, no neighboring closures, no community concern. As a pure *weather* signal, this supports ~1–2%. Take 1.5%. Contribution: 0.20 × 1.5 = 0.3.\n\nWeighted weather-based probability ≈ 0.35 + 0.75 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.8%, which rounds naturally to about 2%.\n\n6. Applying Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Snow amount: 0\" → well below the <4\" band (5–15%) in your Michigan rules.\n- Ice: Only minor localized refreeze; no true ice storm, no freezing rain. So we do not invoke the 60–85%+ category for ice.\n- There is no extreme cold; wind chills around -5 to 0°F are above typical cold-closure thresholds.\n- No blizzard conditions or high winds.\nGiven these thresholds, the correct band is at or even below the 5–15% category. The cross-expert weighted calculation of ~2% is consistent with that framework and appropriately decisive for Brier-score optimization.\n\n7. Calendar reality vs. weather probability\n- Calendar reality: Rockford Public Schools are not scheduled to hold regular K–12 classes on Monday, December 22, 2025. The district is on winter break; any closure that day would be a calendar closure, not a weather-driven snow day.\n- Practical interpretation: Even if weather were marginally worse, it would not generate a snow day in the usual sense because there is no school to cancel.\n- Therefore, the operationally relevant question becomes: Would weather reasonably justify cancelling the limited Parkside preschool programming? Based on the same analyses, the answer is also “very unlikely,” given good main roads and only standard winter caution needed.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\nKey failure modes:\n- An unexpectedly developing freezing-drizzle event Sunday night into Monday that is not captured in current guidance, leading to widespread glaze on roads and sidewalks.\n- A last-minute change in the synoptic setup causing a surprise lake-effect band to park over Rockford with several inches of sudden accumulation during the 4–8 AM window.\n- Unseen localized infrastructure issue (major water main break, heating failure, or power outage) affecting school buildings or the preschool facility specifically.\n\nAll of these would represent a significant deviation from the current forecast and safety assessments; present data show no strong signal for them.\n\nGiven all four expert streams and the Michigan-specific closure thresholds, the best calibrated, decisive forecast is a ~2% weather-related snow-day probability, with high confidence that normal operations (where scheduled) can proceed.\n",
