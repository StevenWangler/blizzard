  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT\n- Meteorology: Storm is essentially over by Sunday; Monday 1/12 is cold, breezy, and dry with 0% precip and 0\" new snow.\n- History: Very similar past setups (3–5\" advisory event ending Sunday, dry Monday, typical cold) yield only ~5–10% snow-day rates. Schools in this region are used to operating in this.\n- Safety: Road risk is explicitly low. Primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10, driving conditions 8/10. Only concern is some refreeze/black ice in spots.\n- News/Intelligence: No hints of closures; all checked districts (Rockford, Forest Hills, GRPS and nearby) show normal Monday operations and no weather alerts or chatter.\n\nThere are no substantive conflicts between the four experts:\n- All agree: main snow is Saturday–Sunday; Monday has no active storm; conditions are improving; closure likelihood is low.\n- Minor nuance: Safety flags “moderate” ice-formation risk, but scores commuting conditions highly and still calls risk low. That is consistent, not contradictory.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions: Sunday 1/11, roughly 00:00–18:00.\n- By Sunday late afternoon/evening, snow is tapering and winds gradually ease.\n- School start / first buses: ~7:00–7:40 AM Monday 1/12.\n\nFrom roughly Sunday 18:00 to Monday 07:00 is about 13 hours of non-accumulating time, plus several preceding hours of decreasing intensity. Crews can:\n- Plow/ salt primary routes Sunday afternoon/evening.\n- Clean up secondary routes and lots overnight.\n\nEffective plow window to Monday bus time: about 12–15 hours after main accumulating snow ends. That is plenty for a 3–5\" advisory event in West Michigan, where crews are experienced and infrastructure is designed for this. This strongly favors school being open.\n\n3. ICE / MIXED PRECIP\n- Forecast temperatures: upper 20s overnight into bus time; rising above freezing in the afternoon.\n- No freezing rain or drizzle indicated; precip probability is 0% for Monday.\n- Ice signal: only residual refreeze/black ice on untreated or shaded spots. Safety analyst labels ice-formation risk as \"moderate\" but still gives driving an 8/10 and explicitly recommends a normal start.\n\nCritically, there is no glaze ice event, no active wintry mix at commute, and no strong reason to expect widespread dangerous ice. That keeps this far from the “ice changes everything / 60%+ closure” category.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICT BEHAVIOR\n- Rockford Public Schools: No Monday 1/12 weather notices; calendar shows normal school. Next planned closure is for PD on 1/19.\n- Forest Hills Public Schools: Normal board activities; no weather messaging.\n- Grand Rapids Public Schools: Normal events, no closure alerts.\n- Quick checks of Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD show no prominent Monday closure headlines.\n\nNet: 0 neighboring closures (and no strong hints). Per the weighting rules, the +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring closures does NOT apply. News intel and community sentiment (“no_buzz”) both push the probability toward the bottom of the historical range.\n\n5. WEIGHTED EXPERT SYNTHESIS\nUsing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Forecast supports a very low closure chance. If considered alone, this suggests ~5–10%. I anchor meteorology contribution around 7%.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, normal operations recommended. This also implies low single digits to maybe ~10%. Weighting this, I keep the combined meteorology+safety signal close to ~7–8%.\n- History (20%): Analog events yield 5–10% snow-day rates. That aligns tightly with the other two. This reinforces staying in the low single digits to around 10%.\n- News Intelligence (20% – secret weapon): No early closure signals, no buzz, neighboring districts expecting normal days. This leans to the low end of the historical range, pulling the combined probability down rather than up.\n\nBlending these: all four components converge between roughly 5% and 10%. No offsetting factor (like ice, surprise storm, power/road crisis, or neighboring preemptive closures) pushes it higher. Given Michigan’s higher tolerance and the advisory-level nature of the storm, I set the final probability at 7% to be precise but still respect a small residual risk from patchy ice or isolated rural drift issues.\n\n6. WHY NOT HIGHER, GIVEN RECENT SNOW?\nMichigan thresholds from your rubric:\n- <4\" snow: 5–15% (routine) \n- 4–6\" snow: 15–35%\n\nThis event is roughly 3–5\" and, crucially, ends the day before. The higher 15–35% band applies when 4–6\" overlaps directly with the commute or cleanup window is very short. Here, timing is favorable and Monday is dry. That places this day firmly in the lower band.\n\n7. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nFactors that could push from 7% toward an actual closure:\n- Forecast bust: if new, unanticipated lake-effect bands set up overnight right over Rockford with several more inches, cutting into plow time and producing poor visibility at bus time.\n- Underrated ice: if melting and refreeze plus any surprise drizzle create widespread black ice on hills and rural roads, leading to many accidents or road-commission warnings.\n- Infrastructure issue: major plow/mechanical failures, significant staffing shortages, or a spike in power outages impacting buildings or traffic signals.\n- Policy surprise: if several key neighboring districts call off late Sunday night based on hyper-local issues not captured in the current data, Rockford might follow in a domino effect.\n\nGiven the current evidence, all of those are low-probability contingencies. That justifies a 7% estimate with high, but not absolute, confidence.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: For Monday, January 12, 2026 in Rockford, MI, conditions match a typical post-storm cleanup day with adequate plow time, no new snow, and only routine winter cold. Historically and operationally, that almost always results in a normal school day.",
