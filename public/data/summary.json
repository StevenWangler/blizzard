    "Residual/legacy slick-spot risk (black ice on bridges/ramps, packed snow on neighborhood streets/parking lots) is the main plausible disruptor—but evidence suggests it would be isolated, not widespread.",

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, and infrastructure, the core signal is a cold-but-quiet Monday: no meaningful snow/ice accumulation, light winds, and no visibility issues—conditions that almost never produce a full closure in Rockford/West Michigan. The web verification shows cross-site temperature/feels-like inconsistencies, but critically, no credible source captured here shows wind chill ≤ -20°F during 6–8 AM, so the extreme-cold automatic closure rule does not apply. The main upward adjustments come from (1) Forest Hills already calling a 2-hour delay (a real domino/context clue) and (2) the only realistic hazard being legacy slick spots from prior moisture/compaction refreezing in single-digit temps. However, with no confirmation of widespread icy roads or an outage cluster, the most Brier-optimal call remains strongly ‘OPEN,’ with a small but non-zero chance of a delay or surprise operational issue. Net: low single-digit closure odds; if anything happens, a delay is more plausible than a closure.",
