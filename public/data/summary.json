    "No meaningful winter precip signal in the primary forecast (0\" snow/0\" precip) and rapid warming after sunrise—Michigan districts almost always stay open in this setup",
    "Main hazard is freezing fog during bus/commute window (~6:30–9:00 AM): visibility around ~1 mile and potential patchy bridge/untreated-surface glaze (black ice)",
    "Web verification shows a non-zero forecast disagreement: Weather.com hints at light snow showers/possibly up to 1–3\" in its 10-day view, which is the main ‘forecast bust’ tail risk",
    "No domino-effect signals: Rockford and nearby districts (Forest Hills, Northview, Kentwood, Sparta, Lowell, GRPS) show no posted delays/closures; community sentiment shows no buzz",
    "Wind chill is not near extreme-cold closure thresholds (no credible source ≤ -20°F); power-outage risk appears low"

  "decision_rationale": "All experts broadly align on a low closure likelihood: the meteorologist and historian emphasize a dry forecast with rapid warming (a classic ‘open’ day in West Michigan), while the safety analyst flags a real but typically localized risk from freezing fog during the 6:30–9:00 AM window (visibility + isolated black-ice). News intel finds no Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay signals—an important tiebreaker in Michigan where domino closures often precede broad shutdowns.\n\nThe one meaningful conflict is precipitation guidance: WeatherAPI shows 0\" precip/snow, while Weather.com displays hints of light snow showers and even 1–3\" on its 10-day page. The meteorologist follow-up still supports the ‘dry/near-dry’ solution (only ~5% snow probability, 0\" accumulation). Because even a brief, unexpected snow shower or thin glaze during 6–9 AM can spike crash risk, I keep a non-trivial tail risk—but not enough to overcome Michigan’s high closure threshold.\n\nBottom line: Expect Rockford to be OPEN, possibly with extra caution messaging; a 2-hour delay is more plausible than a full closure if fog is thicker than forecast or if spotty glazing is observed on bridges/rural connectors. I set 12% for a full snow-day closure to account for the cross-model precip discrepancy and fog/ice micro-risk, while still optimizing for Michigan’s typical ‘stay open unless widespread hazard’ reality.",
