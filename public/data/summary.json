    "No new snow/ice indicated in the provided forecast window; dry “cold-but-quiet” pattern is typically an OPEN day in West Michigan",
    "Wind chill risk appears below closure thresholds: best-estimate Mon 6–8 AM wind chill roughly ~-10°F to 0°F (web/API discrepancy exists, but still not in the ≤-20°F automatic-close range)",
    "Main hazard is second-order: patchy refreeze/black ice on bridges/shaded/rural roads plus possible freezing mist/fog reducing visibility near dawn",
    "Infrastructure signals suggest roads are generally clear with normal/spot-treatment posture; however LIVE Mi Drive confirmation was not available (adds uncertainty)",
    "No domino-effect signals: no confirmed Feb 2 closures/delays in neighboring districts, no community buzz, and negligible power outages"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Cross-referencing the six inputs, there is broad agreement that this is not a plowable snow event (0” forecast in the provided period, light winds, no accumulating precip signal). That alone puts Rockford in a very low closure regime historically (single digits). The only meaningful disagreement was how much to weight Monday-morning safety risk given the Sunday-vs-Monday hourly mismatch and a ~10°F wind-chill discrepancy between WeatherAPI and Weather.com.\n\nResolution: I treat Monday’s bus-hour wind chill as potentially colder than the API (safety-first), but the meteorologist’s Monday best estimate still keeps wind chill most likely around ~-6°F to -2°F and only a low chance of ≤-15°F, with a very low chance of ≤-20°F. Therefore, extreme-cold closure rules are NOT triggered.\n\nThat leaves patchy black ice/freezing fog as the key risk. Safety’s “moderate” risk level fits a *delay more than closure* pattern in West Michigan unless road checks find widespread glaze or visibility drops broadly to near-whiteout fog. Infrastructure and news signals do not show escalating conditions or a closure domino effect, and the power grid picture is stable.\n\nNet: I land slightly above the debate average (11%) at 12% to account for (a) the unresolved Monday-hourly verification gap and (b) the plausible freezing-fog/refreeze setup. Operationally, this reads as: likely OPEN, with a non-trivial chance of a 2-hour delay if early road checks discover systemwide slickness on secondary/rural routes.",
