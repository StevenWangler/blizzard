  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist: Snow ends by around midnight, no meaningful precip during the Thursday commute, cold but quiet weather.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads are manageable by morning (primary roads 8/10, secondary 7/10), with only residual slick spots and a moderate morning impact, minimal afternoon impact.\n- Historian: Nearly identical patterns (1–3\" advisory snow ending before the school day, cold/dry next day) very rarely trigger full snow days in Kent County (5–10% range, with delays more common than closures).\n- News/Intel: No neighboring district closures, no social media buzz about cancelling, no event cancellations or power issues; media frame this as nuisance lake‑effect followed by calmer, colder conditions.\n\nAll four agree this is a minor-to-moderate advisory event that *improves* by morning, not a high‑impact school-closure setup.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- Meteorology and Safety both call the morning commute cold with some slick spots but otherwise manageable.\n- History’s 5–10% closure rate matches the qualitative language in both Safety (“conditions align more with a cold but manageable school day”) and Meteorology (“strongly favors schools being open”).\n- News/Intel confirms the lack of closures or panic; it does not contradict any hazard details.\nBecause there is no meaningful disagreement, no cross‑checks or tool calls are needed.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (SNOW END → 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window from Safety: 2025-12-31T18:00 to 2026-01-01T07:00 (advisory event).\n- Meteorology: accumulating snow ends by around midnight with improving conditions overnight.\n- Typical Rockford/Kent County high‑priority plow operations: plows are active during and after the event, particularly from late evening through pre‑dawn.\n\nFrom effective snow end (~00:00) to first bell (~07:40) there are roughly 7–8 hours. That’s more than enough for:\n- Main routes: fully plowed and salted (supported by primary road score 8/10).\n- Secondary roads and lots: mostly treated, with some residual slick spots and refreeze (scores 7/10, moderate ice risk in patches).\nNet: Plow timing strongly favors normal operation — well outside the tight, problematic 0–3 hour window that often drives Michigan closures.\n\n4. ICE / MIXED PRECIP RISK\n- Meteorology: Precip type is snow, with accumulating snow/freezing mix ending late Wednesday; no new precip during the Thursday commute.\n- Safety: Flags only a *moderate* ice-formation risk from refreeze of what fell Wednesday (black ice in shaded/untreated spots and parking lots). No ongoing freezing rain or drizzle is forecast.\n- Historian: No mention of ice-storm or glaze conditions; explicitly notes no ice-storm-type risk that forces closures.\n\nSo: there is *some* refreeze/black ice, but no active ice storm, no new glaze accumulation, and no structural-icing or power issues. In Michigan terms, this is routine winter slickness, not a closure-class ice event.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICT STATUS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- News/Intel: Neighboring_district_closures: [], official_announcements: [], and social media sentiment: \"no_buzz\".\n- No reports of multi-district closures or widespread concern.\n\nPer instructions, if 3+ neighboring districts were closed, we’d add 15–20 percentage points. Here we see *zero* closures and no chatter, which supports staying on the *low* end of any probability band — no upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\nMain ways this 7% estimate could be off:\n- Forecast bust: If lake‑effect bands persist or redevelop over Rockford into the early morning, producing several more inches (pushing toward 4–6\" overlapping bus times) or surprise freezing drizzle, risk would increase. Current guidance and analysis, however, show snow ending and skies clearing.\n- Plow/treatment failure: If road commissions are understaffed or delayed (holiday impacts) and large areas of secondary roads remain untreated/icy by 6–7 AM, some districts might consider delays or targeted closures even without new snow. Safety scores and historical practice suggest crews will manage this normally.\n- Non‑weather factors: Unexpected issues such as localized power outages, a major crash blocking key routes, or school-specific facility problems could force closure independent of weather.\nGiven the cold but stable forecast, absence of new precip, and routine Michigan nature of the advisory event, these failure modes are plausible but low probability.\n\n7. WEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERT DOMAINS\nUsing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Direct conditions say cold, quiet, and improving. Implied closure probability from this alone is around 5–10%. I take ~8% from this component.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road and travel scores (7–8/10, moderate risk) align with normal operation. This argues for a very low closure probability, about 5–10%; I weight this toward ~7%.\n- History (20% weight): Explicitly estimates 5–10%, with context that closures in these conditions are rare. I take ~7% here.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): No closures or chatter suggests using the *bottom* of the plausible range, maybe ~3–5% if taken alone; I take ~5%.\n\nCombining these:\n(0.35 × 8) + (0.25 × 7) + (0.20 × 7) + (0.20 × 5)\n= 2.8 + 1.75 + 1.4 + 1.0\n≈ 6.95%, rounded to 7%.\n\nThis sits just below the historical 5–10% band and is consistent with:\n- Michigan threshold guidance: This is effectively a <4\" advisory event with no active snow during the commute → baseline 5–15%. Because there are no neighboring closures and conditions are improving, we choose the *low* end of that band.\n- Competition guidance: Avoid 40–60% unless truly torn. Here, all experts lean clearly toward open, so a decisive low probability is appropriate.\n\n8. FINAL DECISION\nGiven cold but quiet weather, >7 hours of plow/treatment time before first bell, only patchy refreeze risk, no additional accumulation, and no community signals of closure, the data-supported forecast is a *normal school day* with at most minor localized delays — not a full snow day.\n\nTherefore, I set the snow day probability at 7% with high confidence.",
