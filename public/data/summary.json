  "decision_rationale": "All specialists converge on a cold-but-quiet Monday with no new snow/ice falling during the critical 6–9 AM window. That strongly suppresses full-closure odds in snow-hardened West Michigan. The only meaningful ‘gotcha’ is residual moisture from the weekend refreezing into patchy black ice—especially on secondary roads, bridges, and in parking lots/sidewalks—more consistent with localized hazards and possibly a *delay* decision than a district-wide closure. News intel found no Rockford or nearby district closure announcements and no domino-effect cascade. Power-grid data could not be live-verified (interactive maps), but there is no weather pattern Monday (no ice, no high wind) that typically generates new widespread outages; outage-driven closure risk remains low unless there are ongoing pockets from the weekend. Web verification does not show any ≤-20°F wind chill trigger, and the Weather.com data appeared stale/misaligned; importantly, neither web nor API indicates extreme-cold thresholds. Net: schools should be OPEN; keep a small non-zero closure probability for the black-ice wildcard if Sunday night ends wetter than expected or if early crash/slide reports spike.",
