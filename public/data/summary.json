    "Infrastructure and power conditions are supportive: roads generally clear/normal patrol; outages essentially zero in Kent County (not a closure driver)"

  "decision_rationale": "This is not a weather-dependent snow day decision for Rockford Public Schools on Mon 2/16/2026 because the district is already officially closed for Mid-Winter Break (confirmed across the RPS academic calendar, district calendar, homepage reminders, and district news posts). Therefore the probability of a *weather-driven* closure announcement is effectively 0%.\n\nIf we ignore the calendar and evaluate weather-only operational risk: experts broadly agree there is no accumulating snow/ice event expected. The only meaningful hazard is freezing fog/low clouds with temps near 30–34°F, which can produce localized black ice (bridges/overpasses/shaded rural spots) and reduced visibility around bus hours. Historically in West Michigan, that setup rarely triggers a full closure without verified widespread glazing or widespread visibility <0.5 mile plus incident reports. Power grid conditions are stable (county-level outages essentially zero), and road agencies would typically be in patrol/spot-treatment mode—not overwhelmed. There is a forecast discrepancy where Weather.com looks colder/windier with a trace snow amount, but even that scenario does not meet extreme-cold closure thresholds and would mainly raise caution/slow travel rather than force a closure.\n\nRecommendation: treat Monday as a planned no-school day for RPS; no snow-day call is needed. If any optional programs/activities occur, consider delaying/canceling them only if dense fog (<0.5 mi) or confirmed widespread glazing is observed early Monday morning.",
