  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology: Clear, dry, cold day. 0% snow chance, 0.00\" precip, no active storm. Impacts limited to cold, patchy fog, and residual slick spots.\n- History: Matching past patterns show essentially no snow days in comparable setups; closure-level events in this region need heavy snow (8+ inches), active ice, or extreme wind chills. None apply.\n- Safety: Roads rated good (8–9/10). Morning commute risk marked \"moderate\" from fog/patchy ice, but no justification for closure—only routine caution and salting.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford closure announcements, no neighboring district closures, no strong community expectation of a snow day; regional narrative is warming and improvement, with bigger concerns later in the week.\nAll four experts agree there is *no active storm* and that conditions are within normal winter operating range. There are no substantive conflicts to resolve.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- New snow/precip: none overnight → nothing fresh to plow.\n- Prior light freezing rain occurred the previous day, but conditions have been dry and below freezing, giving road crews **all night** and much of the prior day to salt and scrape.\n- With no additional accumulation between midnight and the 7:40 AM start window, plow/salt operations are purely maintenance of residual icy spots, not catch-up during an event.\n- Effective \"hours from snow/ice end to 7:40 AM\" is >12 hours, which in Michigan with capable road crews is more than enough for primary and bus routes to be in good shape.\nConclusion: Plow timing strongly favors **school as normal**.\n\n3. Ice risk assessment\n- Temps: below freezing, but **no new freezing rain** or drizzle is forecast for the target morning.\n- Safety and meteorology both highlight **patchy black ice** from refreeze plus mist/fog. This elevates risk slightly for untreated surfaces, bridges, and parking lots, but does *not* resemble an ongoing ice storm.\n- Meteorology and news intel confirm that the serious ice-storm messaging pertains to a *different* time window later in the week, not Tuesday morning.\nThus, there is **some localized ice**, but not the kind of widespread, actively-developing glaze that triggers closures. It supports heightened caution, not cancellation.\n\n4. Neighboring districts & community signals\n- News intel: No pre-announced closures for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or other Kent ISD districts.\n- Rockford Public Schools website and calendar show Dec. 16 as a normal instructional day with no alerts.\n- Community sentiment is described as \"uncertain\" rather than strongly expecting a snow day; there is no narrative of \"everyone knows we’ll be closed.\"\nPer the weighting rules, the absence of neighboring closures means **no positive adjustment** (0%) to closure probability. If anything, it reinforces a low baseline.\n\n5. Quantitative probability reasoning\nBase on Michigan thresholds:\n- Snow: 0\" forecast → well below the 4\" lower threshold. That alone normally implies roughly 5–15% in a typical Michigan winter day *if* there were at least some active winter hazard. Here, there is literally no new snow/ice falling.\n- Ice: Not an ice storm; only residual patches. So we do **not** invoke the 60–85% ice/8\"+ category.\n- Wind chills: Teens, nowhere near the -15°F cold-closure benchmark.\n- Historical data: Similar dry, cold, overcast days with only minor fog/ice show approximately 0–5% snow-day rate.\n- Safety: Explicitly recommends normal operations; labels risk as manageable with standard precautions.\n- News intel: No closures, no strong buzz for a snow day, warming trend narrative.\nWeighting experts as directed:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly favors school open; I translate this to ~2–3% closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Rates roads good, only moderate commute risk → ~3–5%.\n- History (20%): Historical rate ~0–5%; I use ~2%.\n- News Intel (20%): No closure signals, no neighbor closures → ~2–3%.\nWeighted average sits around 2–4%. Given minor residual ice and fog, I choose **3%** to slightly exceed the absolute minimum while respecting that in Michigan, even small overnight surprises can occur.\n\n6. Why not higher / avoiding false inflation\n- There is **no storm** coinciding with the school morning.\n- Road conditions are already mostly recovered, not degrading.\n- Neighboring districts are not moving toward closure.\n- The historical snow-day rate in similar cases is near zero.\nRaising the probability into the teens or higher would overweight the patchy-ice and fog risks relative to the overwhelming signal of normal operations.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nA higher closure probability (or an actual closure) would likely require one of:\n- An unexpected **overnight freezing drizzle/fog event** that significantly glazes roads, especially rural bus routes, between midnight and 5–6 AM.\n- A surprise fog situation with **persistent sub-0.25 mile visibility** along major routes that county and district officials judge unsafe for buses.\n- A late-breaking **NWS advisory** and rapid cascade of neighboring-district closures before 5:30–6:00 AM, pressuring Rockford to align.\nAll of these involve new, unforecast deterioration that is *not* indicated in the current data but are why this is not a literal 0%.\n\nGiven all inputs and the competition need to be decisive with a strong Brier score, the best calibrated forecast is:\n- **Snow day probability: 3%** (school almost certainly in session as normal).",
