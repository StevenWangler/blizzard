  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT\n- Meteorologist: No snow, no freezing rain, no accumulation, typical cold/breezy winter day.\n- Historian: Days like this (dry, mid-20s to low 30s, no storm) almost never close schools; historical snow day rates ~1–3%.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads largely dry with some patchy refreeze/black ice and mist; advises standard precautions but supports a normal on-time start.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closures posted; TV closing boards empty; no strong social/media buzz about an imminent snow day.\n=> All four agree there is no strong trigger for closure and that operation as usual is expected.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\nThere is no substantive conflict in the analyses. The only slightly higher concern is the safety analyst’s “moderate” risk label due to black ice potential and mist around 5–9 AM, but even that analysis concludes conditions are compatible with a normal on-time start, not a delay or snow day.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Snowfall: 0\" forecast from midnight through school start and beyond.\n- That means there is effectively no plow timing constraint related to new accumulation. Crews are maintaining surfaces and treating slick spots, not digging out from a storm.\n- Hours from “snow end” to first bell: effectively infinite, because no storm is occurring. By Michigan standards, that strongly favors school remaining open.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Temps: mid-20s°F pre-dawn, rising toward ~31°F afternoon; all below freezing during the main commute.\n- Meteorologist: no active freezing rain or drizzle; only mist/fog at times.\n- Safety: labels ice formation risk as “moderate” specifically for refreeze/black ice on untreated surfaces, bridges, and shaded secondaries.\n- This is a localized, patchy hazard typical of winter operations, not a county-wide ice storm. It warrants salting and caution, but does not reach the “ice changes everything” threshold used for widespread closures.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- FOX 17 closings list: empty for West Michigan; no active closures or delays.\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): no advance closure or remote-learning posts for Dec. 16.\n- News intel summary: No county-wide hazard signals; typical coordination among superintendents would have produced visible early signals if a major event were expected.\n=> 3+ neighboring districts closed condition is not met, so there is NO upward adjustment from regional domino effects.\n\n6. HOW I COULD BE WRONG\n- A surprise overnight event: unmodeled band of lake-effect snow or freezing drizzle forming after these analyses, creating slick roads and visibility problems by 4–7 AM.\n- Forecast bust on mist/fog: if mist becomes dense freezing fog with widespread glazing, risk could shift toward delay or localized closures.\n- A serious accident cluster early in the morning could drive a reactive closure despite overall marginal conditions.\nGiven current data (timestamp 2025-12-15T14:06Z), these represent low-probability tail risks rather than the base case.\n\n7. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per given weights)\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly signals <5% chance; no storm, no alerts, routine winter cold. I anchor near 3–4% from this piece alone.\n- Safety (25%): Moderate black-ice risk but explicitly supports normal start. This nudges probability slightly upward from a pure-meteorology baseline but still clearly in the single digits.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs give ~1–3% closure rate on days like this; this pulls the estimate a bit lower, toward the bottom of the single-digit range.\n- News/Intel (20% – secret weapon): No closures on boards, no neighboring districts signaling trouble, no strong community buzz. This reinforces that administrators are not treating this as a significant event. That supports staying near the very low end.\n\n8. MICHIGAN-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS\n- Snow totals: 0\" (well below the <4\" → 5–15% category; effectively an even lower tier).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no 8\"+ event, no extreme wind chills.\n- By the provided rubric, this setup justifies a probability clearly below the lowest 5–15% band.\n\nCombining all of this, I set the final snow day probability at 3% with high confidence: extremely likely that Rockford Public Schools operates on time and in person on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, while acknowledging a small residual risk from unforeseen overnight developments.",
