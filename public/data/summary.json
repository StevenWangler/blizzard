    "Primary hazard is light freezing rain/drizzle/black-ice potential (tiny amounts but high impact in extreme cold), not snowfall (near-zero)",
    "Wind chill uncertainty: one high-profile source (Weather.com hourly) shows -25°F to -26°F during 6–8 AM, while WeatherAPI is much warmer; if district uses a hard wind-chill cutoff, odds rise",
    "Plow timing: ~6 hours from precip end (~12:30 AM) to bus time (~6:30 AM) is usually enough for main roads, but extreme cold reduces salt effectiveness; spot ice likely persists on secondary/local roads, bridges, hills",
    "Ground-truth operational signals are weak for a closure: no confirmed Rockford or nearby-district Fri 1/30 closure/delay announcements; no outage event; no strong community road-chatter"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis (weighted):\n1) Agreement across experts: Snow accumulation is negligible; the real risk is a thin glaze/black ice after midnight plus extreme cold. Most experts lean “open / maybe delay,” not a classic snow day.\n2) Disagreements: Wind chill is the key conflict. WeatherAPI suggests sub -20°F is NOT met near start time, but Web Verifier confirms Weather.com hourly shows -25°F to -26°F at 6–8 AM. NWS point confirmation wasn’t obtainable in-session, so this remains unresolved → lowers confidence and keeps probability from dropping too low.\n3) Plow timing math: precip/icing ends ~12:30 AM → ~6.0 hours until 6:30 AM bus time and ~7.2 hours until ~7:40 AM start. That generally favors OPEN, but extreme cold reduces salt performance; infrastructure expects primary roads serviceable but secondary/local roads patchy/slick at daybreak.\n4) Ice? Yes, at least a credible light freezing rain/drizzle signal. Even 0.01\" liquid can create high-impact black ice in subzero air temps.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 1/30 closures/delays found. Earlier-week closures/delays exist but are not strong same-day signals → no +15–20% bump.\n6) Power: Outages are minimal (17 customers; 99.99% with power). No evidence of school-feeder outages → no meaningful bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: Weather.com hourly alone clearly crosses ≤ -20°F during bus time; other available sources are closer to -18 to -25 regionally but not point-confirmed. Because only one point-verified source crosses the hard threshold, I do not treat this as a near-automatic closure; I treat it as a material tail risk.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) If wind chills really are in the -20s at 6–8 AM and the district enforces a hard cutoff, closure odds jump sharply; (b) If a thin glaze is more widespread than expected on secondary roads/bridges/hills, buses may not safely run (delay/closure).\n\nWeighting used (per directive): Meteorology 25% (low snow, light icing), Safety 25% (moderate risk on secondaries), History 15% (glaze more often delay than closure), News 15% (no current closure signals), Infrastructure 10% (serviceable primaries by 6:15–6:30; patchy local roads), Power 5% (minimal outages), Web verifier 5% (flags sub -20°F risk but conflicting). Net: closure probability settles in the high-20s (borderline mainly due to ice + wind-chill uncertainty), with DELAY more likely than FULL CLOSURE if problems verify.",
