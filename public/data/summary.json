  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Agreements:\n  • All four streams (meteorology, history, safety, news) agree this is a light event by Michigan standards with limited accumulation (~0.5–0.75\", maybe up to ~1–2\" at most).\n  • Timing consensus: little to no new precip during the 5–8 AM bus window; main burst and worst visibility 9 AM–noon; lingering lighter snow and slush early afternoon.\n  • Temperatures: mid‑20s°F pre‑dawn, nudging to low 30s°F midday – cold but not extreme.\n  • Risk characterization: nuisance/light snow plus some blowing snow and brief whiteouts, not a major storm or blizzard. Ice present only as localized slick/slushy patches, not a systemic ice storm.\n  • Operational expectation: school can and should run with caution, not a full closure.\n- Disagreements:\n  • Safety calls afternoon impact “significant” while meteorology/history frame the event as low‑end/nuisance. This is more language than substance: they still rate roads 7–8/10 and explicitly recommend holding school.\n  • Community sentiment is “uncertain” (neither strongly expecting closure nor dismissing the event), but this doesn’t conflict with the objective risk – it just means no strong social push either way.\n  → No hard conflicts requiring tool correction; all point to low closure likelihood.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Snow overnight: ~0\" (5% overnight snow chance); roads can be cleared and treated from prior days with no new accumulation before dawn.\n- Morning bus window: ~5:00–8:00 AM – forecast dry/very light precip, temps in mid‑20s°F, road scores high (7–8/10). Plows and salt have had many hours prior to the bus window with no fresh snow.\n- Main burst: ~9:00 AM–1:00 PM; this makes mid‑day/afternoon handling (spot plow passes, salting) the key, not overnight catch‑up.\n- End of worse conditions vs. dismissal: if worst ends ~1 PM and dismissal ~2:30–3:00 PM, there are 1.5–3 hours for roads/parking lots to be treated. With only around an inch or so of total snow and temps near 30–33°F, that is ample time for West Michigan operations.\n→ Plow timing strongly favors keeping school open; no shortfall window before buses.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Temps spend the entire event near or below freezing but slightly above freezing midday (30–33°F). That produces slush and slick spots, especially on untreated surfaces and shaded/rural roads.\n- Critical point: no freezing rain or rain‑to‑freeze transition; precip type is snow only.\n- Safety analyst flags ice risk as “moderate,” consistent with patchy icy/slushy spots rather than sheet ice.\n→ In Michigan terms this is routine winter slipperiness, not a closure‑level ice event.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news intelligence\n- Fox 17 closings: no active school closings or delays (including Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n- RPS official channels: no inclement‑weather alerts, no planned e‑learning, and calendar shows a normal day on Dec 9.\n- Kent County operations: normal meetings; no weather emergency pattern.\n- Community intel: no widespread road shutdowns, no significant event cancellations, no power issues.\n→ There is zero sign of a domino‑effect closure wave; News Intelligence therefore pushes probability down toward the low end of historical analog ranges.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\nUsing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Low‑impact light snow, 0.5–0.75\" expected, main burst after buses. On meteorology alone I’d put closure odds around 5–10%.\n- Safety (25%): Road and walking scores 6–8/10, recommends school on time with caution for midday and dismissal. Safety alone suggests roughly 5–15% closure odds, mostly to cover surprise banding or localized issues.\n- History (20%): Analog snow‑day rates 3–8% for similar setups; strong bias toward school remaining open. This anchors the probability in the single‑digits to low‑teens at most.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closures, no alerts, no emergency tone, community in wait‑and‑see mode. This argues against any pre‑announced closure and trims the probability, especially below Michigan’s typical thresholds.\nBlending these, the weighted consensus centers very near 8–10%. Given the directive to avoid 40–60% unless truly conflicted, and the very consistent low‑risk signal, I select **8%** as the final probability.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds applied\n- Snow amount: <1\" forecast, maybe 1–2\" if everything overperforms – firmly in the “<4\" snow = 5–15%” band, and that band is already generous.\n- No blizzard/ice storm: winds are gusty but not extreme, and we lack sustained very low visibility or ice accretion.\n- No neighboring closures: therefore no +15–20% adjustment; if anything, it supports the lower half of the 5–15% band.\n→ Within the 5–15% guidance, the convergence of all evidence justifies sitting near the lower-middle, around 8%.\n\n7. What could make this prediction wrong?\nUpside risk to closure probability would come from:\n- A surprise heavy band setting up before dawn, dropping 3–5\" by 6–7 AM with continuing snow; this would break the low-accumulation assumption.\n- A last‑minute change to mixed precip, creating unexpected freezing drizzle/ice glaze on top of cold pavement.\n- Multiple neighboring districts deciding on early morning closures based on more pessimistic, hyper‑local observations (e.g., rural north/east routes blowing in more than expected).\nDownside risk (probability actually closer to 0–3%) would occur if:\n- The main mid‑morning band underperforms and produces only flurries/light snow with little visibility degradation.\nGiven the forecast details and current signals, these are real but low‑likelihood deviations, keeping the final call at **8% with high confidence** that school will be open.\n\nConclusion: Conditions are consistent with a standard winter school day in West Michigan, perhaps slower travel and some afternoon sloppiness, but well short of Rockford’s usual closure triggers. A full snow day is unlikely; at most, schools may consider extra caution messaging or, if reality differ significantly from forecast, a same‑day early dismissal rather than a preemptive cancellation.",
