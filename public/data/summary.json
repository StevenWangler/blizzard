    "Primary hazard is localized: patchy fog/low stratus reducing visibility and isolated black ice on bridges/shaded/rural roads",
    "Infrastructure assessment indicates roads/parking lots are already clear; no active plow response needed absent new precip",

  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs point to a classic West Michigan “non-event” for snow-day purposes: no new snow/ice, modest winds, and temperatures in a normal February range for Rockford. The web-verifier did find cross-source temperature differences (WeatherAPI vs TWN vs Weather.com snippet), but importantly none of the checked sources show wind chill/feels-like ≤ -20°F during the 6–8 AM bus window, so the automatic extreme-cold closure rule is not triggered. Safety/infrastructure concerns are localized rather than districtwide: patchy fog/low stratus could reduce visibility and any leftover moisture could refreeze into isolated black ice on bridges, shaded curves, and some rural/subdivision roads. That profile historically produces “open with caution,” occasionally a 2-hour delay if morning road checks find widespread slickness—but it rarely produces a full closure in Rockford/Kent County without active precip or extreme cold. \n\nSecond-order decision effects also lean against a closure: news intelligence found no Feb 2 closure/delay announcements for Rockford or nearby districts (Forest Hills, Northview, Sparta, Cedar Springs, GRPS), and community sentiment shows no buzz. Power-grid conditions are normal with only scattered outages, making an outage-forced closure unlikely.\n\nRecommendation: OPEN with monitoring (and be prepared for a last-minute 2-hour delay only if early Monday road checks confirm widespread black ice or dense fog with very low visibility on key bus routes).",
