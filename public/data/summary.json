    "No accumulating snow expected during the 5–9 AM commute window (primary closure driver absent in Michigan)",
    "No ice/freezing rain signal during bus hours; only a tiny late-evening freezing-rain hint (~11 PM) that would matter more for Wednesday",
    "Temperatures/wind chills during 6–8 AM are far above extreme-cold closure thresholds (no ≤-20°F trigger)",
    "Localized hazard only: patchy freezing fog/black ice potential + a modeled ~1-mile visibility dip around 6–7 AM",
    "No domino effect: no verified neighboring district closures/delays or Rockford PS messaging indicating an impending weather decision; power outages appear minimal and not Rockford-specific"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts align on an ‘in-session’ Tuesday for Rockford: meteorology shows essentially zero morning precipitation and zero snowfall accumulation; wind chills are not remotely near Michigan’s closure thresholds; infrastructure expectation is that main roads are already clear with only spot treatment needed; power-grid conditions do not indicate a disruption-driven closure; and news intelligence found no verified Rockford/neighboring district closure cascade or official hints for Feb 10. The only legitimate risk is localized (not district-wide): possible freezing fog/patchy black ice on bridges and untreated residential roads plus a brief modeled ~1-mile visibility dip near daybreak. Those conditions can justify extra caution or, at most, a limited 2-hour delay if they verify more widespread than expected—but historically they do not usually produce a full closure in West Michigan without an actual icing precipitation event or widespread untreated-surface glaze. Therefore, the optimal Brier-score stance is a low single-digit closure probability, acknowledging a small chance of a delay-type decision if morning spot checks look worse than forecast.",
