  "decision_rationale": "All experts largely agree this is not a classic Michigan closure setup: no snow, no freezing rain signal, light winds, and no extreme wind chill (web verifier found no ≤ -20°F bus-hour wind chills; Weather.com is warmer than the API but both are above closure thresholds). The only meaningful operational risk is a narrow 5–9 AM window of patchy black ice from residual moisture/refreeze plus mist/low clouds—typically a *delay* or “open but cautious” scenario, not a full closure, especially with Kent County’s normal treatment capacity and clear state/county roads. News intelligence also shows no confirmed domino-effect closures yet (FOX 17 closings page showed none active at check time). Power-outage risk is low given very low systemwide outages (127 customers) and no wind/ice load risk overnight. Net: closure is possible only if a surprise glaze develops broadly across secondary roads and multiple early-morning slide-offs occur; otherwise schools should operate normally with enhanced spot-treatment and caution messaging.",
