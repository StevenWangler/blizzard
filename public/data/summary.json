  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs align on a non-snow, above-freezing rain morning for Rockford with rising temperatures during bus hours and no extreme cold. That combination almost never produces a full closure in West Michigan because roads remain generally passable and there is no plowing/accumulation problem. The only credible operational risks are (1) reduced visibility from fog/low stratus in the 6–9 AM window and (2) isolated slick spots on bridges/untreated surfaces if pavement temperatures lag air temperatures near dawn. However, the infrastructure view indicates roads are already clear (monitor/spot-treat mode), the power-grid view shows no evidence of a significant outage event, and the news intel check found no active closings/delays on a major local list and no Rockford PS disruption messaging—removing the ‘domino effect’ pressure. \n\nThere is a mild internal tension: Safety labels ice-formation risk as “moderate,” but did not provide confirming evidence of subfreezing pavement temperatures; given the air-temperature forecast (upper 30s to low 40s during 6–9 AM) and steady rain, widespread ice is unlikely. I therefore weight the ice risk as a low-probability tail, keeping closure probability low but non-zero. Net: expect OPEN, with a more plausible 2-hour delay than a full closure if dense fog (<1/4 mile) is observed on key routes right before decision time.",
