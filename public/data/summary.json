  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear consensus that Friday is cold and dry with **0.0\" new snow and 0% precip** during school hours. Winds are breezy but not extreme; wind chills uncomfortable but not at Michigan closure criteria.\n- History (20%): Strong analog match to typical **post-storm, cold, dry days**. Historical snow-day rates for similar setups are 1–3%. This firmly supports **school in session**.\n- Safety (25%): Rates primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, lots 8/10. Notes **moderate refreeze/black ice risk** early, but explicitly concludes that conditions **support opening on time**; any risk is handled with salting and routine winter caution.\n- News/Community Intel (20%): Confirms statewide messaging about a **flash-freeze and some lake-effect**, but Rockford is on the **edge of the higher-impact belt** with light accumulations and mainly ice concerns. Crucially, there are **no Rockford or Kent ISD closure announcements** and no strong local “we’re definitely closing” buzz. Neighboring calendar days off are non-weather-related.\n\nAll four lines of evidence agree on: **no active storm over Rockford during the commute, modest but manageable icing risk, and a low base-rate for closures in this setup.** There are no serious conflicts—only tone differences (statewide media emphasizing risk vs. local data showing Rockford on the lighter-impact side).\n\n2. Plow/road-timing math\n- Any rain/sleet ends before or around midnight, with temps then dropping below freezing.\n- The worst refreeze/ice window is **roughly 2–8 AM**, overlapping the bus/commute time.\n- With **no new snow to move**, road crews focus on **salting**. By first bus runs (~6–7 AM), crews have had several hours to respond to icing.\n- By the first bell (~7:40–8:00 AM), salt plus traffic typically improves main and many secondary routes, leaving only isolated slick spots.\nThis timing favors **slower but feasible travel**, not widespread impassability.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: No new freezing rain or snow Friday; freeze comes from **leftover moisture**.\n- Safety: Labels ice risk as **moderate**, warns of black ice on bridges/untreated roads, but still supports a normal start.\n- News intel: NWS and TV outlets emphasize flash-freeze risk statewide, but note Rockford’s area should see **light snow and mainly icy patches**, not an ice storm.\nThere is **some ice risk, but not an ice storm** or widespread glaze severe enough to typically trigger a snow day in Kent County.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior\n- No Kent ISD neighbors are closing for weather; Cedar Springs is off for **scheduled winter break**, not conditions.\n- No regional closure wave, no multiple neighboring districts closed → per your rules, **no upward adjustment** from this factor.\n\n5. Weighting the experts\n- Starting from the meteorological and historical base rate: post-storm dry/cold days with some refreeze historically yield ~1–3% closure odds. I treat this combined base as ~5% to reflect slightly elevated concern from the flash-freeze discussion.\n- Safety (25% weight) confirms manageable risks with a normal start → keep probability near this low base, perhaps nudging to ~7–8% to reflect the moderate commuting concern.\n- News intel (20%) adds statewide chatter about higher closure odds elsewhere, but **not locally in Rockford** and with no neighbor closures. That warrants only a small additional bump (community uncertainty and flash-freeze emphasis), bringing the final figure to **9%**.\n\n6. Why not higher (15–40%)?\n- Michigan thresholds you provided emphasize **active snow/ice events** or substantial accumulations. Here we have **0\" new snow, no freezing rain during school hours, and no blizzard/ice storm headlines**.\n- Local historical closure behavior is strongly against closing simply for patchy ice when crews are prepared.\n- No 3+ neighboring districts are closing for weather, so we don’t apply the +15–20% bump.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Underestimation of ice: If temperatures fall a few degrees faster or lower than modeled and road treatment is delayed/ineffective, black ice could be **more widespread than expected**, prompting last-minute closures or delays.\n- Localized lake-effect band: If a stronger-than-forecast band sets up directly over Rockford during the pre-dawn hours, adding a quick 1–2\" of snow plus ice, conditions could degrade enough for a closure.\n- Operational/administrative choices: If Rockford’s transportation team, on early-morning checks, finds unusually bad rural routes or several accidents, they might choose a delay/closure even without heavy precip.\nGiven current data, these are **plausible but low-probability** deviations, so the forecast remains in single digits with **high confidence**.\n\nFinal call: **Snow day probability ≈ 9%** — strongly favoring a **normal, on-time school day** with heightened caution for early-morning icing on untreated roads and sidewalks.",
