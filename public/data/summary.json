    "Trace freezing rain/freezing drizzle risk roughly 1:30–4:00 AM with subfreezing temps afterward → potential for patchy black ice on bridges, hills, rural connectors, and subdivision streets",
    "Michigan plow/salt capacity and timing: ~4.5 hours from worst icing window to bus routes, with at least one treatment cycle likely on priority roads; locals may remain patchy",
    "No accumulating snow expected in the point forecast (base meteorology strongly favors staying open)",
    "News intelligence conflict/behavioral signal: FOX 17 is explicitly listing Rockford Public Schools (and Forest Hills) as “closed Wednesday,” even though district-official postings weren’t found in the retrieved pages—this raises closure odds via domino/announcement effects",
    "Power grid not a primary driver (systemwide outages still low, no confirmed Rockford cluster) and wind chills are in the teens (not near extreme-cold closure thresholds)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Meteorology/infrastructure/history/safety all align on a typical Michigan ‘non-snow’ event with a narrow, trace freezing-rain window overnight. By itself, that setup usually produces either an on-time open or, if morning spot checks show widespread glazing on secondary roads, a 1–2 hour delay—not a full closure. The main reason the closure probability is higher than the expert-average (~9%) is the news intelligence signal: FOX 17 is actively running a ‘Wednesday closures’ cycle and explicitly lists Rockford Public Schools as closed (and Forest Hills as closed). That is a strong behavioral indicator if it is current and date-correct, but it conflicts with (a) the district website not showing an official notice in retrieved pages and (b) the quiet point forecast. To optimize for real-world decision-making (and Brier score) under this conflict, I’m moving from single-digit closure odds to a low-but-meaningful 22%: still more likely OPEN than CLOSED, but acknowledging (1) a black-ice surprise can push administrators conservative, and (2) if a major TV closings list is already showing Rockford as closed for Wednesday, the operational outcome may already be decided regardless of the light-precip forecast. No extreme cold trigger exists (no source shows ≤ -20°F wind chills during 6–8 AM), and power outages appear too limited/systemwide to force closure.",
