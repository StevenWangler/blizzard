    "Low snowfall total (~0.9\") is well below typical Michigan closure thresholds",

  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement across experts: All four converge on a mostly dry 6–9 AM commute with light overnight snow (<1\") and the main hazard being patchy refreeze/black ice from a brief ~3 AM icing signal plus falling temps. All note evening deterioration is more impactful than the morning.\n2) Disagreements: The only real tension is how much weight to give the freezing-rain flag and a few suspect ‘0 mi visibility’ hours. Meteorology cross-check indicates the freezing rain is trace-QPF and the 0-visibility midday values look like data artifacts, so escalation for closure is not supported.\n3) Plow timing math: Worst precip ends ~04:00. From 04:00 to a ~07:40 start is ~3 hours 40 minutes—generally sufficient for Michigan overnight operations to clear/treat primary routes. Secondary/neighborhood roads can still have patchy slick spots.\n4) Any ice? Yes, but likely TRACE glaze/black-ice risk rather than an accreting ice event. That raises delay risk slightly, but not enough for a high closure probability absent widespread reports.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed closures/delays found for nearby districts in the news-intel pull; weak ‘planned open’ signals via calendars/events.\n6) What would make me wrong? If the ~03:00 freezing rain is more than trace (or a flash-freeze occurs on pre-wet pavement) leading to widespread slick secondary roads at 06:00–08:00, or if an unexpected lake-effect band shifts into Rockford during 05:00–08:00 causing rapid accumulation/visibility collapse.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly favors OPEN; snow total ~0.9\", AM dry; icing risk trace → low closure.\n- Safety (25%): Moderate residual slick-spot risk; supports normal start with contingency for 1–2 hr delay if route checks find widespread glaze.\n- History (20%): Similar patterns historically yield ~12–22% snow-day rates; late-Jan Michigan tolerance pulls probability down.\n- News intel (20%): No neighboring closures; no strong community “expect closure” signal → no upward adjustment.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds (<4\" typically 5–15%) but adding some lift for trace ice + refreeze + very cold start, I land at 18% (still decisively ‘unlikely’).",
