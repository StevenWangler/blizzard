  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs conflict:\n- Meteorology: Classic cold and quiet winter day. No new precipitation, no snow during any school-related window, winds light, wind chills single digits above zero, roads frozen but dry, no alerts. Strongly implies normal operations.\n- History: Multiple close analogs (cold, dry, early December, no storm) show a 0% historical snow-day rate. Notes Rockford rarely closes for anything less than several inches of new snow, widespread ice, or extreme wind chills near or below -15°F. Assesses the specific date as essentially a near-0% closure situation.\n- Safety: Road/sidewalk scores are high (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, walking 7/10). Risk level explicitly labeled \"low.\" Notes only some residual compacted snow/ice from Sunday that standard salting and plowing easily handle. Commute impacts morning and afternoon both labeled \"minimal.\"\n- News/Intel: No districts on TV closing lists, no official announcements, no neighboring closures, no community chatter, no power or road emergencies; pattern is described as typical early-winter cold with no major storm.\n\nAll four experts independently converge on: no storm, typical Michigan winter cold, good road conditions, and an expectation of normal school operations. There are no substantive conflicts—only minor nuance about some residual ice risk on untreated spots.\n\n2. Plow timing math:\n- Sunday had light freezing rain/snow, but Monday itself is dry with 0% precip overnight.\n- With no new snow between midnight and the 7:40 AM start time, plow/salt crews have all night (8–10+ hours) to address any remaining slick spots.\n- Safety explicitly rates primary and secondary roads at 9 and 8 out of 10, which implicitly confirms plow/salt work is sufficient long before buses roll.\n- Effective \"time from last meaningful precip to school start\" is many hours, easily satisfying Michigan norms for safe operations.\n\n3. Ice assessment:\n- Sunday: light freezing rain/snow created some residual slick patches.\n- Monday forecast: completely dry, temps in teens keep any leftover moisture frozen, but that is routine for December.\n- Safety calls the *ice formation risk* \"moderate\" on micro-scales (bridges, shaded side streets), yet still assigns high driving and road scores and a low overall risk level. No indication of widespread glaze ice or new freezing drizzle.\n- Meteorology: no signal for new freezing rain or any precip; just cold, dry conditions.\n\nConclusion: There may be localized icy spots that warrant caution and salting, but not the kind of broad, hazardous ice event that drives system-wide closures. Under the given thresholds, this falls far below an \"ice changes everything\" scenario.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals:\n- News intel confirms: no neighboring closures (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) listed for Monday.\n- No early dismissals or special patterns flagged.\n- Social/media sentiment: \"no_buzz\" about school being canceled; community appears to expect a standard school day.\n- Per the weighting rules, we would only bump probabilities up if multiple neighboring districts were closing or if community chatter strongly expected closure. Here, we have the opposite: no closures and quiet sentiment, supporting a very low probability.\n\n5. Applying Michigan-specific thresholds and expert weights:\n- Snow amount: 0\" new snow (well below even the <4\" category that already only implies 5–15% in Michigan).\n- Ice: only residual, localized slick spots from the prior day, with clear road-treatment capacity. No ongoing icing event, no alerts.\n- Cold: teens with single-digit-above-zero wind chills—far from the -15°F to -20°F closures thresholds.\n- Wind/visibility: light wind, generally good visibility; no lake-effect bands or storm system.\n\nWeighted synthesis:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors school open, near 0% closure.\n- Safety (25%): Rates risk \"low\" with minimal commute impact; effectively a near-0–3% closure likelihood.\n- History (20%): Analog snow-day rate ~0%; past behavior in similar conditions is to stay open.\n- News/Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no buzz, no issues; consistent with very low odds.\n\nAll four pillars line up in the same direction, with no compensating factor that would justify even a moderate probability. Michigan tolerance for winter weather is high, and none of the big triggers (6+ inches, active storm, widespread ice, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold) come close to being met.\n\n6. Probability choice and Brier thinking:\n- Given the near-total agreement and historical base rate, a 1% probability appropriately reflects: (a) there is always a tiny chance of an unexpected administrative decision or hyper-local issue, but (b) using something like 5–10% would overstate risk relative to both history and current signals.\n- A 0% forecast could score poorly if a freak administrative choice occurred; 1% keeps the forecast honest while still being decisively in the \"school will be open\" regime.\n\nTherefore, the best calibrated final forecast for Rockford, MI on Monday, 2025-12-08 is a snow-day probability of about 1%, with very high confidence that school will operate normally.",
