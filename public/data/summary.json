    "No new snow/ice expected Thu morning (0\" forecast) with good visibility and light winds—classic ‘cleanup day’ setup",
    "Temps in the teens can refreeze leftover moisture, creating patchy black ice risk 5–9 AM (bridges, shaded rural/secondary roads, neighborhoods)",
    "No extreme-cold trigger: wind chills stay well above the ≤-20°F automatic-closure threshold",
    "No domino effect signal: FOX 17 closings page shows no active closings/delays; Rockford Public Schools has posted no Thu 2/26 closure/delay notice",
    "Power grid appears stable system-wide (few outages reported), with low likelihood of weather-driven new outages on Thu (dry/light wind)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All core experts align on the main point: Thursday is not an active winter-storm day for Rockford—no accumulating snow is forecast, winds are modest, and visibility is good. The only credible disruption mechanism is residual moisture from Wednesday’s light snow/freezing-rain episodes refreezing overnight into patchy black ice, especially on bridges/overpasses and lower-volume neighborhood/rural roads.\n\nI challenged the low-probability consensus by looking for ‘tie-breaker’ signals that often push Michigan districts into a closure despite quiet weather: (1) extreme wind chill ≤ -20°F (not present in any captured source), (2) widespread icing/freezing rain during bus hours (not supported by the provided Thu hourly forecast), (3) confirmed neighboring-district closures (none verified; FOX 17 shows no active closings), and (4) material power outages (system-wide outages are small; no verified Rockford cluster). The Kent County Road Commission preparation story supports heightened slick-spot vigilance, but it is consistent with a targeted spot-treat response—not a closure trigger by itself.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for full closures, the most likely outcome is OPEN with a cautious message. A short delay is the more plausible “upside risk” than a full snow day if early-morning spot checks find unexpectedly widespread glaze on secondary/bus-route trouble areas. Net: 6% closure probability optimizes for Brier score—low, but not zero—reflecting the real (though usually localized) black-ice surprise pathway.",
