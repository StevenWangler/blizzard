  "decision_rationale": "All expert inputs align on a non-snow, above-freezing morning with fog as the main operational issue. Meteorology and web verification both show mid-30s temperatures and feels-like around ~29–32°F during 6–9 AM, with 0\" snow and no extreme cold—so Michigan’s main closure triggers (ice storm, blizzard/heavy snow, or ≤-20°F wind chill) are not present. Safety and infrastructure agree the credible hazard is reduced visibility during the bus window, plus isolated slick spots on bridges/overpasses if microclimates briefly touch ~32°F; that profile more often produces slower routes or, at most, a short delay rather than a full closure. News intelligence shows no active closings/delays on a local TV closings page at this time and no confirmed neighboring-district weather closures; additionally, several nearby districts being off for mid-winter break weakens any ‘domino’ closure signal. Power-grid risk is low: only scattered outages countywide, not a widespread event. Given Michigan’s high bar for full closures and the lack of snow/ice/extreme cold, the best Brier-optimized call is a low single-digit closure probability, with monitoring for localized dense fog/spot-ice that could instead justify a delay.",
