    "No accumulating snow/precipitation expected; light winds and temps in the low–mid 20s favor normal operations in Michigan",
    "Only credible operational hazard is patchy dense/freezing fog + refreeze/black ice risk near daybreak (visibility fields show near-zero for several pre-dawn hours)",
    "No confirmed closure/delay cascade from neighboring districts; Rockford PS has no closure signal posted",
    "Road agencies likely in spot-treatment mode (no storm response), so isolated slick bridges/rural connectors remain the main risk",
    "Power-grid risk appears low (small statewide outage count; no wind/ice to drive new outages)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts agree there is no snow system to force a closure: forecast snowfall is 0, winds are light, and wind chill is nowhere near Michigan extreme-cold thresholds. Historically, these “cold/dry” days almost always operate normally. The only meaningful closure pathway is a localized hazard: dense/freezing fog and overnight refreeze producing reduced visibility and patchy black ice (especially bridges, low spots, and rural bus routes). Safety clarified that the forecast’s lowest-visibility window overlaps the Thu morning bus period, but this kind of hazard in West Michigan typically leads to heightened caution or a 2-hour delay in select cases—not a full closure—unless there are widespread verified road issues at 5–6 AM. News intelligence found no confirmed neighboring-district closure domino effect and no Rockford closure messaging, which further supports staying open. Power-outage-driven closure risk is also low given calm weather and only small, scattered statewide outages.\n\nRecommendation: OPEN with monitoring; be prepared to pivot to a 2-hour delay only if dense fog + widespread slick-spot reports materialize on early route checks.",
