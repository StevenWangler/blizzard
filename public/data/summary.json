    "Most-likely snow totals are modest for Michigan (~1.5–2\" by mid-morning; ~25% chance of >3\"), which usually is manageable without a closure",
    "Key risk is a pre-dawn freezing rain/drizzle window (~3–5 AM) with temps in the mid-teens; even a trace–0.01\" glaze can create black-ice conditions on bridges/secondary roads",
    "Worst travel window overlaps bus/arrival times (roughly 6:00–8:30 AM) with visibility occasionally ~1 mile and a potential moderate snow burst near ~8 AM",
    "Plow timing math is unfavorable for a normal start: ‘worst conditions’ extend to ~08:30, which is after a 7:40 AM first bell (0 hours recovery)",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays or strong community “expecting closure” signals at the time of the intel pull (reduces the chance of a full snow day)"

  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) AGREEMENT across experts:\n- All four inputs flag the morning commute as the main problem window.\n- All agree snow totals alone are not a classic Michigan closure trigger, but timing + visibility + any ice can elevate risk.\n- Winds are modest (not a blizzard/drifting-driven closure).\n\n2) DISAGREEMENTS / conflicts:\n- Amounts: Meteorology model guidance suggests ~1.4–1.8\" most likely (with banding risk), while news messaging cites a broader 2–5\" advisory-style headline. The meteorologist clarified that the 2–5\" is likely regional/upper-end or longer-duration, and Rockford’s 1–9 AM most-likely is ~1–2.5\" with a ~25% chance of >3\".\n- Outcome: Safety flags HIGH operational risk (ice + timing). History and baseline Michigan thresholds argue against a full closure unless measurable glaze or heavier rates materialize.\n\n3) Plow timing math (critical):\n- Safety analyst: worst conditions end ~08:30.\n- If first bell is ~07:40, recovery time is effectively negative (08:30 is ~50 minutes after first bell). This strongly favors a DELAY over a normal start.\n\n4) Ice?\n- Yes, at least a credible risk. Meteorologist estimates ~30% chance of >0.01\" glaze; even a trace can be high impact at mid-teen temps. Safety assessment calls ice-formation risk HIGH.\n\n5) Neighboring districts?\n- News intel could NOT confirm any posted closures/delays for Wed 01/21 for nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Lowell, Sparta, Kentwood, GRPS) in the accessible sources, and found no strong community buzz. That removes a major upward adjustment that would otherwise push toward closure.\n\n6) What would make this prediction WRONG?\n- If freezing rain is more than a trace (widespread measurable glaze) OR the 8 AM burst persists/bands producing >3–4\" by early morning, the probability of a full closure jumps sharply.\n- Conversely, if the icing window does not occur and snow remains light/scattered with better-than-expected visibility, schools likely run (possibly even without a delay).\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Points to modest totals but meaningful ice/visibility timing risk; supports delay/limited disruption more than closure.\n- Safety (25%): Strongly argues morning operations are impacted with no recovery time by 7:40; supports delay.\n- History (20%): Similar patterns in Kent County more often produce delays than full closures unless there’s measurable glaze/heavier rates.\n- News Intel (20%): No confirmed neighboring closures and no strong community expectation signal → keeps full-closure odds down.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nGiven Michigan thresholds, modest accumulation, but a high-impact timing/ice risk with no pre-bell recovery time, I land on a LOWER-END snow-day (full closure) probability and a higher likelihood of a 2-hour delay. The 28% reflects “closure is possible if ice verifies or banding overperforms,” but it is not the most likely outcome absent confirmed regional closures or higher totals.",
