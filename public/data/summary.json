  "decision_rationale": "Using Michigan-specific thresholds: 8.6\" of snow and a Winter Storm Watch would normally push probabilities high (60–80%) if the heaviest snow aligned with a school commute. Here, the core of the storm is Saturday daytime through late evening, tapering into early Sunday, with sub-freezing temps but manageable winds (10–20 mph, gusts <30 mph) and no extreme cold. That timing is the key: schools are already closed when travel is worst, and road crews plus building/lot crews can work through Sunday.\n\nHistorical analogs in Kent County for weekend-focused 6–9\" events show a snow-day rate closer to 25–35%, not the 60%+ seen when heavy snow hits a weekday morning. Rockford also has a higher bar for closing: typical closures combine heavy snow DURING the commute, whiteout/strong drifting, or dangerous wind chills, which are not present here. \n\nSafety and infrastructure assessments show significant weekend travel impacts and high ice risk, but they explicitly note minimal morning-commute impact and frame Monday as a cleanup/contingency question rather than a likely full closure. Roads may be messy in spots, but primary routes and lots are likely to be serviceable by Monday with standard plowing and salting.\n\nBalancing: (1) strong storm magnitude (pulls probability up), (2) weekend-centric timing and good prep window (pulls down), (3) local tolerance and historical behavior (pulls down), the calibrated outcome is a roughly one-in-three chance that Rockford Public Schools will declare a snow day on the next school day after this storm, with a slightly higher additional chance of a delay. To remain decisive and avoid the 40–60% uncertainty band, the final call is 33%.",
