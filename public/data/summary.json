  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis and weighting (Meteorology 25%, Safety 25%, History 15%, News 15%, Infrastructure 10%, Power 5%, Web verify 5%):\n\n1) Agreement: All experts agree Wed morning is a ‘cleanup/refreeze’ setup with essentially no new accumulating snow during the commute; the main hazard is leftover ice/packed snow from Tue and overnight refreeze, especially on secondary/local roads.\n\n2) Disagreements & resolution: The only potentially high-impact conflict was wind chill. Web verification initially flagged a Weather.com view showing ~-23°F to -24°F, which would strongly push toward closure. Follow-up verification indicates this is likely a page/locale artifact: WeatherAPI + canonical Weather.com + another Weather.com variant cluster around +1°F to +6°F feels-like for 6–8 AM. Therefore, no extreme-cold automatic-closure trigger is supported.\n\n3) Plow timing math: Snow/ice impacts wind down Tue evening, giving ~21 hours to the 6:30 AM bus window. Infrastructure now expects trunklines largely clear and arterials treated by ~06:30, but residential/local streets remain inconsistent. That combination usually supports ‘open’ or a DELAY rather than a full closure.\n\n4) Ice?: Yes—moderate refreeze/black ice risk is the main driver. This pushes probability upward from a pure ‘quiet day’ baseline.\n\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Wed 1/28 closure wave found in the latest accessible scans; this removes a key multiplier that would otherwise add +15–20%.\n\n6) Power outages: Statewide outage count increased (12→187), but Kent County appears near-zero and no Rockford cluster is evident. This is not a closure driver right now.\n\n7) Multi-source wind chill: Best-verified 6–8 AM wind chill is above 0°F and far above the ≤ -20°F threshold.\n\n8) What would make this wrong? If late Tue night observations show widespread glazing/freezing fog on untreated roads (not just isolated spots), or if multiple nearby districts post early-morning closures (domino effect), or if a localized power loss hits key school buildings. Any of those would shift toward a 2-hour delay or, less likely, closure.\n\nNet: With no new snow and no verified extreme wind chill, a full closure remains unlikely, but refreeze + variable neighborhood streets keep it above a ‘routine open’ probability. Final full snow-day (closure) probability: 22%. A 2-hour delay is the more plausible disruption outcome.",
