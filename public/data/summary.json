  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs align that this is not a Michigan-grade snow day setup: there is no meaningful snow/ice accumulation forecast, winds are light, and wind chills are well above the automatic closure thresholds. The only plausible pathway to disruption is a fog/freezing-fog morning (the dataset includes low visibility around ~1 mile and some near-zero hours), which the safety follow-up interprets as more likely patchy/local pockets rather than a districtwide dense fog blanket because winds are not calm and the visibility signal oscillates hour-to-hour. Infrastructure monitoring indicates roads are generally clear with no storm-driven plowing need, and the power grid shows only ~tens of customers out systemwide with low likelihood of weather-driven new outages. News intelligence found no official Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay announcements and no community buzz, which strongly argues against a preemptive closure. \n\nRecommendation: Rockford should plan to OPEN, with transportation doing the standard early route check for fog/bridge slickness and having a conditional 2-hour delay trigger only if widespread ≤0.5 mile visibility and/or confirmed freezing-fog glazing is observed across multiple route quadrants by ~5:30 AM. Given Michigan operational tolerance, full closure remains unlikely; a short delay is the more realistic downside risk.",
