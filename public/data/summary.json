  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement across all four experts:\n- A high-impact morning: accumulating snow starts ~3 AM, worsens 5:30–10:30 AM.\n- Peak snow rates occur during the school commute window (esp. 6–9 AM), with reduced visibility.\n- Temps stay below freezing → little/no melt; secondary roads and lots will be problematic.\n- No clear freezing-rain transition on Wednesday morning; “ice risk” is mainly packed snow/compaction/refreeze.\n\n2) Disagreements:\n- Meteorology/Safety lean toward closure risk because peak intensity overlaps buses; Historian suggests Kent County often opts for a delay rather than full closure at ~8\" without ice.\n- News intel does NOT confirm neighboring-district closures yet (so no +15–20% domino bump), but does show strong hazard context and closure-leaning chatter.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM):\n- Snow does not end before start; heavy snow is indicated beginning ~08:00 and persists into late morning. Catch-up time before buses (~06:30–07:15) is effectively zero; before 7:40 AM is also effectively zero.\n\n4) Any ice?\n- No freezing rain expected Wednesday morning per meteorologist; safety analyst clarifies “moderate” ice risk is from compaction/polishing and possible refreeze, not glaze ice.\n\n5) Neighboring districts?\n- Not confirmed closed/delayed on the surfaced official pages (Rockford, GRPS, Northview, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Greenville). Therefore, I did NOT apply a domino-closure adjustment.\n\n6) What would make me wrong?\n- WRONG-HIGH scenario: If snow rates/visibility are better than forecast at 6–8 AM (e.g., main band arrives later), districts may run a 2-hour delay or even open.\n- WRONG-LOW scenario: If mesoscale banding boosts totals into the 10–12+ inch range OR visibility drops toward near-whiteout on secondary roads during bus runs, a closure becomes more likely than my current probability.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive: Met 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News 20%):\n- Meteorology (35%): 8.1\" with peak ~1.46\"/hr near 8 AM and vis ~1 mi during 6–9 AM strongly supports closure/delay. → high closure pressure.\n- Safety (25%): Severe commute impact, near-zero plow catch-up, secondaries very poor. → high closure pressure.\n- History (20%): For Kent County, this often becomes a 2-hour delay rather than full closure absent ice/blizzard; closure frequency ~15–25% in analogs, but higher when heavy snow persists at decision time (which it does here). → moderates upward but keeps closure from being “slam dunk.”\n- News intel (20%): Strong hazardous-travel context and closure-leaning chatter, but no verified neighboring closures/official postings yet → slight upward nudge, not a full domino bump.\n\nFINAL: Given the peak intensity overlapping buses with essentially no plow catch-up time, I put **closure** slightly more likely than not for Rockford, but with meaningful chance of a **2-hour delay** if roads are marginally passable on primaries and visibility holds closer to ~1 mi (not near-whiteout).",
