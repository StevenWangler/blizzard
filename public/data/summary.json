  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Clearly states that for Tuesday, Dec. 30, conditions are cold, breezy, and manageable with no accumulating snow during the morning commute and only ~0.4\" in the evening. High confidence in a normal school day *if* school were in session.\n- Historian: Finds strong analogs to a classic ‘day after the storm’ with light additional snow and routine winter cold. Historical snow‑day rates in such setups are 3–15%, supporting a low closure probability.\n- Safety analyst: Rates primary and secondary roads 7–8/10 by morning, with minimal morning‑commute impact and only moderate afternoon/evening issues. Recommends a normal start with extra caution.\n- News & community intel: Confirms that Rockford and key neighboring districts (Cedar Springs, Forest Hills) are officially on Winter Break with NO SCHOOL on Dec. 30; no weather‑driven closure decisions are being made because there is no session. Also confirms that Monday’s storm is legitimately rough, but there is no evidence of widespread power outages or infrastructure failure.\n\nAll four experts agree on the core points:\n- The worst weather is Monday into late Monday night; Tuesday morning is a post‑storm, colder, mostly dry window.\n- No significant new snow or ice is expected during the Tuesday morning bus window.\n- Roads should be generally passable by morning with some slick spots.\n- Rockford is not in session on Dec. 30 due to Winter Break.\n\nThere are no substantive conflicts; the only nuance is that news reports emphasize hazardous regional travel Monday–early Tuesday, while meteorology and safety clarify that by the *school‑time* window Tuesday, conditions are improved enough for normal Michigan operations.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions end: ~2025-12-29T23:00-05:00 per safety analysis.\n- Morning school window: ~06:00–08:00 on 2025-12-30.\n- Effective plow window: approx. 23:00–06:00 → about 7 hours for crews to plow, salt, and address drifting.\n- Safety analysis explicitly notes that crews should have primary and most secondary routes in passable condition by 6–7 AM Tuesday.\n\nThis 7‑hour cleanup window is ample for Kent County’s experienced road crews after a storm where Tuesday’s new accumulation is minimal and no new overnight snowfall is predicted. Plow timing is therefore favorable and clearly supports a normal start.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorological analysis: Precipitation type during the late‑Tuesday event is snow only; no additional freezing rain or mixed precip is forecast for Tuesday morning.\n- Temperatures: Upper teens to low 20s F with wind chills near 0–5°F; that supports refreezing of residual moisture but not active icing from new precipitation.\n- Safety analysis: Flags ‘moderate’ ice‑formation risk in the sense of refreeze/black ice on untreated surfaces, bridges, and parking lots—but not a widespread glaze or ice storm.\n\nConclusion: There is **no significant active ice event** Tuesday morning. Hazard is limited to typical black‑ice patches after a storm, which districts in this area routinely manage without canceling school.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Rockford Public Schools: Official calendar marks Dec. 22–31 as Winter Break / NO SCHOOL; Dec. 30 is explicitly labeled ‘NO SCHOOL – Winter Break.’\n- Cedar Springs and Forest Hills: Also on Winter Break Dec. 22–early January, with Dec. 30 explicitly off.\n- Many other Kent ISD districts typically align with this schedule; practical effect is that the entire local cluster is out of session.\n\nBecause the neighboring districts are closed for break—not weather—there is **no active snow‑day domino effect** to incorporate. The News Intelligence weighting (20%) therefore doesn’t produce an upward adjustment for closures, since these are calendar closures, not weather decisions.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (as specified):\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates a low‑impact, post‑storm morning with no new snow, modest wind, and typical cold → baseline snow‑day risk around 5–10%.\n- Safety (25%): Road scores 7–8/10; minimal morning commute impact → supports 5–15% range.\n- History (20%): Analog snow‑day rates between 3–15% for similar setups → pushes toward lower end of Michigan thresholds.\n- News intel (20%): Confirms Winter Break (no operational decision needed) and highlights tough Monday travel but no systemic Tuesday‑morning failure. Since there’s no real‑time ‘neighboring districts closing for weather’ signal, no +15–20% bump is applied.\n\nCombining these:\n- Raw operational probability if school were in session: around 8–12% (consistent with Michigan threshold guidance for <4\" snow and no ice).\n- Because there is, in reality, no school scheduled, the *effective* probability of a declared snow day is very close to 0; however, for competition purposes we treat the question as: “Would there likely be a snow day **if** this were a regular session day?” That yields an estimated **8%** probability.\n\n6. Michigan thresholds alignment\n- Total new snow Tuesday: ~0.4\" (<4\") → baseline 5–15% snow‑day chance.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard during the commute, and wind chills well above extreme‑cold closure thresholds.\n- Strong local capacity for snow/ice management and historical resilience in similar conditions.\n\nThus, an 8% probability is consistent with both the Michigan threshold table and historical analog data.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- If lake‑effect bands unexpectedly regenerate or stall over Rockford between ~3–7 AM, producing several quick inches (4–6\"+) and whiteout conditions right during the bus window, the snow‑day probability would jump significantly into at least the 35–50% range.\n- If power outages or major infrastructure problems emerged overnight in the Rockford area (which are *possible* in Monday’s high winds but not currently reported), that could drive closures for safety reasons even with marginal road conditions.\n- If a last‑minute surge of freezing drizzle or mixed precipitation developed early Tuesday instead of dry conditions, the moderate black‑ice risk could escalate into a more serious ice hazard.\n\nGiven the current expert inputs, these are low‑probability alternative scenarios, which is why the central estimate remains at 8% with high confidence.",
