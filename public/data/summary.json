    "Rockford Public Schools are confirmed CLOSED on Mon 2026-02-16 for scheduled Mid-Winter Break (district website, calendar, superintendent update, and multiple building/program pages corroborate)",
    "No evidence of a weather-driven closure trigger (no accumulating snow forecast; winds light; wind chill not near extreme-cold thresholds)",
    "Some travel risk exists from freezing fog/possible patchy black ice around early morning, but this is operationally moot for the main school-day question because it is already a no-school day",
    "Neighboring “closures” are largely the same scheduled break, so there is no meaningful weather-driven domino-effect signal",
    "Power-grid risk is low (very low, decreasing outage counts; no wind/ice-loading storm signal)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "This decision splits into two interpretations; I’m optimizing for what families/schools practically need to know. Multiple independent, official Rockford Public Schools sources (district homepage reminders, district calendar, district news post, and superintendent update) confirm **no school on Monday 2/16/2026 due to Mid-Winter Break**, with early-childhood/preschool pages also showing closure. That makes the probability of a “snow day / no school” outcome extremely high regardless of weather. \n\nIf the question is narrowly “weather-triggered closure decision,” then the probability would be low (single digits) because the meteorological/safety/infrastructure inputs show **no snow accumulation**, light winds, and only a freezing-fog/patchy black-ice risk that more commonly supports a delay than a full closure in Michigan. But since the district is already scheduled closed district-wide, there is effectively no weather-driven go/no-go decision for regular classes on 2/16.\n\nUncertainty is mainly limited to edge cases (e.g., a separate community-ed/childcare program, athletics, or building activities making their own morning cancellation call), not whether regular school is in session.",
