    "Main roads/bus routes expected passable; only *localized* refreeze/black-ice risk on bridges, shaded rural connectors, and some neighborhood streets",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closure domino signals for Mon 2/23 as of Fri 2/20; Rockford PS has no closure/delay posting",
    "Power-grid risk appears low: only scattered outages indicated systemwide after the Fri wind, unlikely to persist into Monday at disruptive levels"

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, news intel, infrastructure, and power-grid inputs, the base case for Rockford, MI on Mon 2/23 is a normal winter school day: no forecast accumulation, no ice event indicated, modest winds, and wind chills well above the -15°F/-20°F closure triggers. The only meaningful operational risk is *patchy* black ice from residual moisture/refreeze (bridges, shaded stretches, subdivisions), which in West Michigan typically leads to targeted treatment and cautious driving—more often a minor delay at most, not a districtwide closure. News/community signals do not show a closure trend in neighboring districts yet (appropriate this far out), and power-outage risk looks scattered and unlikely to force closure. What could make this wrong is an unmodeled late-Sunday-night band (lake-effect/clipper) or unexpected drizzle/fog deposition creating broader icing than expected—currently low-probability with the provided data.",
