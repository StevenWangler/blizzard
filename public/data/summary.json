    "No meaningful snow/ice falling during the 6–9 AM commute window (trace/flurries only, and that late evening after school)",

    "Road impacts are most likely limited to localized slick spots from refreeze/black ice (bridges/ramps/untreated residential roads), not a widespread glaze event",
    "Patchy reduced visibility (forecast ~1–2 miles) could slow rural bus routes but rarely closes schools by itself",

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, news intel, infrastructure, and power-grid inputs, the base case is a normal Michigan winter operating day: essentially no accumulating snow during bus hours, modest winds, and no extreme-cold closure trigger in the provided (fresh) API forecast. The main credible disruption mechanism is localized black ice from earlier-evening light freezing drizzle and/or refreeze on bridges/untreated neighborhoods, plus possible patchy fog/low stratus reducing visibility to ~1–2 miles. That pattern historically produces occasional delays, but full closures are uncommon without a widespread ice event, heavy snow timing during the commute, or extreme wind chills. News intelligence shows no emerging wave of neighboring-district closures and no Rockford announcement, which keeps the probability low. A web-source wind-chill discrepancy exists (stale cached pages vs API), but no credible source in the provided verifier output shows ≤-20°F for Feb 5 bus hours; therefore the automatic extreme-cold rule is not triggered. Net: low snow-day odds, with a higher (but still minority) chance of a 1–2 hour delay if slick-spot reports or fog are worse than expected by ~5:45–6:15 AM.",
