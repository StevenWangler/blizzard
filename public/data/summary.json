  "decision_rationale": "There is a major conflict in the wind-chill guidance: WeatherAPI suggests ~-10°F to -12°F feels-like during 6–8 AM, while the Web Weather Verifier found Weather.com showing -26°F to -27°F in the same window, plus regional NWS-referenced messaging discussing pockets near -25°F. Per the non-negotiable Extreme Cold Rules, ONE credible source at ≤ -20°F during bus hours forces a 90–95% closure probability because of student exposure at stops and operational bus-start concerns. \n\nEven setting cold aside, there is a credible (though likely patchy) black-ice/glaze risk from light freezing drizzle/freezing rain around midnight–2 AM, and in subzero air/pavement temperatures any slickness will not “improve quickly.” Infrastructure and safety inputs agree: main roads should generally be workable, but secondary/neighborhood roads can remain variable—this profile often leads to delays rather than full closure. However, the extreme wind-chill trigger dominates the closure decision under your rules, so the final probability is kept in the mandated 90–95% range.\n\nWhat could make this wrong (i.e., schools stay open): if the Weather.com wind chills are materially overstated and actual 6–8 AM wind chills verify closer to -10°F to -15°F, and if the overnight glaze is minimal/treated, Rockford could run on-time or with a delay. That is why confidence is only moderate despite the high probability (the high probability is rule-driven, not consensus-driven).",
