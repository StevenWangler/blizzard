  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorologist: No new accumulating snow or ice; dry, overcast, mid‑20s°F; normal winter day for Michigan with essentially 0% snow‑day chance.\n- Historian: Very similar past patterns (storm one day, dry/cold the next) almost always have school open; historical closure rates 2–10% for this setup.\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely plowed and treated; primary 9/10, secondary 8/10; low overall risk; normal on‑time start recommended.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closures posted; TV closing lists are quiet; NWS highlights only cold and a low chance of flurries. Community and media framing is “cold after a storm,” not a shutdown event.\n\nAll four agree: no significant new storm on Thursday, conditions are manageable, and closure is unlikely.\n\n2. Disagreements or nuances\n- Meteorologist gives an almost absolute 0% closure probability.\n- Historian allows a small tail risk (up to ~10%) based on rare cases where refreeze or local issues prompt delays/isolated closures.\n- Safety flags only a moderate risk of refreeze on some untreated surfaces (bridges, shaded back roads, parking lot patches), but still calls risk \"low\" and commute impact \"minimal.\"\n- News/Intel notes uncertainty in social media chatter, but there is no strong buzz that “schools will definitely close.”\n\nThese are not true conflicts; they differ only on the tiny residual risk from unexpected ice or localized problems.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Main mixed‑precip event and 2–4\" snow occurred Wednesday (12/10). By the timestamp (late evening Wed), the system has largely exited.\n- Forecast for Thu 12/11: 0% morning snow, no new accumulation. That gives:\n  • Many hours of plow and salt work from Wednesday daytime through the night.\n  • From roughly Wed 18:00 to Thu 05:00 (about 11 hours) for roads to be cleared, salt to work, and traffic to improve conditions before early buses.\n- Safety analysis: worst (i.e., slickest) conditions timeframe 00:00–07:00 Thu due to refreeze, but still only \"minimal\" commute impact. With no fresh snow during those hours, it’s just a refreeze management problem, which Michigan road crews handle routinely.\n- Time from any lingering light slush late Wed evening to bus time Thursday is long enough that roads should stabilize. Plow timing is clearly favorable for staying open.\n\n4. Ice/black ice risk\n- There is *no* new freezing rain or active ice storm on Thu. The only concern is refreeze of leftover moisture from Wed on cold pavement, especially:\n  • Bridges and overpasses\n  • Shaded rural/secondary roads\n  • School parking lots and sidewalks where melt occurred\n- Temperatures stay in the 20s°F (below 32°F) but steady, not crashing rapidly. This favors predictable, treatable refreeze rather than a surprise flash‑freeze scenario.\n- Safety analyst explicitly recommends standard caution and salting but still supports a normal start. Ice exists as a minor, localized hazard, not a system‑wide ice event that typically triggers closures.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News/Intel review of Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, and TV closing boards shows *no* announced closures or delays for Thu 12/11.\n- No three‑plus neighboring district closures; therefore, per the given rules, there is *no* upward probability adjustment from regional domino effects.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nMain failure modes:\n- Unexpected overnight freezing drizzle or a surprise narrow band of snow not in the forecast that ices over roads right before the commute.\n- More extensive black ice than anticipated due to under‑salting, equipment failures, or localized cold spots—particularly on rural bus routes.\n- A late‑breaking district‑level operational concern (e.g., significant power outages, bus fleet issues, or staffing shortages) that leads to closure despite reasonable weather.\n\nGiven the meteorological data (0% snow chance, no ice forecast, winds light), these are low‑probability but non‑zero possibilities. They justify a non‑zero closure probability but still very low.\n\n7. Weighting of experts and final probability\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates essentially 0% closure based on weather alone. This pulls the baseline strongly toward 0–2%.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, normal operations, slight refreeze caution. This supports a low but non‑zero probability (~3–5%).\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 2–10%, with conditions closest to the ~2–5% pattern (dry, cold day after a storm). This nudges us to ~3–4%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no strong closure buzz, no official alerts. This again supports the low end (~2–4%) rather than anything higher.\n\nIntegrating:\n- Raw weighted expectation clusters very close to 2–4%.\n- Michigan tolerance for snow/ice is high, and none of the high‑threshold triggers (8+\" snow, active ice, blizzard, extreme cold) are present.\n- There is no neighboring‑district domino effect to push the number upward.\n\nTo stay decisive and optimize Brier score, I choose **3%** (not a vague mid‑range). This captures the small tail risk from unexpected ice or operational surprises while reflecting strong consensus that school will be open.\n\nConclusion: Snow day (full closure) for Rockford Public Schools on Thu 2025‑12‑11 is very unlikely; expect a normal on‑time school day with routine winter cautions.",
