    "No new snow/ice forecast for Monday in the Rockford point forecast (0\" precip/snow) with good visibility—this is the dominant factor in Michigan closure decisions",
    "Wind chills around +7°F to +9°F at 6–8 AM are cold but far above Michigan’s closure thresholds (no extreme-cold trigger)",
    "Main risk is SECOND-ORDER: patchy black ice from refreeze on bridges/shaded secondary & residential roads; typically a caution/delay issue, not a district-wide closure",
    "Infrastructure signals: highways/county roads generally clear; no storm-driven plow operations expected Monday AM",
    "News/decision signals are quiet: FOX17 closings board shows no active closings/delays; no Rockford or neighboring-district closure chatter detected; no meaningful outage signal (statewide outages very low)"

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, and news intel, there’s strong agreement that Monday (Feb 23) is a cold, DRY day in Rockford with no accumulating snow or active precipitation expected and no advisories. That profile almost never produces a full snow day in West Michigan. The only credible pathway to disruption is a refreeze/black-ice morning on untreated bridges, shaded curves, and low-traffic neighborhood streets—consistent with minor incidents or, at most, a targeted delay if early-morning route scouting finds widespread glaze. Community/administrative signals also lean ‘open’: FOX17’s closings board shows no active closings/delays and there are no confirmed neighboring-district closures (reducing domino pressure). Power-grid conditions are not a driver; outage counts are very low statewide and trending down, with no evidence of a localized Rockford outage in the available data. Net: opening is the baseline, with enhanced monitoring for localized slick spots.",
