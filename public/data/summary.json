  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement / conflict check\n- Meteorologist: Cold, quiet, dry morning with essentially no snow (≈0.02\" total late), steady subfreezing temps, no ice signal, no alerts. Explicitly rates snow-day probability near 0–5%.\n- Historian: Very similar past patterns (cold, mostly dry days) have snow-day rates of 2–5%. Notes Rockford normally closes for big storms (6–10\"+), ice, or more dangerous wind chills than forecast here.\n- Safety analyst: Primary/secondary roads and parking lots scored 8–9/10, risk level low, morning and afternoon commute impacts minimal. Recommends normal operations with standard winter caution.\n- News & community intel: No winter storm watches/warnings, no RPS or neighboring district closure notices, no TV \"closings watch\" narratives, and social media sentiment is routine winter, not storm-focused.\nAll four lines of evidence independently point to a very low closure probability with **no meaningful conflicts**.\n\n2. Disagreements\nThere are no substantive disagreements:\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all cluster in the 0–5% closure range.\n- News intel shows no neighboring closures or strong community expectation of a snow day.\nAny minor nuance (e.g., moderate residual ice risk in a few spots) does not rise to the level of contradicting the overall low-risk picture.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions window (per safety analyst): 00:00–08:00 on 2025-12-15, but that is essentially just cold, with **no new accumulating snow**.\n- Morning commute: 06:00–08:00 is dry, ~20°F, with winds 10–20 mph and no active precip.\n- There is effectively **nothing fresh to plow** before the school day; road crews have had previous days to treat residual snow/ice. Buses and cars encounter treated, stable winter surfaces rather than active storm cleanup.\n- By the time of a 7:40 AM school start, roads should be in standard winter condition, not under active heavy plowing. Plow timing therefore strongly favors **holding school**.\n\n4. Ice risk\n- Temperatures remain safely below freezing with no signal of active freezing rain or a flash-freeze event in the pre-dawn period.\n- Safety analyst marks ice formation risk as \"moderate\", interpreted as residual slick patches on lesser-treated surfaces rather than a region-wide glaze.\n- No NWS ice advisories, no news reports of widespread ice, and no power outage clusters that would indicate significant icing.\nTherefore, there is **no major ice storm component**, which is typically required in Michigan to push probabilities into the 60%+ closure range even with lower snow totals.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News intel explicitly notes: as of Dec. 13, no posted closures or advance closure plans for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD.\n- Local TV closing lists (WOOD TV8, WZZM 13, FOX 17) show no Monday-specific closures or strong pre-closure chatter.\n- That means **0 neighboring districts pre-closed**, so the Michigan rule-of-thumb adjustment (+15–20% for 3+ neighboring closures) does **not** apply.\n\n6. How this fits Michigan thresholds\nUsing the provided Michigan closure thresholds:\n- Forecast snow: about 0\" during the relevant window; calendar-day total ≈0.02\" late at night. This is effectively in the \"<4\" snow\" category, where baseline closure odds are 5–15% **for a typical event**. But here it’s even less impactful because there isn’t a real event—just a trace.\n- No ice storm and no blizzard conditions.\n- Wind chills: cold single digits, but typically districts begin seriously considering cold closures closer to -20°F and below; this forecast is not there.\n- Historically similar setups: 2–5% closure rate.\nGiven all that, a value at the **bottom** of the <4\" category is justified.\n\n7. Weighting the experts (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Very low impact weather; assigns ~0–5% closure likelihood. I anchor this analysis as the main driver.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good roads, minimal commute impact. This fully supports the meteorological assessment, keeping the probability near the lower bound.\n- History (20%): Similar days close 2–5% of the time, favoring a number close to 3–4% rather than zero, because rare, non-weather administrative or hyper-local issues can occasionally cause closure.\n- News intelligence (20%): No neighboring closures, no strong social media expectation, no official concern. This keeps the probability from drifting upward.\nCombining these, the weighted consensus naturally falls around **3%**.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 3% forecast could miss are:\n- A **sudden, unforecast storm development** or lake-effect band that sets up over northern Kent County overnight Sunday into Monday, producing several inches with bad timing.\n- A **surprise ice event** (e.g., unexpected freezing drizzle) overnight, creating widespread black ice before plows and salt trucks can respond.\n- **Operational issues**, such as a major, localized power outage or bus fleet/transportation problem not caused by weather.\nAs of the analysis timestamp (2025-12-13T23:05:30Z), none of these are indicated by the data or intelligence sources.\n\n9. Final call\nGiven:\n- Near-zero new snow, no ice storm, and no significant visibility problems.\n- Historically low closure rates for similar patterns (2–5%).\n- Strong agreement among meteorology, safety, history, and news intel.\nI set the snow day probability for Rockford, MI on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025 at **3%**, with **high confidence** that school will be open on a normal schedule.",
