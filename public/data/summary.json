    "No plowable snowfall expected (near 0\"), light winds → classic low-closure setup for West Michigan",
    "Main risk is early-morning freezing fog/low stratus with potentially very low visibility roughly 4–8 AM (bus safety)",
    "Trace freezing drizzle/freezing rain around midnight + refreeze of existing moisture/hard-pack → isolated black ice risk (especially secondary/neighborhood roads, bridges, shaded spots)",
    "Roads: main routes likely passable by 6:30 AM, but neighborhood streets may remain hard-pack/patchy slick in extreme cold; salt effectiveness reduced",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closure/delay cascade for Thu 1/29; weak real-time closure signal",
    "Power outages appear minimal systemwide; no outage-driven closure signal",
    "Wind chill does NOT approach the ≤ -20°F near-auto-closure threshold; web verification does not contradict this"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts converge on (a) essentially no accumulating snow, (b) no dangerous wind-chill trigger (not ≤ -20°F), (c) primary risk is fog/visibility + patchy black ice/refreeze, and (d) a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The key conflict is how literally to take the WeatherAPI ‘0 mi visibility’ hours. Meteorology cautions it may be an encoding artifact; Safety treats it as a meaningful bus-safety red flag. Web verification could not confirm METAR/AFD, so I weight this as a real risk but with uncertainty.\n3) Plow timing math: Measurable/impactful precip largely wrapped up by late Wed morning/early afternoon, leaving ~17 hours until 6:30 AM Thu for overnight touch-up. Infrastructure expects primaries/bus-route arterials passable by 6:30 AM, with neighborhoods lagging.\n4) Ice: Yes, but mainly isolated black ice/refreeze and spot glazing (not a widespread ice storm). That supports delay/caution more than district-wide closure.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Thu 1/29 closure/delay announcements tonight across nearby districts checked—so no +15–20% cascade bump.\n6) Power: Consumers roll-up shows extremely low outages; no meaningful outage adjustment.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier finds no credible signal of wind chill ≤ -20°F; thus no cold-based near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make this wrong: If dense freezing fog truly produces widespread near-zero visibility on rural routes at 6–8 AM OR if trace icing is more widespread than expected on neighborhood roads/bridges, the district could choose a proactive closure (tail risk). Conversely, if fog is patchy/lifts early, it will be a normal day (or at most increased caution).\n\nWeighting per directive: Meteorology (25%) and Safety (25%) drive the outcome: no snow lowers closure sharply, but the commute-window visibility/black-ice risk keeps a non-trivial tail. History (15%) anchors low closure rates for “no new snow” patterns. News intel (15%) provides no closure-cascade confirmation (keeps probability from rising). Infrastructure (10%) indicates roads mostly passable by 6:30 with neighborhood slick spots (supports delay over closure). Power (5%) lowers outage concern. Web verifier (5%) removes extreme cold as a closure driver.\n\nFinal call: 20% probability of a full closure (snow day). Practical expectation is ‘open’ with an elevated chance of a 1–2 hour delay; however this output specifically estimates closure probability per request.",
