    "No accumulating snow/precip expected (0\") and light winds—Michigan districts typically stay open in these conditions",

    "Wind chill is *not* at extreme-closure thresholds: web sources range roughly feels-like -15°F to +7°F; none show ≤ -20°F, so automatic-closure rule is not triggered",

  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on a cold, dry operating day with the only meaningful risk coming from localized refreeze/black ice (and a lower-confidence fog/visibility signal). Meteorology shows 0\" precip/snow and light winds, which in West Michigan strongly favors staying open. History supports a very low closure base rate for ‘cold but dry’ days (~3–8%), with only a small tail risk if freezing fog or refreeze becomes widespread. Safety analysis explains the ‘moderate’ commute impact is driven by uncertainty about residual moisture from Tuesday and the fact that at ~10–15°F any moisture becomes persistent ice on bridges, shaded stretches, rural connectors, and neighborhood streets—conditions that more often justify a *2-hour delay* than a full cancellation. News intelligence shows no neighboring district closures posted (FOX17 still empty), no buzz, and no outage chatter; that removes the usual “domino effect” pressure. Power-grid checks show minimal outages and decreasing trend, making outage-driven closure unlikely. There is a notable wind-chill discrepancy between WeatherAPI and Weather.com variants (roughly +5°F to as low as ~-15°F feels-like), but none meet the ≤ -20°F automatic closure trigger; even at -15°F, Rockford might consider cold-exposure mitigations but this is typically not enough alone to close without other hazards. Net: full snow day/closure remains unlikely; the more realistic operational risk is a *delay* if pre-dawn route checks find widespread glaze on bus routes.",
