  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on a low closure probability (about 4–5%) and the web verification does not show any extreme wind chill (≤ -20°F) that would force a high-probability cold closure. Meteorology and infrastructure agree there is no snow accumulation expected and no meaningful morning precipitation—so the usual Michigan closure drivers (plowable snow during commute, ice storm, blizzard winds/drifting) are absent. Safety concerns are real but localized: dense fog plus near-freezing temps can create a ‘looks wet but is slick’ situation mainly on bridges/overpasses, shaded rural connectors, and parking-lot/bus-loop surfaces; that supports caution messaging or (less likely) a short delay if early-morning observations confirm widespread slickness. News/community signals show no closure cascade in neighboring districts and no Rockford-specific weather-closure hints; power grid risk appears low and there are no confirmed outages/activations. Net: Rockford should plan to OPEN, with monitoring for a possible 2-hour delay only if fog is denser than forecast or if widespread early road/bridge icing is verified.",
