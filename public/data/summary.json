    "Ice risk (light freezing rain/drizzle) during the 5–8 AM bus/commute window; even ~0.01\" can create a high-impact glaze on untreated surfaces",
    "Road readiness is marginal at 6:30 AM: county/local streets likely still partially covered/spot-icy; improvement more likely after ~8:00 AM (supports delay > closure)",
    "Regional travel hazards have been severe (multiple freeway crashes/closures Tuesday); increases odds of residual slickness/refreeze overnight",
    "Wind chill is a key uncertainty: Weather.com indicates ≤ -20°F (near-automatic closure trigger), but WeatherAPI does not; not verified by NWS in-session",
    "Power grid largely intact (99.99% with power) with only small outage totals; outages not currently a primary closure driver"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: this is NOT a snow-accumulation event; the main school-morning hazard is ICE/black ice from light freezing rain/drizzle and potential freezing fog, with very cold temps preventing melt. Most agree a DELAY is more likely than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: wind chill severity. WeatherAPI keeps wind chill around ~-4 to -8°F (no closure trigger), while Weather.com shows ~-22 to -24°F during 5–8 AM (would strongly push closure). NWS hourly wind chill could not be confirmed in-session, so I cannot treat ≤ -20°F as verified.\n3) Plow timing math: precip/icing risk extends to ~07:00; bus window ~06:30. That leaves ~0–0.5 hours from precip end to buses (too little buffer). Infrastructure expects state highways trending passable but not clear by 06:30; county roads improving closer to 08:30; local streets often not in good shape until ~10:00. This supports disruption but leans DELAY over full closure.\n4) Any ice? Yes—this is the dominant risk factor, with high ice-formation risk from safety/infrastructure.\n5) Neighboring districts: no confirmed Wed full-day closures found; however, Forest Hills has Wed afternoon activities canceled (mild signal of continued impacts). Lack of multiple confirmed district closures keeps probability from jumping.\n6) Power outages: system-wide outages are low; no confirmed school-facility outages—small upward pressure only.\n7) Wind chill verification: conflicting sources; ≤ -20°F not confirmed by multiple sources, so no automatic-closure move.\n8) What would make me wrong? (a) Wind chill actually does reach ≤ -20°F at bus time (many districts close proactively), (b) freezing drizzle coverage is broader than implied and creates widespread glaze on secondary roads, or (c) residual Tuesday conditions refreeze harder than expected, leaving bus routes unsafe despite treatment.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (ice timing/QPF) + Safety (bus-route risk) drive the call upward, but History (low closure rates for light-QPF glaze events) and News (no confirmed Wed closures; only activity cancellations) keep it below 40%. Infrastructure data confidence is low but indicates marginal 6:30 AM conditions—favoring delay as the modal outcome. Net: I set full-closure probability at 30% (with a higher, implied chance of a 2-hour delay).",
