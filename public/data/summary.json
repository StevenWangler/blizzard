    "Power grid signal is benign: statewide outages very low; no evidence of concentrated Rockford/Kent outages that would force closure"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All specialists converged on a low-but-nonzero closure risk (consensus 12%), and the follow-up checks did not reveal the key triggers that usually push Michigan districts into closing. Meteorology indicates a dry Monday with moderate NNW wind and no accumulating precipitation during decision hours; wind chills are uncomfortable but not near extreme-cold thresholds. Safety/infrastructure concerns center on residual slick spots from Sunday’s light snow/freezing-rain signals and an overnight refreeze, which can create patchy black ice—especially on bridges, shaded stretches, and lower-priority neighborhood/rural roads. However, with ~21 hours between Sunday’s precip tapering and Monday bus time, and with normal plow/salt resources, Rockford can usually operate (possibly with spot-treatment and route checks). News intel did not confirm Rockford or neighboring-district closures from official sources in this environment (and absence of a notice is only a mild ‘open’ signal). Power-grid status shows very limited outages, making a utility-forced closure unlikely. Net: recommend OPEN with monitoring; a 2-hour delay is the main contingency if early-morning route checks find widespread untreated ice on secondary roads.",
