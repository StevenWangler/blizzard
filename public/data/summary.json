  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert Agreement vs. Conflict\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorology: Storm is essentially over by Sunday morning; Monday is cold, mainly dry, with only ~0.25\" of new snow late evening, well after school.\n  • Safety: Worst travel is Sat night–Sun; Monday commute impact “minimal” for both morning and afternoon, with good visibility and plowable, firm surfaces.\n  • History: Patterns with a major weekend storm followed by a quiet Monday typically yield relatively low closure rates when plows have an overnight window and there’s no new snow/ice.\n  • News/Intel: No closures, no delays, no power or infrastructure issues, and no strong social chatter about a likely snow day.\n  All four point to a normal school day being more likely than a closure.\n\n- Potential conflicts:\n  • Meteorology mentions a significant 6–10\"+ storm total over the weekend (serious weather), yet still sees Monday as low-risk.\n  • Historical dataset includes one pattern (“post-warning cleanup day”) with a higher 40% snow-day rate, but that is tempered by others (5% and 15%) and by modern local practice.\n  Overall, this is not a true conflict: the higher 40% pattern typically applies when cleanup lags or the warning extends into the school day, both of which are not indicated here.\n\n2. Plow Timing Math\n- Worst conditions (heavy snow under the Winter Storm Warning): Sat night–Sun morning, ending around late Sunday morning (worst 00:00–12:00 Sunday per safety tool).\n- Monday first bell / bus runs: around 6:00–7:40 AM Monday.\n- Effective cleanup window: roughly midday Sunday through overnight into early Monday (about 18–24 hours of improving, mainly dry weather).\n- Safety analyst scores: primary roads 8/10, secondary 7/10, lots 7/10, and commute impacts “minimal.” This strongly supports that plow crews have enough time to push back snow, salt, and treat priority areas.\n\n3. Ice Risk\n- Meteorology: No signal for freezing rain or mixed precip during the Monday commute; only very light snow late Monday evening.\n- Temps: teens to mid-20s°F, so any melt Sunday could refreeze, but surfaces are expected to be packed snow/treated, not slush transitioning to glaze.\n- Safety: Calls ice-formation risk “moderate” due to residual patches on untreated surfaces, but not systemic glazing.\n- No ice storm warning, no active mixed precip.\nConclusion: There may be slick spots and patches of ice on secondary roads, sidewalks, and lots, but not the widespread ice event that typically drives high closure probabilities.\n\n4. Neighboring Districts / Community Signals\n- News intel: Neighboring_district_closures is an empty list; there are no confirmed closures or announced delays in nearby districts.\n- Rockford Public Schools official site: explicitly shows a normal return on Mon 12/1, no weather alerts.\n- Community sentiment: flagged as “uncertain,” but importantly there is no groundswell of “we definitely won’t have school” chatter.\nAccording to the weighting rules, lack of neighboring closures and lack of a strong ‘expect closure’ sentiment mean we do NOT apply any of the +15–20% or +10–15% upward adjustments from news intelligence.\n\n5. Weighting the Four Expert Domains\nUsing the given weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Very low new snow for Monday, no ice signal, calm winds. This alone suggests something like a 10–20% snow-day likelihood (driven more by residual snowpack than active weather). I anchor meteorology’s contribution near 15%.\n- Safety (25%): Road/lot scores 7–8/10 and “minimal” commute impact imply that conditions are generally manageable with standard caution. Safety assessment aligns with a similar 10–20% closure chance, mainly for outlier cases of poor cleanup. I weight safety around 15%.\n- History (20%): The three analogs give 40%, 5%, and 15% closure rates. The most representative for this specific forecast—big weekend storm, quiet Monday—appears closer to the 10–15% pattern, especially in West Michigan where plowing is robust. The seasonal adjustment is negative (-0.15), reflecting that this is a region used to such events. I synthesize historical guidance near 15–20%.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closures, no power issues, no pre-emptive concern from the district. This strongly biases against a closure; I translate that to roughly a 5–10% implied chance from the community/administrative behavior signal.\nCombining these, with slightly more weight on meteorology and safety, produces a mixed, but still clearly low, probability band around 15–20%. I select 18% to stay outside the 40–60% “mushy middle” and reflect a slightly elevated chance versus a totally ordinary day, because 6–10\" of weekend snow can occasionally cause Monday surprises if cleanup lags.\n\n6. Michigan-Specific Thresholds\n- New Monday snow: ~0\" during commute, ~0.25\" late evening → fits well below the <4\" band, where base probabilities are 5–15%.\n- Total storm context: 6–10\"+ already fell, but that was mainly Sat–Sun. With a full day’s cleanup and no new accumulation Monday, West Michigan norms lean strongly toward holding school.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard conditions, no extreme wind chills. This keeps us solidly in the low-probability regime.\n\n7. What Would Make This Prediction Wrong?\nA closure would be more likely than 18% if:\n- Plow operations fall significantly behind (e.g., equipment breakdowns, staffing issues) leaving many secondary roads and school lots badly rutted or blocked by Monday predawn, or\n- Unforecasted issues appear: power outages near key buildings, surprise band of lake-effect snow into the commute, or widespread black ice from unexpected partial thaw/refreeze.\nNone of these are indicated now, but they are the main downside risks.\n\nPutting this together: all four expert domains converge on a low, but non-zero, chance of a snow day, dominated by residual cleanup rather than weather on Monday itself. Hence the final estimate: 18% with high confidence that school will be open.",
