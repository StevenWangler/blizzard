    "No accumulating snow/ice expected in the 00:00–09:00 window (hourly precip and snow fields are zero); plows not a factor",
    "Temps stay below freezing (~15–20°F) with very high humidity → patchy freezing fog/mist and isolated black-ice risk, mainly bridges/overpasses and rural shaded roads",
    "Visibility reduction is forecast but not extreme (generally ~3 miles during 06:00–09:00); widespread dense fog (≤0.25 mi) not indicated in the provided hourly forecast",
    "No extreme-cold closure trigger: no credible source shows ≤ -20°F wind chill during 6–8 AM",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays for Mon 02/02 yet; no community ‘closure buzz’; power grid/outage levels appear very low and stable"

  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs generally agree this is NOT a snow/ice-accumulation event for Rockford on Mon 02/02, which is the dominant driver in Michigan closure decisions. The only meaningful operational hazard is a narrow early-morning window where subfreezing temperatures and near-saturated air support mist/freezing-fog potential. That can create localized slick spots (black ice) and reduced visibility on bus routes, but the forecast visibility signal is not near typical closure thresholds and the risk is expected to be patchy rather than widespread. Infrastructure indications are ‘already clear’ with only possible spot-treatment; power outage risk is low; and there are no confirmed neighboring-district closures or Rockford PS signals for 02/02 at this time. Web verification showed conflicting temperature solutions across apps, but none show ≤ -20°F wind chills during bus hours (so no automatic cold-closure rule is triggered). Net: a full closure remains unlikely; a short delay is the more realistic disruption if fog/glaze verifies worse than forecast.",
