    "No accumulating precip expected Thu 2/26 (0\" snow; quiet pattern) → Michigan districts almost always stay open",
    "Temps ~19–21°F at bus time create refreeze/black-ice potential, but with no new precip this should be patchy (bridges/ramps/shaded secondary roads) rather than widespread",
    "Road agencies signaling pretreatment/early operations (KCRC message via FOX17) reduces the odds that patchy slick spots become a district-wide shutdown",
    "No confirmed weather-related neighboring-district closures or Rockford PS closure/delay signals as of latest checks (weak ‘domino effect’)",
    "Power grid risk low: only ~1.3k Consumers Energy customers out statewide; no verified Rockford-area outage affecting schools"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on a dry, cold-but-manageable Thursday for Rockford with no active snow/ice falling during the commute. That is a strongly “OPEN” profile in Michigan. The only credible disruption pathway is residual moisture/slush from Wednesday refreezing overnight, creating patchy black ice on secondary/rural roads, bridge decks, ramps, and shaded curves during the 5:30–9:00 AM window. News intel adds one meaningful caution flag (KCRC publicly preparing for icy roads), but it does not come with confirmation of a new freezing-precip mechanism on Thursday—so the likely outcome is localized slick spots rather than widespread glaze. Infrastructure assessment supports that trunklines and primary bus-route roads should be serviceable by 6:30 AM given the long overnight treatment window, with neighborhoods the ‘last mile’ concern. Power-grid signals do not point to a closure trigger. With no neighboring weather closures and no Rockford announcement hints, the domino pressure is absent. Net: a full closure is unlikely; the bigger operational risk is a short delay if early AM bus checks find multiple rural trouble spots.",
