    "Temperatures stay above freezing during the 6–8 AM bus window (mid-30s °F) with rising trend; wind chills mid/upper-20s—no extreme-cold trigger",

    "Main operational risk is *localized* slick bridges/overpasses and a few colder rural connectors if pavement temps briefly touch ~32°F—not a district-wide snow/ice event",

    "News/community signals show no closure chatter and no confirmed neighboring-district domino closures; power outage risk appears low"

  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on the same base case: this is a rain (not snow) morning with air temperatures holding above freezing (roughly 34–36°F) and rising through the commute. Web verification does not show any wind chill anywhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds, and snowfall is consistently 0\" across sources. With Michigan’s high snow-day bar, that combination strongly favors OPEN.\n\nThe only meaningful disagreement was how to interpret “moderate” ice risk. I resolve it as a *localized hazard* rather than a district-wide closure driver: bridges/overpasses and low-traffic rural connectors can briefly glaze if pavement temps lag air temps near daybreak, especially right as rain begins (~5 AM). That scenario more often produces slower travel and possibly a DELAY, not a full closure.\n\nNews intelligence provides a key tiebreaker: no verified Rockford or neighboring-district closure announcements and no community buzz, reducing the likelihood of a proactive closure. Infrastructure and power-grid checks show no strong operational constraint (no plowable snow; low outage risk). Net: low single-digit-to-low-teens closure odds; I set 9% to reflect the non-zero “black ice surprise” tail risk during 5–9 AM while still being decisive that the most likely outcome is OPEN (possibly with a short delay if observations deteriorate).",
