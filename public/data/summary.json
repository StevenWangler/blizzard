    "Light snow total (~1.2\") focused Sunday late morning–early afternoon with ~16+ hours for plows/treatment before Monday bus routes",
    "No extreme cold signal: estimated Mon 6–8 AM wind chills ~15–20°F (well above Michigan closure thresholds)",
    "Main credible failure mode is patchy refreeze/black ice on untreated secondary/residential roads, bridges, and parking lots—not widespread snowfall",
    "Infrastructure capacity appears normal (adequate salt/sand, full staffing) and primary roads/bus-route corridors expected to be in good shape by 6:30 AM",
    "News intel: no closure/delay announcements or neighboring-district domino effect yet; only notable signal is KCRC ‘ice/pretreat’ posture, which bumps risk slightly"

  "decision_rationale": "All experts broadly agree the *base case* is a routine West Michigan winter situation: around ~1\" of snow on Sunday ending early afternoon, modest winds, and temps in the upper 20s to near 30°F. That provides ample plow/treatment time before Monday’s 6–8 AM bus window (infrastructure estimate: ~16.5 hours). The meteorologist’s pattern-based estimate for Monday morning is dry or flurries at most, with wind chills ~15–20°F—far from the -15°F to -20°F and ≤-20°F closure triggers.\n\nThe main disagreement/uncertainty is whether FOX17’s “ice storm prep” messaging implies *more* icing risk than the Rockford point forecast shows. After clarification, both meteorology and infrastructure see the more likely ice mechanism as *refreeze* (wet/slushy residue Sunday → patchy black ice overnight), not a new freezing-drizzle event during bus time. News intel also found no confirmed neighboring-district closures and no community buzz—signals that typically precede conservative closures.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for closures, the best Brier-optimized call is still LOW for a full closure, but not minimal because patchy black ice on rural/secondary bus routes is the realistic pathway to disruption. Net: 18% for a full snow day (closure), with disruption more likely to take the form of a targeted delay than a full cancel.",
