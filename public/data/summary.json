  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Explicitly states 0.00\" liquid, 0.0\" snow, 0% chance of precip every hour, light winds, no alerts, routine gray day with *no weather-driven reason to cancel or delay school*.\n- Historian: Multiple close analogs with a historical snow-day rate of 0%, high confidence; emphasizes that real closures here require heavy snow, ice, or dangerous cold—none present.\n- Safety analyst: Rates primary and secondary roads 9/10, walking 8/10, morning and afternoon impacts \"minimal\"; explicitly recommends normal operations with only routine caution.\n- News intelligence: No Rockford or neighboring Kent County closures posted; closing boards show no active closings; community sentiment is \"wait-and-see\" rather than expecting a snow day.\nAll four are aligned: conditions are quiet, hazards are low, and there is no operational or social signal for closure.\nThere are no substantive conflicts. The only slight tension is the safety analyst tagging ice risk as \"moderate\" while the meteorology and history both indicate no freezing rain and low probability of widespread black ice; the safety narrative itself clarifies this as \"isolated slick spots\" rather than systemic hazard.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Forecast shows *no new snow* and no freezing rain from midnight through at least mid-morning, so plow operations for fresh accumulation are essentially irrelevant.\n- Even if there were residual patches from prior days, crews have the entire overnight window plus normal early-morning checks to treat bridges and known trouble spots. With bare/wet roads and no falling snow, the effective plow/treatment window is 6+ hours prior to first buses—well above any concern threshold.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Temp band: ~31.6°F overnight low to 35°F daytime, with no incoming precip.\n- Meteorologist: No freezing rain, no drizzle, no modeled precip; only high humidity/mist with occasional 1–2 mile visibility.\n- Historian: Notes that in similar high-humidity/near-freezing setups *without* active drizzle, large-scale black ice from new precip is not supported.\n- Safety: Calls widespread black ice \"unlikely\" and focuses only on spot treatment of bridges/shaded spots.\nNet: Ice is a *localized, routine* winter concern, not a closure-level threat.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel finds: no Kent County / Rockford-area closings, no domino effect from neighbors, no outage pattern, and no strong social-media drumbeat for a snow day.\n- Michigan-specific rule from the brief: 3+ neighboring districts closed would warrant a +15–20% bump. Here, that figure is exactly zero, so there is **no upward adjustment** from community signals.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\nUsing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly favors \"school as normal\"—no snow, no ice storm, no wind/cold hazard.\n- Safety (25%): Also strongly favors \"school as normal\" with very good road scores and minimal commute impact.\n- History (20%): Shows effectively 0% closure for this pattern; reinforces low risk.\n- News Intel (20%): Confirms no early closures or regional domino and no expectation of a snow day.\nAll four vectors point the same direction, so the combined weighted assessment is extremely low probability. To preserve some uncertainty for unmodeled surprises (e.g., unexpected dense fog or an unforecast slick patch), I do not set this at 0%, but keep it at the low end of the Michigan routine weather baseline.\n\n6. Michigan thresholds calibration\n- New snow: 0\" (well below the <4\" tier already associated with only 5–15% *even if* light snow occurred).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no heavy lake-effect, no extreme cold.\n- No neighboring closures (+0% adjustment).\nGiven that this is *easier* than the light-snow scenarios used to define the 5–15% band, a probability near the bottom of that range is reasonable. I choose **5%** to reflect that closures are never absolutely impossible, but are extremely unlikely based on all available evidence.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nPotential failure modes:\n- A last-minute, unforecast precip event: e.g., a surprise band of freezing drizzle or snow develops overnight creating widespread black ice or slick roads by 4–6 a.m.\n- A non-weather factor: sudden power outages in a large part of the district; a major water/main or building-operations issue that forces closure independent of weather.\n- A forecast model or observation shift between now and 4–5 a.m. indicating much denser fog with near-zero visibility on rural routes than currently expected.\nThese scenarios are possible but not supported by current data, which is why they only justify a small non-zero probability rather than something in the 40–60% middle range.\n\nPutting all of this together, I assess **~5%** chance of a snow day in Rockford, Michigan for Tuesday, 2025-12-23, with **very high confidence** that school will be open on a normal schedule.",
