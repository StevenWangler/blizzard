  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts:\n- Meteorology: No snow, no meaningful precip, temps just above freezing, no alerts, routine gray day.\n- History: Similar past patterns in late December for Rockford show essentially a 0% snow day rate; closures in this region usually require 6–10+ inches of snow, ice storms, or extreme cold—none present.\n- Safety: Road and travel scores are very high (8–9/10), risk level tagged as low, and commute impacts minimal; only minor caution for patchy mist and isolated slick spots.\n- News/Intel: Major West Michigan closing boards (FOX 17, etc.) show no closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, and there’s no strong community expectation of a snow day.\nAll four experts independently point to normal operations. There are no substantive conflicts: the only slight tension is the safety analyst labeling ice risk as \"moderate\" while meteorology shows zero freezing hours and no active precip; taken together, that suggests only hyper-local shady slick spots, not systemic hazard.\n\n2. Plow timing math:\n- No new snow or meaningful precip is expected from midnight through school day, so there is effectively nothing to plow.\n- With no accumulation and above-freezing air temps, any residual moisture on main routes will either stay wet or be handled by routine salting before buses roll.\n- From any minor overnight dampness to the 7:40 AM bell, crews would have 2–4+ hours of margin, but in practice there is no plow-driven constraint on operations.\n\n3. Ice considerations:\n- Meteorology: 0 freezing hours, temps hovering 34–35°F with no forecast freezing drizzle or mixed precip during the commute window.\n- Safety: Flags only a general \"moderate\" ice formation risk and advises checking bridges/overpasses and known trouble spots.\n- History: On days like this (near-freezing but dry), Rockford historically runs school without disruption.\nTogether this supports: possible isolated slick patches, not an ice-event. This falls far below the district’s usual closure threshold.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior:\n- News/Intel explicitly notes no closures or delays listed for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD on the main closing boards.\n- There is no cluster of regional shutdowns and no power or major road emergency signals.\nGiven the explicit rule that 3+ neighboring district closures justify a +15–20% bump, here we have the opposite: zero neighbors closed, so there is no upward adjustment.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): 0\" snow, no precip, above-freezing temps → meteorological snow-day probability ≈ 0–2%.\n- Safety (25%): High road scores, low risk, minimal commute impact → safety-based closure probability ≈ 0–3%.\n- History (20%): Analog events show effectively 0% closure rate → historical component ≈ 0–1%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures on boards, no community expectation of a snow day → news component ≈ 0–3%.\nCombining these yields a blended baseline near 1–2%. Allowing for residual uncertainties (unmodeled micro-icing, last-minute administrative caution), I round slightly up to 3% to avoid an overconfident 0% while still being clearly in the \"very unlikely\" regime.\n\n6. Avoiding the 40–60% band:\nThe evidence is strongly one-sided toward a normal school day: no storm, no ice event, no regional closure pattern, and very supportive history. There is no genuine conflict that would justify a mid-range (40–60%) probability. A low but non-zero value (3%) best fits the data and the Brier-score competition goal.\n\nConclusion: The integrated signal from meteorology, safety, history, and real-time news/community intel points overwhelmingly toward school being open with on-time start and only routine winter-driving caution needed.",
