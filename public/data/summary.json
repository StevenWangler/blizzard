  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Rockford (49341) is cold but quiet Friday—0.00\" precip, 0%–5% chance of any flurry, no accumulating snow, no ice signal, light winds, no advisories locally.\n- Historian: This pattern (cold, dry, no alerts, no accumulation) historically yields an extremely low snow‑day rate (~1–3%) in West‑Central Michigan.\n- Safety analyst: Roads for Friday morning are in good winter shape—primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, low–moderate black‑ice risk, minimal commute impact; normal start is recommended.\n- News intel: No Rockford‑area district has announced a Friday closure or delay; regional messaging frames Friday as a nuisance‑level slick commute at worst, not a crippling storm.\n\nAll agree: cold, typical winter day; no active storm over Rockford during the school window; conditions are compatible with normal operations.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- The only tension is between broad regional headlines (winter weather advisories, several inches of snow in parts of Lower Michigan) and the Rockford‑specific point forecast showing essentially no precip.\n- I resolved this with the meteorologist tool: latest guidance confirms Rockford is *outside* the main advisory snow corridor. The local hourly forecast is dry and self‑consistent; any flurry or freezing drizzle risk is ~5–10% probability and trace at most.\n- News intel further confirms: there is no domino wave of Friday closures in the immediate Grand Rapids/Rockford cluster.\n\nSo, after cross‑checks, there is *no substantive conflict* for Rockford itself—regional advisories apply mainly elsewhere.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Safety analyst places the last meaningful mixed precip/freezing drizzle Thursday around 4–7 PM.\n- Forecast then has **no measurable precip from ~8 PM Thu through at least noon Fri**.\n- That gives:\n  - ~10–12+ dry hours before the 6–8 AM bus window.\n  - ~12–14 dry hours before a ~7:40 AM start.\n- In Kent County’s context, this is ample time for:\n  - County crews to plow/salt mains multiple times if needed.\n  - Targeted attention to rural routes and bus hills.\n  - School grounds crews to clear/salt lots and sidewalks.\n\nPlow timing clearly supports *normal* operations.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorologist: freezing drizzle/ice risk 5–10%; expected additional accumulation ~0.00\" (trace at worst). No freezing rain signal, no ice storm, no glaze layer modeled.\n- Safety analyst: characterizes ice risk as **moderate**, but in context: patchy refreeze on bridges, shaded curves, and spots in parking lots—manageable with salt/sand and routine caution; not systemic glare ice.\n\nSo ice is a background, localized hazard—not a systemwide, closure‑level event.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel (plus original local intel):\n  - Rockford PS: no closure/delay announced for Friday as of Thursday evening.\n  - Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent City, GRPS, Kenowa Hills, Comstock Park: **no Friday closures or delays posted** on district pages or major closings lists.\n  - FOX 17 closings: show earlier‑week closures (e.g., Wed Dec 10) but **no Friday Dec 12 entries** for the Rockford cluster.\n- This means **0 neighboring districts** are known to be closed for Friday. Per your rules, the +15–20% adjustment for 3+ neighboring closures clearly does *not* apply.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\nKey failure modes:\n- An unmodeled surprise band: a narrow lake‑effect or synoptic band sets up over Rockford overnight, dropping 3–5\" between midnight and 7 AM. This conflicts with current 0.00\" guidance and expert meteorological assessment, so probability is very low but not zero.\n- Unexpected freezing drizzle event: low stratus and high humidity produce a few hours of light freezing drizzle, creating widespread glare ice despite low QPF. Current forecast puts this at only 5–10% probability with trace accumulation; still, if this happened, morning road conditions could be much worse than now modeled.\n- Over‑cautious human decision: Superintendents sometimes overreact to regional headlines or earlier‑week closures. But notable: there is *no* strong social/media drumbeat locally that Friday is a “sure snow day,” and all local, Rockford‑specific weather inputs say “quiet.” The odds of a closure *without* matching conditions are small, but nonzero.\n\nGiven these, the main path to being wrong is a **surprise localized hazard** not present in the current data. I still judge that risk as very low.\n\n2. WEIGHTED EXPERT SYNTHESIS\nUsing your specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%):\n  - Rockford‑specific forecast: 0\" new snow, 0%–5% precip, no warnings, typical mid‑20s cold, light wind.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~1–2%.\n- Safety (25%):\n  - Low risk; normal winter operations; minimal commute impact.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~2–3% (allowing for modest caution about patchy ice).\n- History (20%):\n  - Analog snow‑day rates: 1–3% in similar setups.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~2%.\n- News intelligence (20%):\n  - Secret weapon check: \n    - No neighboring Friday closures → **no +15–20% bump**.\n    - Community sentiment: “uncertain / wait‑and‑see,” not “this is a guaranteed snow day.” That nudges probabilities slightly *down* from what regional advisories alone might suggest.\n  - Implied closure probability from behavior signals: ~3–5% (I’ll take ~4% as an upper bound because people are at least talking about the possibility).\n\nCombining (roughly weighted average):\n- 0.35×2% (met) ≈ 0.7%\n- 0.25×3% (safety) ≈ 0.75%\n- 0.20×2% (history) ≈ 0.4%\n- 0.20×4% (news/community) ≈ 0.8%\n≈ 2.65%, which I round to **3%** to appropriately reflect low‑probability tail risks without under‑stating them.\n\n3. MICHIGAN THRESHOLD FRAMEWORK\nYour Michigan thresholds:\n- <4\" snow → 5–15% baseline.\n- Here, forecast is **~0\" new snow** and no ice storm. That’s actually *better* than your lowest threshold (which assumes *some* accumulation). Michigan routinely operates in cold/dry with patchy slick spots—exactly this setup.\n- Because neighboring districts are **not** closed, we *don’t* apply the +15–20% bump.\n- No blizzard, no ice storm, no major wind chill event.\n\nThus, a figure *below* your 5–15% lowest band is justified. I set **3%** to leave a small margin for surprise while still clearly conveying \"extremely unlikely.\"\n\n4. WHY NOT IN THE 40–60% ‘MUSHY MIDDLE’\n- All four experts independently converge on **“very low chance of closure”**.\n- There is no significant conflict between tools after reconciliation.\n- Storm impacts are focused elsewhere in Michigan; Rockford’s point forecast is quiet.\n- Neighboring‑district behavior and sentiment provide no sign of a closure domino.\n\nSo a 40–60% range would badly misrepresent the evidence and produce a poor Brier score. A decisive, low probability is warranted.\n\nFinal call: **Rockford Public Schools are overwhelmingly likely to be OPEN and ON TIME on Friday, December 12, 2025.**",
