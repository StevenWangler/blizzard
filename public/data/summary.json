    "No new precipitation expected Monday morning in Rockford/Kent County (0\" forecast) → main closure drivers (active heavy snow, freezing rain, whiteouts) are absent",
    "Wind chills around +7 to +10°F at bus time: cold but well above Michigan extreme-cold closure thresholds (-15°F to -20°F / ≤-20°F)",
    "Primary risk is *residual refreeze/black ice* from Sunday’s light wintry mix, concentrated 6–9 AM on bridges, ramps, shaded/rural secondary roads, and neighborhood streets",
    "News/decision signals lean strongly toward normal operations: FOX 17 closings page shows “no active closings or delays” at the time checked; no domino effect evident",
    "Power grid conditions appear stable systemwide (Consumers snapshot: very low outages), making power-related closure unlikely"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, and news intel there is broad agreement: Monday is a cold, *dry* post-system day with no falling snow/ice and good visibility. In Michigan (and especially late February), that is almost always an OPEN day unless black ice becomes widespread enough to reliably disrupt bus routes. The safety/infrastructure inputs do flag a real 6–9 AM refreeze window—mainly on secondary/local roads and micro-sites (bridges, shaded areas)—but that pattern historically produces at most a 1–2 hour delay more often than a full cancellation. News intelligence adds an important tie-breaker: FOX 17’s live closings aggregator showed no active closings/delays at the time checked, and there’s no sign of neighboring-district closures that would pressure Rockford into a domino cancellation. Power-outage risk also looks low given the extremely small systemwide outage count. The biggest remaining uncertainty is the *actual* Sunday evening road moisture/icing extent (not fully confirmed by live MiDrive/KCRC snapshots in the accessible data); if it over-performed, a delay becomes more plausible—but that still doesn’t make a full snow day likely.",
