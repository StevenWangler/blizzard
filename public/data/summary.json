  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT VS CONFLICT\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorology: Cold, dry pattern; 0\" new snow; no freezing rain; winds modest; visibility generally good. \n  • Safety: Roads and lots largely in good winter shape (scores 8–9/10); only typical patchy black ice risk; minimal commute impact; low overall risk.\n  • History: Very similar past patterns almost never produce snow days (1–2% closure rate) and none of the usual closure triggers (8\"+ snow, ice, blizzard, or extreme cold) are present.\n  • News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closure chatter or pre-announcements; ISD and TV outlets have no forward-looking closure lists for Dec. 8; calendars show normal school operations.\n  All four point strongly toward a normal school day with only routine winter cold.\n\n- Potential conflicts:\n  • Safety notes a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk due to cold pavement and refreezing, while meteorology shows no active precip and historian notes no ice-style event. This is not a forecast-ice-storm conflict; it simply reflects normal black-ice caution on cold, dry mornings. \n  • Community sentiment is labeled \"uncertain\" rather than strongly expecting school, but there is also no visible push expecting a snow day. This is not a true analytical conflict, just a lack of strong social signal.\n  Net: No material disagreements that would raise closure odds above low single digits.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING / OPERATIONS MATH\n- Snow ends / new snow: None expected Sunday into Monday; effectively 0\" accumulation.\n- With no event ongoing, road crews are managing only residual packed snowbanks and spot ice. \n- Operational window before school: Crews have the entire preceding day and overnight (well over 8–12 hours) to salt/treat known slick spots before typical high school start (~7:40 AM).\n- Since there is no fresh snow to clear, plow timing is effectively \"complete\" long before the school commute. Plow-timing math therefore does not create any pressure for delay or closure.\n\n3. ICE ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain or drizzle signal; snow probability is zero overnight and in the morning.\n- Safety: Describes patchy black ice potential on bridges/untreated surfaces due to cold temps (teens/low 20s°F) and refreeze. \n- History: Confirms that cold mornings with patchy black ice but no storm almost never trigger closures in this region; districts operate buses in similar or worse cold routinely.\n- Conclusion: There is *no* ice storm; only localized ice patches typical for early December. That does not meet the \"ice changes everything\" threshold used for high snow-day probabilities.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / NEWS INTEL EFFECT\n- Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville: No forward-looking closures or delays announced for Monday, Dec. 8.\n- Kent ISD: No regional closure alerts.\n- Local TV/closures: Coverage references a previous storm and closures earlier in the week but nothing for Dec. 8.\n- Community buzz: Quiet/uncertain; no indication that families or staff widely expect a snow day.\n- Per the weighting rules, we only boost the probability if 3+ neighboring districts close or if the community strongly expects closure. Neither is true here, so there is *no upward adjustment* from news intel; if anything, the lack of signals gently reinforces the low base probability.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH EXPLICIT WEIGHTS)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors school open. Quantitatively, conditions resemble a routine cold winter day with 0\" snow and no storm; this suggests roughly a 2–3% closure probability from a pure-weather view.\n- Safety (25% weight): Labels risk \"low\" with minimal commute impact and good road/lot scores. That aligns with ~3–5% probability, mainly to cover unforeseen localized ice or a surprise flurry band.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs show 1–2% closure rate for this pattern. This meaningfully anchors the overall forecast toward the low single digits.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight): No neighboring closures, no preemptive moves by Rockford or Kent ISD, and no closure buzz. That supports a very low likelihood, around 2–4%.\n\nCombining these: the weighted mean sits near 2–3%. Given Michigan’s high closure thresholds and the explicit historical rates, I set the final probability at **3%** to allow a small tail for an unexpected overnight issue while staying faithful to the data.\n\n6. WHY NOT HIGHER (USING THE MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS)\n- Snow: Forecast accumulation is 0\". Even <4\" snow would normally be only 5–15% in this framework; at 0\" and no precip, the baseline is lower than that range.\n- Ice: No freezing rain or widespread glaze expected, so we do *not* trigger the elevated 60–85% ice- or 8\"+ thresholds.\n- Wind/vis: Winds under ~15 mph, visibility generally fine; no blizzard or whiteout component.\n- Cold: Windchills in the single digits to low teens are well within normal operating range and far from the -15°F closure guideline.\n- Neighboring closures: Zero; so we *cannot* apply the +15–20% neighboring-closure bump.\n\n7. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\nTo be transparent about risk, the main ways this 3% estimate could fail are:\n- A surprise precip development: An unmodeled lake-effect snow band or freezing drizzle forms late Sunday night and overperforms, creating slick roads just before the commute.\n- Rapidly worsening ice: More extensive melt/refreeze or foggy conditions lead to black ice far beyond what is typical, causing early-morning crashes that push the district to close or delay.\n- Operational / non-weather issues: A localized power outage, heating failure, or bus fleet problem unrelated to the general weather pattern.\nThese are all low-probability tail events but account for most of the 3% residual risk.\n\n8. FINAL DECISION\nGiven the strong multi-expert consensus, historical closure rates near 1–2%, and lack of any storm, ice event, or neighbor closures, the best calibrated estimate for a weather-related snow day in Rockford, MI on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025 is **3%**, with **high confidence** that school will operate on a normal schedule.",
