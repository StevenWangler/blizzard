  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Dry, cold, typical winter day on Fri Jan 2, 2026. No overnight or morning snow, 0\" accumulation, light winds, good visibility. Prior advisory ends Thu morning and does NOT affect Friday.\n- Historian: Days like this (cold, dry, post-light-advisory, no new precip) almost never produce snow days in West Michigan; historical closure rates ~1–3%.\n- Safety analyst: Roads and walking conditions are good (scores 7–9/10). Only localized black ice possible; recommends standard operations, no closure/delay.\n- News/community intel: No emergency weather messaging, no outage reports, no closure chatter. Conditions framed as routine lake-effect regime, not a major storm.\n\nCommon agreement: Weather and road conditions for Jan 2 are well within normal Michigan operating norms and do NOT justify a snow day on their own.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- The only apparent tension is between:\n  • Meteorology/historian/safety tools: Emphasize a DRY Friday with impacts already cleaned up.\n  • One external regional article mentioning lake-effect through Jan 1–2 with “a few inches possible.”\n- However, the provided meteorological dataset for Rockford specifically states 0\" snow and 0% precip on Jan 2 and high confidence in a dry, cold day. Safety scoring (8–9/10 roads) also implicitly supports the dry, low-impact scenario.\n- News intel confirms that for Rockford itself, there is no sign of a significant storm or disruption.\n\nConclusion: No meaningful operational conflict. Where there is slight external noise about lake-effect, the location-specific forecast, safety scores, and historical context all align on **low impact** for Rockford on Jan 2.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Prior Winter Weather Advisory (for light snow/freezing drizzle) ends: Thu Jan 1 at 07:00 EST.\n- Target school arrival (if there were school): Fri Jan 2 around 07:40 EST.\n- Time gap: ~24 hours + 40 minutes between advisory end and next morning arrival.\n- That is ample time for Kent County road crews to plow/salt and for residual moisture to be treated. With **no new snow** forecast overnight into Friday, plow timing is more than sufficient.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- No freezing rain/mixed precip flags for Thu night–Fri morning; column is cold and dry.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing, so **refreeze** is possible on untreated spots.\n- Safety analyst labels ice formation risk as “moderate” but still gives:\n  • Primary roads: 9/10\n  • Secondary roads: 8/10\n  • Parking lots: 8/10\n- Meteorologist emphasizes no active icing mechanism (no new drizzle or rain); risk is limited to typical Michigan black ice in a few shaded or low-volume areas.\n\nConclusion: There is **no active ice storm or freezing rain event**. Only localized, manageable refreeze risk – not the sort of ice that drives district-wide closures.\n\n(5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel:\n  • No evidence that Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or other Kent County neighbors have announced weather-related closures for Fri Jan 2.\n  • Many neighboring districts are also on winter break around this date.\n  • Kent ISD has no special weather messaging or emergency notices for Jan 2.\n- Under the competition rules, 3+ neighboring districts closing for weather would push the probability up 15–20%. That trigger is **not met**.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Upside risk (actual closure when predicted open):\n  • A last-minute, unforecasted lake-effect band sets up directly over Rockford overnight, dropping 4–8\" with poor timing into the morning commute.\n  • A localized ice event (e.g., surprise freezing drizzle) creates widespread glazing on rural bus routes before crews can respond.\n  • A non-weather factor (power outage, building issue) forces a closure that isn’t captured in the weather-based tools.\n  These all appear low-probability given: zero-snow forecast, no freezing rain signatures, no outage reports, and no significant NWS headlines overlapping Friday.\n\n- Downside risk (predicting high closure probability when no closure occurs):\n  • Overreacting to generalized regional articles about lake-effect while ignoring the precise Rockford forecast.\n  • Misinterpreting normal winter break closures as weather-driven “snow days.”\n  The tools and news intel explicitly clarify that Jan 2 is **scheduled break**, not a weather closure.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Indicates a dry, cold day: 0\" new snow, 0% precip, modest winds, decent visibility, advisory long expired.\n  • In a Michigan context, this is firmly “school as usual” weather.\n  • Drives the base probability very low (around 2–5%).\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Road scores: 8–9/10, walking 7/10, “minimal” morning and afternoon commute impacts.\n  • Recommends standard operations, no closure or delay.\n  • Supports staying at the **low end** of any snow-day probability band.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Historical closure rates for similar days: 1–3%.\n  • Seasonal adjustment is actually negative (conditions less hazardous than a typical active-snow pattern).\n  • Anchors the forecast solidly in the single-digit percent range.\n\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, “secret weapon”):\n  • Critical finding: Rockford Public Schools is **already closed for winter break through Jan 2**, with classes resuming Mon Jan 5.\n  • That means there is no operational “snow day” decision to make; weather is irrelevant to whether school runs on Jan 2.\n  • No neighboring weather-based closures, no snow-day chatter, no outage or emergency signals.\n  • This eliminates any need to bump the probability up for regional coordination; if anything, it reinforces that **any closure on that date is scheduled, not weather-driven**.\n\n3. APPLYING THE MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- Snow/ice criteria:\n  • Forecast snow: 0\" → below the <4\" category, so we start at or below the 5–15% band.\n  • No storm, no ice storm, no blizzard, no 8\"+ totals.\n  • Wind chills (around +10 to +15°F) are well above the -15°F to -20°F cold-closure thresholds.\n- Neighbor coordination:\n  • 0 neighboring districts with weather closures; many simply on winter break.\n  • No +15–20% adjustment.\n\nGiven all this, a pure **weather-based** snow-day probability for a normal school day would be about 2–4%, solidly at the bottom of the Michigan <4\" guideline range.\n\n4. FINAL DECISION AND BRIER-SCORE MINDSET\n- To compete effectively (Brier score), the aim is to be sharp and not inflate probabilities when the signal is overwhelmingly one-sided.\n- Here, all tools converge on: “This is standard cold, mostly dry winter weather with good roads by morning and no major operational hazard.”\n- News intel further reveals: there is **no school scheduled** on Jan 2 due to winter break.\n\nInterpreting “snow day probability” as: probability that Rockford Public Schools is closed **because of weather** on Jan 2, 2026, I assign:\n- **3% probability** of a weather-driven closure (very unlikely) and 97% that any non-school status is purely scheduled break, not a snow day.\n\nThis is decisive (nowhere near the 40–60% uncertainty band) and aligned with historical, meteorological, safety, and community evidence.\n",
