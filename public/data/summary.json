    "Rockford Public Schools is already scheduled CLOSED on Mon 2026-02-16 for Mid-Winter Break (official homepage + calendar + district news post)",
    "Neighboring districts also appear scheduled closed for the same mid-winter break window (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville), so any “domino effect” is calendar-driven, not weather-driven",
    "Weather signal is freezing fog near 30–32°F with potential patchy glaze/black ice and poor visibility during roughly 04:30–09:00; this would normally favor a DELAY decision on a regular school day, not a full closure",
    "No extreme-cold trigger: no credible, date-aligned source shows ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours (web verification inconclusive but no threshold breach flagged)",
    "Power grid is stable with essentially no outages; no infrastructure-driven closure trigger"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Key conflict in the debate was *definition*: some agents predicted “weather-driven cancellation probability” (low, ~10–20%) while others predicted “probability there is no school on that date” (high) because of the calendar.\n\nFor Rockford Public Schools on **Mon Feb 16, 2026**, News Intelligence confirms via multiple official RPS sources that it is **already a scheduled NO SCHOOL day for Mid-Winter Break**, with classes resuming Tue Feb 17. That makes the real-world outcome (no student attendance required) overwhelmingly likely regardless of weather, so the correct operational prediction is very high.\n\nWeather/operations cross-check: Meteorology + Safety + Infrastructure all point to **freezing fog / very low visibility** and **patchy black ice** risk mainly 04:30–09:00. On a normal instructional day this would more often produce a **delay** than a full closure in Michigan, unless freezing drizzle/ice accretion verifies as widespread. Power-grid risk is negligible.\n\nRecommendation: Treat Feb 16 as **already closed (Mid-Winter Break)**. If you are instead asking the counterfactual “would weather have closed school if it were in session,” the probability would be much lower (~10–20%) with a higher likelihood of a **1–2 hour delay** due to visibility/patchy glaze.",
