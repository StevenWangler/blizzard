  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorologist: Classic cold rain event, temps near/above freezing, no snow or ice storm; very low snow‑day risk.\n  • Historian: Analog events (steady rain, 31–38°F, gusty but non-damaging winds) produce closures only ~2–5% of the time; pattern does NOT match historical snow/ice closure setups.\n  • Safety analyst: Roads mostly wet with only isolated slick spots on bridges/untreated surfaces; explicitly says conditions do not warrant a snow day, only maybe minor delays if unexpected icing appears.\n  • News & community intel: No Rockford or neighboring district announcements for Thursday; media highlight late‑Thursday‑night/Friday flash-freeze risk, not Thursday morning.\n  → All four align on: **Thursday is a wet, somewhat unpleasant but operational school day.**\n\n- Disagreement:\n  • Only slight tension: safety tool flags “moderate” ice-formation risk vs. meteorologist’s view that significant icing is unlikely. This is resolved by timing and temps: pavement and air hover just above freezing with a warming trend, so any icy spots are localized, not system-wide.\n  • No expert suggests more than very low closure probability for Thursday itself.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- There is effectively **no plow event**: total snow = 0\", precipitation type = rain.\n- Road work is mainly drainage and perhaps light salting on bridges.\n- Worst conditions per safety analyst: 6:00–18:00 on Thursday, overlapping but not overwhelming the commute.\n- By the main bus window (~6:30–8:00 AM), temps are ~33–37°F and rising, so any marginal pre‑dawn slickness is easing, not worsening.\n- Hours from “end of snow” to 7:40 AM is not applicable because **there is no snow**, making snow-related plow timing a non-factor.\n\n3. ICE CONSIDERATION\n- Meteorology: temps briefly 30–33°F pre‑dawn, then quickly rise into mid–upper 30s during the commute; all modeled precip is rain, no freezing rain.\n- Safety: calls ice-formation risk “moderate” but in context describes *isolated* slick spots where drainage is poor or on elevated surfaces, not a glaze event.\n- Historically, Michigan districts rarely cancel for scattered wet/icy patches when air temps are rising above freezing and main roads are treated.\n- Conclusion: **No broad ice event**; just routine West Michigan wet/slippery conditions. That keeps us well below the 60–85% “8+ inches OR ice” threshold.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Kent ISD, and other nearby districts all show **no preemptive closures or delays** for Thursday.\n- No early-dismissal history or special Thursday warnings.\n- Media and community chatter are focused on possible **Friday** issues from a flash freeze, not Thursday.\n- Per the decision rules, we only bump probabilities upward if 3+ neighbors close or community strongly expects closure; here, neither is true, so **no upward adjustment** from news intel.\n\n5. NUMERIC PROBABILITY AND WEIGHTING\nBase inputs by expert weight:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Pattern is explicitly “very low snow-day risk”; translate to ~5%.\n- Safety (25% weight): States conditions do not warrant a snow day; only mentions possible localized delays if surprise icing occurs; assign ~8% to account for that tail risk.\n- History (20% weight): Analog closure rate 2–5%; take ~3%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): Zero closure signals + focus on Friday; gives ~5% chance for an unexpected administrative decision.\n\nWeighted estimate:\n- 0.35×5% = 1.75\n- 0.25×8% = 2.00\n- 0.20×3% = 0.60\n- 0.20×5% = 1.00\nTotal ≈ 5.35%, rounded to **6%** for clarity.\n\nThis 6% sits comfortably inside the Michigan guideline for **<4\" snow (5–15%)**, and we’re at the very low end because there is **no snow at all** and only marginal ice risk. There are no neighboring closures to add the +15–20% bump. There’s also no conflicting data that would justify moving into the 15–35% range.\n\n6. WHAT COULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main pathways to being wrong (a surprise closure) are:\n- An unmodeled **flash freeze arriving earlier** than expected—e.g., temps plunging and roads glazing over during or just before the Thursday morning commute, rather than late at night.\n- A **major power outage** or localized infrastructure failure (drainage/urban flooding) not directly forecast by current guidance.\n- A **policy-driven decision** (e.g., district over-caution because of Friday’s forecast) that leads to an unexpected closure despite manageable conditions.\nAll of these are low-probability relative to the current, consistent signal from all four expert domains.\n\nGiven the strong consensus, the absence of snow/ice, and no neighboring closures, a **6% snow-day probability** with **high confidence** is appropriate and should deliver a solid Brier score against the actual likely outcome (school open).",
