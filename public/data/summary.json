  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology: Clear, dry to mostly dry day with only a tiny evening dusting; no accumulating snow for the overnight or morning commute; temps in upper teens–20s°F, wind chills single digits. Concludes near‑0% chance of a weather closure.\n- History: Mid‑December cold, cloudy, breezy, with flurries/dusting is a very common pattern. Historical snow‑day rates for similar setups are about 1–5%, with schools almost always open. Emphasizes that closures historically come from 8\"+ snow, ice storms, or extreme wind chills (≈‑15°F or colder), none of which apply.\n- Safety: Primary roads rated 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10, walking/driving conditions 7–8/10, risk level ‘low’. Worst conditions window (00:00–08:00) still only poses minimal morning and afternoon commute impact. Recommends normal operations.\n- News/Intel: No official closure or delay hints from Rockford Public Schools, Kent ISD, or neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville). Media coverage describes typical, nuisance‑level winter conditions, not a major Monday event. Community sentiment: no surge of ‘this is a big storm’ talk; early‑winter has been active, but Monday the 15th is not singled out.\nAll four experts essentially align: this is a routine cold winter day with no active storm during the school window and very low closure likelihood. There are no meaningful conflicts that need tool clarification.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total snow into Monday morning: effectively 0\"; only about 0.02\" as a brief dusting late evening, after school.\n- Snow end vs. start of school: There is no pre‑commute plow event; roads going into Monday morning are dry or just carrying residual from previous days, which crews have ample time to clear well before 7:40 AM.\n- Hours from any light evening snow to next relevant travel: The trace dusting appears after 9–11 PM and is so minimal it doesn’t constitute a plow‑timing problem.\nConclusion: Plow timing is a non‑issue; there is no overnight accumulation to race against.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology shows cold and dry for commute windows with no freezing rain signal.\n- Safety notes only ‘moderate’ general ice formation risk due to cold pavement (meaning isolated slick spots on bridges/shade), not a systemic ice event.\n- History: Major closure‑driving ice storms are absent from this forecast pattern.\nTherefore, there is no meaningful ice storm or glazing event; only routine patchy slick spots that Michigan districts operate in regularly.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news signals\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) list Dec 15 as a normal school day, no special weather notes.\n- Kent ISD emphasizes coordinated early‑morning decisions but gives no indication of planning for a mass closure around this date.\n- Local media and NWS discussions reference typical light snow/mix and cold, not a high‑impact Monday storm.\n- Social media/community sentiment is ‘uncertain’ but not strongly pushing for closure or predicting one.\nPer the competition rules, there is no basis for a +15–20% bump for neighboring closures or a +10–15% bump for strong community closure expectations. If anything, the lack of buzz leans toward the low end.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis & weighting\nWeights: Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News/Intel 20%.\n- Meteorology implies a closure probability ~1% (effectively 0, but allow tiny residual for non‑weather factors).\n- Safety, given low risk and high road scores, suggests ~2–3% (primarily for unexpected isolated incidents).\n- History shows 1–5% for similar patterns; we take ~3% mid‑range.\n- News/Intel, with no closure hints and no domino effect, also leans ~2–3%.\nWeighted blend: roughly (0.35*1) + (0.25*3) + (0.20*3) + (0.20*3) ≈ 2–3%. No upward adjustments from neighboring closures or community pressure; Michigan threshold rules indicate <4\" with no active storm is normally 5–15%, but this event is even weaker than a typical <4\" event (essentially 0\"), so we stay slightly below that band. To avoid underestimating non‑weather anomalies, I set the final value at 2% instead of 0–1%.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A major, last‑minute forecast bust: unexpected lake‑effect band or clipper dropping several inches (4–8\"+) of snow focused squarely on Kent County between ~3–7 AM Monday.\n- Surprising ice: an unmodeled warm‑layer intrusion producing freezing drizzle or freezing rain overnight, turning roads into a glaze by 5–7 AM.\n- Non‑weather infrastructure failures: widespread power outages, major bus fleet issues, or a significant accident blocking key routes.\nThese are all low‑probability contingencies, but they account for the small non‑zero 2% estimate.\n\nGiven the strong consensus, extremely light/absent precip, and Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter cold, the best calibrated forecast is that school runs on a normal schedule with a very small chance of a last‑minute non‑routine issue.",
