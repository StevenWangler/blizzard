    "No accumulating snow/precip forecast for Wed (0\"), light winds, and no active NWS alerts in the provided forecast—Michigan typically stays open in this setup",
    "Primary risk is *not snow* but a post-icing/refreeze + mist/freezing-fog window near bus time (roughly 6:30–9:30 AM), which can create patchy black ice and localized low visibility",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays found in the latest sweep; community sentiment shows “no buzz,” which usually correlates with schools staying open",
    "Road-clearing capacity is not the limiter (roads generally reported/assessed as passable); concern is localized slick bridges/overpasses, rural low spots, and parking lots/bus loops",
    "Power-grid risk appears minimal (Consumers systemwide outages extremely low), so outages are unlikely to drive a closure"

  "decision_rationale": "Integrating all inputs, the base case is an OPEN day for Rockford with heightened caution for a narrow morning hazard window. Meteorology indicates a cold, dry Wednesday with no accumulating snow and light wind—normally a near-certain “open” outcome in West Michigan. History and Safety both elevate risk due to antecedent freezing rain/freezing drizzle potential Tuesday plus a hard overnight refreeze into ~2°F, and the forecast includes mist/freezing-fog signals around the morning commute; that combination can produce patchy black ice and sudden visibility drops. However, News Intel finds no confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays and no Rockford weather announcement (beyond the scheduled Early Release), and Power Grid analysis shows negligible outage risk—both reduce the likelihood of a districtwide closure.\n\nKey uncertainty: the Web Weather Verifier flagged a ≤-20°F wind chill on a questionable/stale Weather.com variant. Under the extreme-cold rule, *any credible* ≤-20°F during 6–8 AM would force a 90–95% closure call. Here, the only ≤-20°F values came from a low-reliability, stale/locale-mismatched page, while other sources (WeatherAPI and an NWS-style text forecast) imply wind chills closer to about +7°F to -8°F. The meteorologist follow-up does not support extreme wind chills. Therefore, I do NOT trigger the automatic extreme-cold closure rule, but I keep confidence at “moderate” because if true wind chills were dramatically colder than the point forecast (or if widespread glazing is observed), decision-making could shift quickly.\n\nBottom line: closure is unlikely; the more realistic operational outcome (not asked for in the probability) is a 2-hour delay if early road checks find widespread glare ice or dense fog across multiple zones.",
