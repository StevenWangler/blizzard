    "Temperatures cold enough for refreeze and slick spots but not near extreme-cold closure thresholds.",
    "Historical analogs for similar late‑November storms in West Michigan show schools usually open on the following Monday, with closures more tied to active Monday-morning snowfall or 8–10\"+ plus drifting during the commute."

  "decision_rationale": "Using the Michigan-specific thresholds and the provided expert analyses:\n\n1. **Snow amounts vs Michigan norms**\n- Forecast weekend totals: **6–9\"+**, with about **4.3\"** centered around midnight–4 AM Sunday.\n- For Michigan, 4–6\" typically corresponds to only **15–35%** closure odds, and even 6–8\" only reaches **35–50%** when timing is bad (i.e., active during the commute). Here, the worst timing is **Saturday PM–early Sunday**, not Monday.\n\n2. **Timing relative to school operations**\n- Heavy snow ends by roughly **4–5 AM Sunday**, with only mist/freezing fog after that.\n- Sunday daylight is mainly dry with some sun and temps into the **mid‑30s°F**, which supports **effective cleanup**.\n- Road crews then have **all day Sunday and Sunday night** to clear and widen roads, treat major intersections, and handle parking lots.\n- By the **Monday 5–8 AM window**, no ongoing snow, no fog, and no major wind/visibility issues are indicated.\n\n3. **Road and safety assessment**\n- Safety tool scores (1 = worst, 5 = best): primary roads **5**, secondary **4**, parking lots **4**, walking **4**, driving **4**. That’s consistent with **manageable but slick** conditions, not widespread impassable roads.\n- **Ice risk is high** due to overnight refreeze, but that is a routine winter hazard in West Michigan and normally addressed with salting and caution, not system‑wide closure.\n\n4. **Historical pattern context**\n- Pattern analogs show snow day rates of **~40%, 25%, and 15%** for similar storms, but Rockford tends to close only when:\n  - The storm is ongoing into the **Monday commute**; or\n  - Totals exceed **8–10\"** with active drifting; or\n  - There’s **ice/extreme cold**. \n- Here, snow is mainly **weekend**, drifting is modest (gusts low 20s mph, not a blizzard), and there is **no major ice-storm or extreme-cold component**.\n- Seasonal adjustment explicitly suggests **less likelihood of closure** (-0.1 in the historical assessment).\n\n5. **Why not lower or higher than 22%?**\n- Not near 5–10% because:\n  - Totals are relatively high (6–9\"+),\n  - There is **high ice risk** on untreated surfaces and rural/hilly routes often stay worse longer,\n  - The Winter Storm Watch language (“difficult to potentially impossible travel during the height of the storm”) sometimes nudges superintendents to be cautious if cleanup underperforms.\n- Not as high as 30–35% because:\n  - No active Monday-morning snow, fog, or high winds;\n  - Primary and most secondary roads are expected to be in **good** shape by Monday morning;\n  - Historical practice in Kent County is to **run school** after a weekend event like this unless something goes notably wrong.\n\nSynthesizing meteorology, history, and safety, the most defensible, Brier-score-conscious estimate is that Rockford Public Schools are **much more likely to be open than closed** on Monday, December 1, 2025. I set the final snow day probability at **22%**: low but not negligible, reflecting some residual risk from refreeze and rural roads rather than active storm conditions.",
