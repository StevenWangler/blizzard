    "No accumulating snow expected; this is not a plowable event (0\" forecast)",
    "Freezing fog around the 6–8 AM bus window with temps near 30–31°F creates patchy black-ice risk (bridges/overpasses/shaded rural roads) and reduced visibility",
    "Warming trend after mid-morning should improve conditions; afternoon impacts minimal",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closure domino signals and no Rockford weather announcement as of Wed evening",
    "No widespread power-outage signal; grid risk appears low (but outage reporting has data gaps)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on a low closure probability (debate consensus ~15%) because there is no forecast snowfall/ice storm and winds/cold are not near Michigan extreme-cold closure thresholds. The single meaningful school-impact hazard is freezing fog during the morning bus window: it can abruptly lower visibility and create thin, patchy glaze/black ice on untreated surfaces (especially bridges and rural connectors) despite minimal measurable precipitation. In Michigan—and specifically mid/late February in West Michigan—this pattern historically results in schools staying open most of the time, with delays occurring more often than full closures when fog becomes dense/widespread. News/community intelligence shows no closure domino effect and no active district messaging; infrastructure and power-grid inputs do not show system-wide failures, though live road-condition and outage detail is limited. Net: recommend OPEN with monitoring, with a realistic but modest tail risk that decision-makers opt for a short delay if dense freezing fog/black ice is observed on early route checks.",
