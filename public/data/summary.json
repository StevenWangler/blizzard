  "decision_rationale": "Cross-checking the experts, there is strong agreement that this is *not* a classic Michigan morning-closure setup: little/no precip overnight, then light-to-moderate snow mainly during school hours with totals around ~1.5–1.6 inches. Infrastructure inputs indicate roads should be mostly passable by 6:30 AM because agencies have an overnight treatment window, and winds are not in a drifting/whiteout regime. The key disagreement is the web-verifier’s internal Weather.com conflict, including one outlier showing feels-like near -26°F; per policy, any credible ≤-20°F during 6–8 AM would force 90–95%. However, the verifier itself flags that page as a likely wrong locale/variant, while the other Weather.com hourly snippet aligns with the API magnitude (upper 20s with teens feels-like). Given the broad expert consensus and lack of any other corroboration for extreme wind chills, I do not apply the extreme-cold closure rule here.\n\nThe realistic pathway to closure is the ‘ice masking’ scenario (Thu freezing drizzle/freezing rain residue + overnight refreeze) creating *widespread* slick secondary roads and bus turnarounds at 6–8 AM. Safety analysis clarifies that with temps holding ~29–31°F and no strong flash-freeze signal, black ice risk is more likely isolated (bridges, shaded/rural connectors, untreated neighborhood streets/parking lots) than district-wide—more consistent with an OPEN decision, possibly with operational mitigations, or at most a 2-hour delay if early route scouts find widespread slickness.\n\nNews intelligence provides an important tiebreaker: as of the latest check, FOX 17’s closings feed shows no active closings/delays and there are no date-specific posts from Rockford or nearby districts. That reduces the domino-effect pressure that often pushes borderline calls toward closure.\n\nNet: full closure is unlikely but not negligible due to the ice wildcard. Best Brier-score calibration in Michigan is to stay decisively below 30% for a light, post-start event absent confirmed ice/closures—so 22% is the center of mass.",
