  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • All four inputs agree Rockford is on the lighter/advisory edge of a stronger storm focused west and northwest (Muskegon/Oceana, lakeshore counties).\n  • Expected storm total near Rockford is in the 3–5\" range, not 8\"+.\n  • Steadier accumulating snow peaks Monday evening through very early Tuesday (~midnight–4/5 AM), then shuts off or becomes non-accumulating mist/fog by the 6–8 AM commute.\n  • Winds are modest; no blizzard or whiteout signal inland by bus time.\n  • Roads will be slick but largely plowed on primaries by morning; secondaries and parking lots will be messy but not generally impassable.\n  • No rain or mixed precip flag in the meteorological or historical data; temps stay in the 20s–near 30°F.\n  • Historically and operationally in Michigan, this setup more often leads to school operating on time (or with a possible delay) than a full closure.\n  • News intel and regional closing forecasts explicitly state that the Grand Rapids/Rockford corridor is unlikely to see widespread school closings, with closures more likely closer to the lakeshore.\n\n- DISAGREEMENTS / TENSIONS:\n  • Safety assessment lists ice_formation_risk as \"high\" due to subfreezing temps and compacted snow on untreated surfaces, while meteorology shows no pure ice event (no freezing rain, no warm-up/flash-freeze). This is a difference in wording: the safety expert is highlighting black-ice patches on bridges/side streets, not a region-wide glazing storm.\n  • Meteorologist gives full-closure probability ~25–35% with delay odds 35–45%. Historical data for similar patterns shows a 20–30% closure rate. News intel implies even lower odds because forecasts and media are signaling that GR/Rockford are outside the main closure zone.\n  • Community sentiment is described as uncertain, not strongly convinced of closure; there is no strong crowd expectation to push probabilities upward.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions end time from safety analyst: ~05:00 EST Tuesday.\n- Typical first bus / start-of-operations window: ~6:00–7:40 AM.\n- That gives roughly 1–2.5 hours of no new accumulation before the earliest buses, and closer to 2–3+ hours before the final arrivals.\n- Overnight crews in Kent County are experienced with exactly this scenario. With 3–5\" total and snow ending before the commute, primaries and major bus routes are very likely to be plowed/salted at least once, leaving them slushy but passable. Secondary roads and parking lots will be the weak link but still generally navigable with caution.\n- This timing favors either normal operations or, at most, a short delay if plows lag in specific neighborhoods—consistent with both the meteorologist and safety analyst.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: all precip is snow; temps remain at or below freezing with no warm layer aloft and no above-freezing surface temps to create melt-refreeze or freezing rain. No explicit ice storm or mixed-precip signature.\n- Safety: \"high\" ice formation risk is due to:\n  • Subfreezing pavement temperatures.\n  • Packed snow leading to polished/icy spots, especially on bridges/overpasses, hills, and untreated side streets.\n  • This is localized black ice risk, not a region-wide glaze.\n- Given the Michigan thresholds, this does NOT qualify as an \"ice event\" that automatically pushes into the 60–85% closure band. It is standard winter slickness that districts are accustomed to managing, not a transformational hazard like a freezing rain storm.\n\n4. Neighboring district status\n- News intelligence is clear:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: no pre-announced closure or delay.\n  • Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): no closure/delay announcements; all appear to be planning normal operations.\n  • TV closing lists are not flagging Kent County as an area of expected widespread closures.\n- This means:\n  • 0 neighboring districts are confirmed closed.\n  • No +15–20% adjustment from neighboring-district closures.\n  • Media forecasting pieces specifically say the GR/Rockford area snow is “very unlikely to cause school closings.” That is a strong negative signal for closures.\n\n5. Base probability using Michigan thresholds\n- Expected snow in Rockford: ~3–5\" total (split between Monday and early Tuesday), with about 1.8\" new in the late-night period. That is near the low end of the 4–6\" band, not a storm-total 8\"+ event.\n- Timing: heaviest snow overnight, tapering before the core bus window.\n- No major wind, no pure ice, no blizzard conditions.\n- Using the provided Michigan thresholds:\n  • <4\" → 5–15%.\n  • 4–6\" → 15–35%.\n  • We are around the boundary of those two, but operationally closer to a routine advisory event than a high-impact one.\n\n6. Weighting the four expert domains\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Characterizes this as a “difficult commute” but not a slam-dunk snow day.\n  • Gives full-closure probability 25–35%.\n  • I anchor the meteorological contribution near 30%.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Labels risk as moderate, with roads slick but passable and specific concern for bridges, secondaries, and walking conditions.\n  • States conditions favor regular or possibly short delay rather than a full snow day.\n  • I interpret this as roughly 20–30% closure odds; I center safety contribution around 25%.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Analog patterns show 20–30% closure rates.\n  • Seasonal adjustment actually nudges probability slightly down because such events are common and usually handled without closures.\n  • I set the historical contribution at ~22%.\n\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon):\n  • Forecast articles explicitly say closures are unlikely for the GR/Rockford corridor.\n  • No neighboring district closures, no strong community expectation of a snow day.\n  • This should pull probabilities down within the threshold band, not up.\n  • I set the news-intel contribution at ~10–15%; I’ll use 12% as a working value.\n\nWeighted blend (approximate):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 × 30% ≈ 10.5\n- Safety: 0.25 × 25% ≈ 6.25\n- History: 0.20 × 22% ≈ 4.4\n- News intel: 0.20 × 12% ≈ 2.4\n- Sum ≈ 23.5%.\n\nGiven the explicit Michigan threshold guidance (4–6\" → 15–35%) and the strong negative signal from news intel and neighbors (no closings expected here), I round slightly downward for calibration, to 22%.\n\n7. Why not higher?\n- We do NOT have:\n  • 8\"+ focused directly on Rockford.\n  • Ongoing heavy snow during the entire bus window.\n  • Blowing/drifting with whiteouts.\n  • A true ice storm.\n  • Multiple neighboring districts already announcing closures.\n- Instead, we have:\n  • Advisory-level totals, mainly overnight.\n  • Several plow hours before buses.\n  • Media and forecast messaging that specifically downplays closure odds in this corridor.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside closure risk (our 22% is too low) if:\n  • A persistent lake-effect band parks over Rockford/Kent County through 4–8 AM, pushing local totals near or above ~8\" right at commute time.\n  • Plowing or salting underperforms (equipment issues, staffing, band placement) so that secondaries and hills are much worse than usual for a 3–5\" event.\n  • An unmodeled sleet/freezing-drizzle component briefly adds a thin glaze on top of the snow near dawn (not currently indicated).\n\n- Downside risk (our 22% is too high) if:\n  • The heavier bands stay entirely west/northwest, and Rockford verifies closer to 2–3\" total with very light overnight rates.\n  • Road crews clear everything efficiently and early, leaving only minor slick spots.\n\nGiven all four expert domains and the Michigan context, a 22% closure probability reflects a low but nontrivial chance that something over-performs (band stalls, plows lag) but keeps us well out of the midrange, in line with both history and current real-time signals.",
