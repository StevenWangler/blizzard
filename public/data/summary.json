  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorology: Very cold, effectively dry, no accumulating snow or ice Sunday into Monday, winds modest, visibility mostly fine aside from patchy freezing fog.\n  • History: This pattern (cold, dry, high pressure; maybe some residual slickness) almost never yields a snow day in Rockford; typical closure triggers (8+\" snow, ice storm, or extreme wind chills) are absent.\n  • Safety: Roads are rated good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, lots/parking 8/10). Risk level is explicitly \"low\" with normal winter precautions recommended. Morning and afternoon commute impacts both flagged as \"minimal.\"\n  • News/Intel: No official closure or delay announcements for Rockford or nearby districts; local coverage mentions a wintry pattern but no specific high-impact storm tied to Monday morning.\nAll four agree that conditions favor normal operations, not a closure.\n\n- Disagreement:\n  • There is essentially no substantive conflict. Meteorology, history, and safety are aligned on low impact. News intel notes some regional slickness and an overall wintry pattern, but does not contradict the low-risk assessment for Monday; it just cautions to watch for any late changes.\n  • The only small nuance: safety notes a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk due to refreeze/black ice, but still scores driving conditions highly and labels the overall risk low. That nuance does not rise to closure-level concern, only to enhanced caution.\nBecause there are no meaningful conflicts, extra tool calls for resolution are not needed.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- No new snow is forecast on Sunday or overnight into Monday; total new accumulation is 0.0\".\n- Prior light snow/ice was on Friday and perhaps early Saturday, giving road crews roughly 24–36 hours of cleanup before the Monday commute.\n- With clear, cold, dry conditions on Sunday, crews have ample time for salting and any necessary plowing well before early-morning bus routes.\n- By around 5:00–7:40 AM Monday (typical bus window for Rockford), roads are expected to be cold but generally clear, with only isolated refreeze slick spots on bridges and side streets.\nPlow timing is therefore strongly favorable to having school: there is effectively nothing fresh to plow.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Forecast: No active freezing rain, drizzle, or mixed precip; precipitation probability is 0 overnight and in the morning.\n- The noted ice risk is from refreeze/black ice, enhanced by very cold pavement and some freezing fog/mist pockets. This is a routine winter hazard in West Michigan and is mitigated with standard salting, especially on known trouble spots.\n- There is no indication of widespread glaze ice or power issues, which are the kinds of ice events that push districts into 60–85%+ closure territory.\nConclusion: Some patchy black ice is possible, but there is no storm-driven ice event that would \"change everything.\"\n\n4. Neighboring district status & community signals\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no posted closures or delays for Monday, Dec. 15, 2025.\n- There is no evidence of 3+ neighboring districts closing, so there is no +15–20% upward adjustment per the rules.\n- Community/social-media style information is described as \"uncertain\" rather than strongly expecting a snow day, and local outlets are not hyping a major storm for Monday.\nGiven the guidance that community expectation can raise the probability, the lack of strong buzz actually reinforces keeping the probability at the low end.\n\n5. Weighting the four expert domains\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates low risk: 0\" new snow, no ice, no storm, steady subfreezing temps but not dangerously low wind chills. This strongly pulls the probability toward the 0–5% range.\n- Safety (25% weight): Labels overall risk \"low,\" with high road-condition scores and \"minimal\" commute impacts. Explicitly says there is no justification for closure or delay given the current forecast. This supports a very small probability, again in the low single digits.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs for similar setups show ~5–10% closure rates, and those often include slightly worse snow/ice than is forecast here. Given that this pattern is on the milder end (no new precip), history supports a probability near or even below the 5% lower bound of those analogs.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight): Confirms no active closure talk, no neighboring districts announcing closures, and no major storm being tied to Monday. The wintry pattern alone does not justify an upward adjustment. Since community sentiment is not “this will definitely be a snow day,” we do not apply the +10–15% expectation bump.\nCombined, a weighted blend would reasonably land near 3–6%. Because Michigan’s baseline tolerance is high and *all* concrete signals are pointing toward a normal day, I choose the lower end of this range: 4%.\n\n6. Alignment with Michigan-specific thresholds\n- New snow: 0\" (well below the <4\" band that already only yields 5–15% in Michigan). This pushes probability toward the bottom of the scale.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, and winds are moderate.\n- Wind chills: Cold but not at common closure triggers (-15°F to -20°F or worse at bus time).\n- No multi-district closures or advisories suggesting system-wide travel disruption.\nWithin the stated Michigan thresholds, this setup is below even the mildest typical closure scenario, reinforcing a very low percentage, not midrange ambiguity.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes that could invalidate this 4% estimate are:\n- A surprise, unmodeled event: e.g., a last-minute clipper or lake-effect band intensifies overnight, dropping several inches of poorly timed snow before 6–7 AM.\n- A more serious ice/fog issue than forecast: widespread freezing drizzle or dense freezing fog creates unexpected, severe black ice that road commissions cannot treat in time.\n- A sharp downward swing in temperatures or wind chills (e.g., actual bus-time wind chills plunging below -20°F and prompting a cold-related closure decision).\n- Administrative caution based on localized incidents: a series of morning crashes or bus-route issues leading Rockford and neighboring districts to close even without a major storm.\nNone of these appear likely in the current data, but they are the reasons to monitor updates.\n\n8. Final decision\nGiven the strong consensus across meteorology, safety, history, and news intel, and the absence of any significant conflicting indicators, the most reasonable final prediction is a very low chance of a snow day: 4%.\nThat implies schools should plan for normal operations with routine cold-weather and black-ice precautions, while still checking early-morning conditions in case of one of the low-probability failure scenarios above.",
