  "decision_rationale": "1. AGREEMENTS AMONG EXPERTS\n- Meteorology, history, safety, and news intel all align that this is a warm, rainy, non‑winter‑storm setup.\n- Temperatures: All sources indicate temps solidly above freezing (mid‑40s to around 50°F) during the overnight through morning commute and school day.\n- Precipitation type: 100% rain, no accumulating snow, and no freezing rain during school hours.\n- Impacts: Wet roads, some ponding, reduced visibility at times, and breezy winds—none of which reach typical closure thresholds in Michigan.\n- Historical context: Similar warm‑sector rain events in January almost never produce snow days in West Michigan.\n- Local signals: No district announcements, no neighboring closures, no outage reports, and no community “this will be bad” buzz.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\n- There are no material conflicts. The safety analyst labels risk level as “moderate,” but the narrative explicitly supports normal operations with caution for wet roads and visibility. This is compatible with the meteorologist’s \"very low\" closure probability and the historian’s ~1–3% historical closure rate.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM WORST CONDITIONS TO 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window: roughly 12:00 AM–8:30 AM (steady to heavy rain, some thunder, breezy winds).\n- By 7:40 AM (typical first‑bell/bus arrival window), rain is ongoing but temps are in the upper‑40s°F, with roads wet but not icy.\n- Because there is no snow and minimal ice risk, traditional plow timing (snow removal, drifting) is essentially irrelevant. Road crews mainly deal with drainage; that is already in place and does not require pre‑dawn clearing like a snowstorm would.\n- Functional conclusion: There is no plow‑clearance constraint between precip end and school start; buses run on wet roads, not through new accumulation.\n\n4. ICE RISK (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Forecast: 0 freezing hours during the significant precip window, overnight low near 41°F, and a rising temperature trend into the morning.\n- Meteorologist notes the earlier Special Weather Statement for Jan 8 (patchy morning icing), but explicitly states that by Jan 9, hazards shift to heavy rain/ponding, not ice.\n- Safety analyst: “ice_formation_risk: low” and supports normal operations.\n- Conclusion: No evidence of widespread ice or freezing rain. This is the key factor keeping the probability very low.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD: none show Jan 9 closures or delays as of the evening before.\n- No early event cancellations and no power‑outage clusters.\n- Per your weighting rules, there is no +15–20% bump because there are not 3+ neighboring closures; in fact, the absence of closures supports staying at the lower end of probabilities.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\n- A surprising overnight shift to substantially colder air than forecast, turning rain to freezing rain or wet snow before or during the morning commute.\n- Unexpected localized flooding that becomes significantly worse than modeled, closing key routes or making bus turn‑arounds unsafe.\n- Infrastructure problems such as widespread power outages or downed trees from thunderstorms or non‑forecast stronger winds.\n- Current data from all four experts show none of these as likely; they are low‑probability tail risks.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH YOUR SPECIFIED WEIGHTS)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Meteorologist explicitly gives ~5% closure probability and notes temps well above freezing and all‑rain precip. I take this largely at face value for the physical setup.\n- Safety (25%): Safety analyst rates road/commute conditions as manageable with caution and recommends a normal school day. This strongly supports a low closure probability (on the order of 5–10% at most).\n- History (20%): Historical analogs (similar warm January rain events) show 1–3% snow‑day rates. This nudges the estimate slightly below what a naive forecaster might choose if only looking at \"heavy rain\" subjectively.\n- News intelligence (20%): No neighboring closures, no official concern, and community sentiment is essentially “no buzz.” Under your rules, there is no upward adjustment; if anything, this reinforces staying near the floor.\n\nMICHIGAN THRESHOLDS CONTEXT\n- Expected snow: 0\". By your state‑specific thresholds, <4\" snow should put us in 5–15% range, and this case has no snow and no ice.\n- Winds are breezy, not extreme; no blizzard, no ice storm, and no 8\"+ scenario.\n- Therefore, a value at the bottom of the 5–15% band is justified.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- Integrating all four expert domains with your weights, I place Rockford Public Schools’ chance of a weather‑driven snow day (or delay) for Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5%, with high confidence.\n- School is overwhelmingly likely to be open on time, with a wet, somewhat slower commute but no systemic safety reason to cancel.\n\nThis stays safely out of the 40–60% “uncertain” band because expert agreement is strong, the weather pattern is well‑behaved and warm, and local/community signals show no emerging red flags.",
