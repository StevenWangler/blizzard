  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, breezy; 0% snow or freezing rain overnight and through the school day; no alerts.\n- Historian: This setup matches a very common “cold, cloudy, dry school day” with only a few-percent historical closure rate.\n- Safety analyst: Roads generally good (8–9/10), minor refreeze risk only on untreated/ shaded spots; normal operations recommended.\n- News intel: No closure chatter, no advisories for Kent County, no neighboring districts calling off school, Rockford’s own site lists a normal day.\nAll four independently support school being open.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There are no material conflicts. All sources converge on: no new precip, manageable cold, treated roads, and no institutional signals of closure.\n- The only slight nuance is the safety analyst flagging “moderate” ice-formation risk in isolated areas vs. meteorology emphasizing no new precip; these are compatible (residual slick spots from the prior event, not a new storm).\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- The meteorological analysis shows **0% precip** and **0\" snowfall** from midnight through the entire day Monday.\n- The preceding light snow/freezing drizzle occurred on Sunday, giving road crews **overnight and early-morning hours** to finish treatment.\n- By the key start-of-school window (~7:40 AM), road operations will have had **many hours (most of the night)** with no new accumulation.\n- Effectively, plow/salt timing is more than sufficient; we are dealing with cleanup and refreeze, not active snowfall.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- No new freezing rain is forecast; temps are below freezing, so **refreeze is possible**, but:\n  - Safety: Primary roads score 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8.5/10.\n  - Ice risk categorized as **moderate**, localized to untreated spots, bridges, shaded areas, and some sidewalks.\n- This is typical post-event winter driving in Michigan, not a systemic ice storm. There is no indication of widespread glazing that would trigger countywide closures.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, Grand Rapids Public Schools:\n  - **No pre-announced closures or delays** for Monday.\n  - FOX 17 closings page: **zero active school closings or delays** in West Michigan.\n- This strongly indicates a normal-operation expectation across the region. Under the competition rules, no +15–20% adjustment is applied because 3+ neighboring districts are NOT closed.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\nMain ways this prediction could fail:\n- An unexpected overnight freezing drizzle or black ice event far worse than current guidance, producing widespread, invisible ice on rural routes.\n- A late, unforecast band of lake-effect snow setting up directly over Kent County with several inches falling during the 4–7 AM window.\n- A surprise wind-chill or infrastructure issue (e.g., major power outages) not indicated in current data.\nAll of these require **substantial last-minute forecast changes** or emergent hazards; none are supported by the present analyses.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  - Key findings: 0% precip, 0\" snow, cold but not extreme, no alerts.\n  - This alone implies a very low closure probability, on the order of a few percent.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  - Low risk; roads 8–9/10; explicitly states a snow day or delay is **not warranted**.\n  - Supports a similarly low probability.\n- History (20% weight):\n  - Analog patterns show **2–5%** closure rates for this setup, with high confidence.\n- News intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon):\n  - No closures listed anywhere; Rockford’s own site shows a normal school day; no advisory for Kent County; no social-media or news buzz.\n  - This strongly reinforces the low end of the range, with **no positive adjustment** (no neighboring closures, no community expectation of a snow day).\n\nSYNTHESIS AND NUMERICAL DECISION\n- Base Michigan threshold guidance: With **<4\" of new snow** (here, actually 0\"), the generic range is **5–15%**.\n- Our situation is even more benign than a typical light-snow scenario: no precip at all, just residual slick spots.\n- Historical analogs: ~2–5%.\n- Safety and news both argue **against** closure.\n- There are no offsetting factors like extreme cold, blizzard conditions, or systemic ice.\n\nCombining these with the specified weights and aiming for a decisive forecast with good Brier performance, I set the **final snow day probability at 3%**. This reflects a realistic but very small chance that unforecast icing or a surprise band leads to an early-morning closure decision, while aligning tightly with all available evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n- Conditions for Monday, Dec. 15, 2025 in Rockford, MI strongly favor **normal school operations**.\n- Probability of a snow day: **3%**.\n- Confidence: **very high**, because all four expert domains independently converge on the same outcome with no substantive conflicts.",
