    "No accumulating snow or active precipitation forecast for Mon 2/23 during bus/commute hours (0.0\"), with good visibility and no NWS alerts in the provided data",
    "Wind chills around ~9–12°F at bus time are cold but well above Michigan’s dangerous closure thresholds (no ≤ -20°F signal from any retrieved credible source)",
    "Infrastructure view: roads expected already clear; no plow operations needed—only spot-treatment risk for bridges/shaded back roads if refreeze occurs",
    "News/decision signals are quiet: no confirmed neighboring-district closure domino effect on local closings pages; Rockford-specific closure messaging not present",
    "Power grid supportive: low and decreasing outages systemwide; no evidence of a Kent County outage event that would force closure"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, power, and news intel, the shared baseline is a cold but dry Monday with no meaningful snow/ice expected and no active closure “domino” signals. That combination almost always yields a normal school day in West Michigan. The only non-zero pathway to disruption is a ‘hangover’ refreeze: if there is residual moisture/untreated glazing from prior days, isolated black ice could appear on bridges, shaded residential streets, and rural bus-route segments between ~5–9 AM. However, neither the forecast nor infrastructure/news signals suggest widespread icing, and power reliability looks normal. I’m therefore keeping the probability low but not zero: ~7% for a full snow day closure (with a slightly higher chance of minor delays/slow routes if spotty ice is observed on early route checks).",
