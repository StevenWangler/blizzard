    "Rockford Public Schools is already officially CLOSED on Mon 2026-02-16 for Mid Winter Break (calendar closure confirmed on the district website/news post)",
    "No accumulating snow/ice forecast (0\"), no winter headlines/alerts in the meteorological input; only fog/mist and possible patchy refreeze",
    "Road clearing not a limiting factor (no plow cycle needed; roads reported clear with only localized slick-spot risk)",
    "Power grid risk is low (only small, scattered outages reported; no ice loading or high-wind outage setup)",
    "Wind chill is not in the extreme-cold closure range (no credible ≤ -20°F wind chill signal for 6–8 AM)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "For Rockford Public Schools specifically, the practical outcome is not forecast-dependent: multiple official district sources state RPS is closed Monday, Feb 16, 2026 for Mid Winter Break (school resumes Tuesday, Feb 17). Therefore the probability that there is no school is 100%, with very high confidence.\n\nSeparately (for weather-only decision quality): all experts converged on a very low *weather-driven* closure likelihood (~2–3%) because there is no snow/ice accumulation expected and winds/cold do not meet Michigan closure thresholds. The only operational hazard is overnight fog/mist with temps in the mid-20s, which can create localized black ice and reduced visibility—more consistent with minor slowdowns or a possible delay if early route checks verify widespread slick spots, not a full cancellation. Web verification did not show any credible ≤ -20°F wind chill during 6–8 AM, and power/infrastructure conditions do not introduce additional closure pressure.",
