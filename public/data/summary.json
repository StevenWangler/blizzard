  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, no new snow or ice Sunday into Monday; normal winter conditions, no reason for a snow day.\n- Historian: This matches a classic post‑storm, cold and dry pattern with historically very low closure rates (3–8%).\n- Safety Analyst: Road and travel risk rated low; primary and secondary roads and parking lots largely in good shape; only localized slick spots expected; normal on‑time start recommended.\n- News/Intel: Rockford Public Schools and Forest Hills are already scheduled to be closed for winter break starting Monday 12/22; no active weather‑driven closure chatter or alerts.\n\nAgreement: All four lines of evidence say there is no weather‑based justification for closing school on 12/22. The news intelligence adds that there is not even a regular school day to cancel, because winter break has already begun.\n\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- Possible tension: Safety flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in micro‑spots, but meteorology says no new precip and historian notes that roads are typically fine by Monday after a dry weekend. That is a nuance (localized slick areas), not a contradiction.\n- Overall, all experts converge on: low operational impact, routine winter cold, and pre‑planned calendar closure.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New snow/ice overnight: 0.0\" forecast; precipitation probability 5% or less.\n- This means there is nothing fresh for plows to clear between Sunday evening and Monday morning—just cleanup from Friday’s event, and road commissions have all of Saturday and Sunday.\n- By the school morning window (around 7:40 AM), roads have had ~48+ hours post‑storm with no additional accumulation. Effectively, the \"hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\" is on the order of two days, far exceeding any threshold where plow timing would threaten operations.\n- Safety analysis explicitly notes primary routes in good shape before 6–8 AM; commute impact minimal.\n\n3. ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no new precip, steady subfreezing temps; surfaces remain cold and dry or with old packed snow. No active ice storm or flash‑freeze signature.\n- Safety: \"Ice_formation_risk: moderate\" refers to localized refreeze (meltwater on untreated surfaces, shaded sidewalks, parking lot patches). This is a typical winter concern, managed with pre‑treatment and sanding, not a system‑wide hazard.\n- Historian: Events with similar conditions almost never trigger closures in Michigan; closures correlate with active ice events, not residual patchy slickness.\n- Conclusion: There is no significant regional ice event. Localized slick spots warrant caution and minor mitigation but not a snow day.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford Public Schools: Official calendar shows Monday, Dec 22, 2025 as the first day of winter break; schools are closed by schedule, not by weather.\n- Forest Hills Public Schools: Also on winter break starting Dec 22.\n- Other districts: Available calendars indicate similar break status; importantly, there are no live, date‑specific \"closed due to weather\" alerts for 12/22.\n- Social/media sentiment: Marked as \"no_buzz\"—no chatter about an impending closure, no complaints about extreme road conditions or a major storm on Monday.\n- Under the competition rules, neighbors being closed for break does NOT count as weather‑driven neighboring snow days, so it does not justify boosting the probability.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (MET 35% / SAFETY 25% / HISTORY 20% / NEWS 20%)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly points to normal operating conditions; on its own this suggests something like a 5–10% closure probability for a typical in‑session day.\n- Safety (25%): Labels risk as low, recommends normal on‑time start with minor precautions. This supports being at the very low end of any probability range.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 3–8% for such patterns, high confidence. This anchors us near the bottom of the Michigan thresholds.\n- News/Intel (20%): Critical contextual factor: there is no school day to cancel. Operationally, the probability of a *weather-caused snow day decision* is essentially zero because the day is pre‑closed for break.\n\nPutting these together for a competition prediction: If we were pretending 12/22 were a normal school day, the forecast and history justify a roughly 5–10% snow‑day probability (cold, but no active storm). Given that the calendar closure is non‑meteorological and the task is to forecast a weather‑driven snow day, the best calibrated answer is at the very bottom of that range.\n\nTherefore I set the snow day probability at 5%, with high confidence, because:\n- Weather and safety both signal routine, manageable conditions.\n- Historical closure rates for this pattern are extremely low.\n- News intel confirms no extraordinary circumstances or community pressure that would inflate the odds.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main ways this 5% call could be off:\n- A surprise, poorly modeled event: e.g., an unexpected band of lake‑effect snow or freezing drizzle Sunday night producing several inches or a glaze of ice by dawn.\n- Infrastructure problem: localized power outages or a major water/main or heating failure affecting multiple school buildings, independent of the weather forecast.\n- Policy choice: district leadership opting for an extra day of break labeled as a weather day despite benign conditions (historically rare but not impossible).\n\nNone of these are indicated by current meteorological data, historical context, or news signals; they are low‑probability tail risks. Hence a 5% probability with high confidence is the best Brier‑score‑oriented forecast.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: There is no meteorological justification for a snow day on Monday, December 22, 2025 in Rockford, and in practice the district is already closed for winter break, so no separate snow‑day decision is expected.",
