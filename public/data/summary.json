  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree snowfall amount is not the issue; the hazards are (a) extreme wind chills and (b) flash-freeze/black ice from a brief freezing-rain/mix window. Roads likely ‘passable but slick’ on main routes; neighborhoods/local streets are the concern.\n2) Disagreement: The biggest conflict was wind chill cross-source; web verification resolved it—Weather.com capture was date-mismatched, while NWS point forecast supports wind chills as low as -28°F. Another tension: corridor article mentioning 1–4\" along/west of US-131 vs API ~0.2\"; this appears corridor-wide and not Rockford-specific, so I treat it as a modest upside-risk rather than the base case.\n3) Plow timing math: Worst precip/icing window ~00:00–04:00. From ~04:00 to 07:40 start time is ~3.5 hours. That’s enough for trunklines/arterials to be improved, but not enough (given night staffing + subzero temps reducing salt effectiveness) to expect residential/bus-stop streets to be reliably good by first pickup.\n4) Ice? Yes—credible light freezing rain/drizzle near midnight. Even a light glaze matters because temps plunge and persist below freezing all day.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel could not confirm any Friday closures/delays posted yet across Forest Hills, GRPS, Kentwood, Northview, Cedar Springs, Godwin Heights, Comstock Park.\n6) Power outages: No confirmed significant outage clusters; tool could not verify interactive-map details. I do not add an outage boost.\n7) Wind chill verification: Confirmed by both WeatherAPI hourly and NWS point forecast (≤ -20°F, potentially near -28°F).\n8) What would make me wrong? (a) If roads are better than expected on local streets by 6–7 AM (aggressive sanding/pretreatment + little/no glaze), schools likely open (possibly with indoor recess). (b) If corridor lake-effect produces closer to 1–4\" locally OR glaze is more widespread than expected, closure probability rises sharply.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% (supports extreme cold + small precip), Safety 20% (moderate road risk but not systemic), History 15% (borderline; delays more common), News 15% (no neighbor closures yet—downward pressure), Infrastructure 10% (local roads likely still slick at 6:30—upward pressure), Power 10% (no strong outage signal—neutral), Web verification 5% (confirms ≤ -20°F—upward pressure).\n\nOutcome: With confirmed ≤ -20°F wind chills (a strong closure trigger) but no confirmed neighbor closures and only light precip totals, I land at 45% for a full closure. I would rate a 2-hour delay as slightly more likely than a full closure given expected marginal neighborhood-road conditions and student exposure risk.",
