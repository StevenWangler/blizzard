  "decision_rationale": "All experts are broadly aligned (debate spread ~5%, mean ~11%) that Tuesday morning in Rockford is a low-impact winter commute: temps in the mid-teens with light winds (wind chill ~+10°F), and the hourly forecast shows essentially no measurable precip during 6–8 AM. The only meaningful disagreement is how much to weight the daily ‘light freezing rain’ label versus the dry hourly breakdown. Meteorology and infrastructure both interpret that label as likely a coarse categorization/near-saturation signal with, at most, a low-probability trace freezing drizzle risk—enough to justify monitoring and possible targeted treatment, but not enough to expect a district-wide closure in Michigan. News intelligence finds no confirmed neighboring-district closures and no Rockford closure/delay messaging; that strongly argues against a preemptive closure. Power-grid risk is not a driver here (no verified outage event and forecast QPF is too small for widespread ice-loading), though outage data is not fully verifiable in-session. Net: best Brier-optimized call is ‘open’ with a small tail risk for a last-minute delay if a surprise glaze is observed before buses roll.",
