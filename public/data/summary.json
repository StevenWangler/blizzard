  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree snowfall is minor (~0.2–0.3\") and ends well before the morning commute; the main hazards are (a) a brief freezing-rain window around midnight with refreeze, and (b) dangerous wind chills during bus-stop time. Everyone expects ‘delay’ odds > ‘full closure’ odds.\n2) Disagreement: The only material tension is how widespread the icing becomes (safety labeled ice risk “high,” meteorology notes totals are tiny implying patchy coverage), and whether regional ‘1–4 inches’ lake-effect language is relevant to Rockford (meteorology says low-to-moderate chance a band hits Rockford pre-8 AM).\n3) Plow timing math: Precip ends ~03:00; first bell ~07:40 → ~4 hours 40 minutes for primary-route treatment. That’s typically enough for arterials, not a guarantee for subdivision/rural bus routes.\n4) Any ice? Yes—light freezing rain is indicated near 11 PM–12 AM with rapid cooling afterward. Expected accretion is trace to a few hundredths, but high impact due to deep cold and limited melting.\n5) Neighboring districts: Not a broad confirmed cascade yet, but FOX17 closings page is already heavily populated and Kenowa Hills (Kent County) is listed closed Friday. Forest Hills is only ‘no evening activities’ (not closed). Rockford has no visible closure post yet.\n6) What would make me wrong? (a) If icing is minimal and roads are largely dry/treated by 6 AM, Rockford likely stays open (maybe with precautions). (b) If a lake-effect band shifts into Rockford or icing is more widespread than expected, closure odds jump. (c) If wind chills verify closer to -25 to -30 for multiple hours at 6–9 AM, cold-alone closures become more likely.\n\nWeighting per system: Meteorology (30%) points to low snow but meaningful ice+cold; Safety (20%) emphasizes patchy black ice + cold + reduced salt performance; History (15%) says these setups more often cause delays than full closures unless wind chills are -25 to -30 and/or roads are widely slick; News (15%) adds a real momentum signal (many cancellations; Kenowa Hills closed) but no strong Rockford/neighbor closure cascade.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds: snow amount alone would be ~5–15%, but the wind chill in the -20 to -23 range during the 6–8 AM window and the flash-freeze/black-ice risk raise this into a ‘not favored but plausible’ closure range. The nearby closure signal (Kenowa Hills) bumps it upward, but absence of multiple neighboring district school closures keeps it below 50%.\n\nFinal: 38% for a full snow day (closure/virtual). I would place 2-hour delay odds higher than closure odds, but the requested probability is for a snow day outcome.",
