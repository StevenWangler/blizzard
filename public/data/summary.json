    "Temps and wind chills stay well above freezing during 6–8 AM bus window (no extreme-cold trigger; no freezing rain signal)",
    "Precipitation type is rain with 0\" snowfall expected; no plowable snow and roads should be generally passable by morning",
    "Main hazard window is AFTER school start (refreeze/black ice potential ~1–8 PM), which more often leads to activity cancellations or early dismissal than a full-day closure",
    "No confirmed Rockford PS closure messaging and no verified Friday-morning domino closures from neighboring districts; community buzz minimal/uncertain",
    "Power grid: no evidence of widespread outages now; some risk of localized overnight outages from wind + saturated soils, but not currently a dominant closure driver"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Cross-referencing the six inputs, there is broad agreement on the base case: this is a rain-dominant event with temperatures in the upper 30s to ~40°F during the critical 6–8 AM bus/decision window, and essentially zero snowfall. The Web Weather Verification explicitly finds no source showing ≤ -20°F wind chill (so no automatic extreme-cold closure rule applies), and infrastructure expects wet-pavement operations rather than plowing. News intelligence finds no Rockford PS announcement and no confirmed weather-driven domino closures for Fri 2/20; one nearby district (Northview) appears to have a scheduled day off (reducing domino pressure).\n\nThe main conflict across analyses is the Safety assessment’s “high” ice formation risk versus Meteorology’s “above-freezing morning” outlook. I resolve this by separating *morning operations* from *late-day hazards*: both can be true. With ~1.27\" rain, a late-day temperature drop can create significant black-ice risk for dismissal/after-school travel, but that typically does NOT justify a full-day closure at 5–6 AM unless the freeze arrives earlier than forecast or there are widespread early-morning slick-spot reports. Given the consensus debate average (~15%) and Michigan’s high closure threshold for rain events, the best Brier-optimized call is a low-but-nontrivial probability centered on the tail risks: (1) earlier-than-forecast refreeze on bridges before dawn, (2) dense fog/very poor visibility right at bus time, (3) localized flooding/road closures, or (4) localized overnight outages affecting key school facilities.",
