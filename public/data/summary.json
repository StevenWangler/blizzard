  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: Clearly indicates a cold, dry period Sunday night into the Monday, Dec. 22 commute, with 0\" forecast snowfall, no freezing rain, and good visibility. Meteorological risk for a weather closure is explicitly described as very low.\n- Historian: Finds close analogs to this pattern with snow day rates of about 1–5%, emphasizing that west Michigan almost never cancels for this kind of ‘post-event, cold and quiet’ setup. High confidence that school would normally be in session under these conditions.\n- Safety analyst: Rates risk as low, with primary roads 9/10 and secondary roads and parking lots 8/10, expecting plowed and largely dry pavement for the commute. Only routine black-ice hot spots need attention.\n- News Intelligence: Confirms the strongest non-weather factor: Rockford Public Schools are already scheduled to be closed for Winter Break starting Monday, Dec. 22, 2025. There is no active snow-day style decision; it is a calendar closure. Neighboring districts are also mostly entering break, with no specific Monday weather-driven closure chatter.\n\nAll four perspectives agree there is no significant storm, no major safety concern, and no unusual operational stress on that Monday. The only ‘closure’ signal is the planned winter break.\n\n2. Where do they disagree?\nThere is no meaningful conflict:\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all independently point to a very low likelihood that weather alone would justify a snow day.\n- News intel doesn’t oppose this; it simply adds that school is already off for non-weather reasons. No source suggests conditions bad enough to force an emergency closure on a scheduled school day.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions (the advisory event with snow and flash freeze) peaked by Friday and are long over by Sunday.\n- Safety analysis timing: worst conditions for the weekend period are listed as ending around midday Sunday (2025-12-21T12:00:00) with minimal impact on the Monday commute.\n- By the critical window before a normal start (around 7:40 AM Monday), crews have had well over 24 hours of dry, cold weather and multiple full work cycles to treat and re-treat roads, lots, and walkways.\n- Effective ‘hours from snow end to 7:40 AM’ is more than a day, easily exceeding the margin usually needed in Michigan even for higher snow totals.\n\n4. Ice considerations\n- Temperatures will be below freezing, so some refreezing is possible, particularly:\n  - Residual meltwater at curbs and near piles\n  - Bridges, overpasses, shaded curves, and school entrances\n- However, meteorology shows no new precip (no freezing rain, drizzle, or fresh snow), and visibility is good. The safety analyst flags ice risk as only ‘moderate’, manageable via salting and spot checks, not as a systemic glazing event.\n- Critically, there is no sign of a significant, region-wide ice storm that would trigger the 60–85%+ snow-day category.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel finds no wave of neighboring districts declaring weather-based closures for Monday; instead, most are at or entering winter break.\n- Social media and local reporting show no buzz about a hazardous Monday morning or about ‘hoping for a snow day’ tied to this specific date.\n- Under the competition rules, the strong neighboring-closure bump (+15–20%) does not apply, as there is no such closure cluster for weather. Community sentiment is effectively ‘this is routine winter cold’, which supports the low-end probability range.\n\n6. What would make this wrong?\nThe forecast-based 5% probability would be wrong if:\n- A surprise overnight event occurred (e.g., an unmodeled band of lake-effect or a light freezing drizzle event) that significantly glazed roads just before the commute; or\n- A localized infrastructure issue (major water main break icing a key route, or widespread power outages) forced an emergency operational closure.\nGiven the current guidance and lack of such signals in news intel, these scenarios are low-probability but non-zero, justifying a small (not zero) snow-day chance.\n\n7. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly supports ‘routine cold, no storm’. This pushes the base probability near the bottom of the Michigan thresholds (<4\" and no new precip → ~5–10%).\n- Safety (25%): ‘Low’ risk, good road scores, and minimal commute impact justify staying at that low end and not inflating probabilities for marginal ice.\n- History (20%): Analog snow-day rates of 1–5% anchor the estimate; this argues against pushing above ~10%.\n- News Intelligence (20%): The key finding—Monday is already winter break—confirms that there is no practical snow-day decision to be made. Since there are no neighboring weather closures and no community alarm, this supports staying at the very low end. The usual upward adjustment for neighboring closures is not triggered.\n\n8. Final calibration vs. Michigan thresholds\n- There is effectively 0\" forecast new snow and no ice storm, placing this case at or even below the ‘<4\" snow = 5–15%’ band.\n- Historical and safety perspectives further suggest we should be at the bottom of that band, not the top.\n- The competition guidance recommends avoiding 40–60% unless experts conflict; here they strongly align on ‘school-as-usual’ conditions.\n\nAccordingly, I set the snow day probability (meaning: probability that weather alone would have forced a snow day if school were scheduled) at 5%, with high confidence. Operationally, Rockford is closed for winter break independently of weather.",
