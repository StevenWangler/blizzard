  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: Clear, dry, breezy day with 0% snow/ice and no alerts; strongly favors school in session.\n- Historian: Very similar past patterns almost never produce snow days (2–5% rate); strongly favors school in session.\n- Safety Analyst: Road conditions mostly very good (primary 9/10, secondary 9/10, lots 8/10), only moderate refreeze risk, minimal commute impact; recommends normal schedule.\n- News/Community Intel: No Rockford or neighboring closures announced, no meaningful wave of cancellations, and only general awareness of colder weather; sentiment labeled “uncertain,” not strongly pro‑closure.\n\nThere is essentially NO direct conflict in the core assessments: all four point toward normal operations with only minor caution for slick spots. The only subtle tension is that statewide media headlines mention more impactful winter weather in northern Michigan, which could be misleading if generalized to Rockford—but the local meteorological and safety analyses explicitly contradict that for Kent County (dry, no new snow).\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Forecast: No overnight or morning snowfall for Rockford on 2026-01-14.\n- That means plow/salt work is limited to treating any residual moisture from the previous rainy day and spot refreeze on bridges, lots, and side streets.\n- With no fresh accumulation to remove, the effective “plow timing” from last significant precip to the start of the school commute is many hours, and operations crews have ample time to address any trouble spots before 6–7 AM.\n- Hours from snow end to 7:40 AM: Not applicable; there is no new snow event.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Temps fall below freezing overnight with 15 freezing hours and some standing water from the prior day, so there is a **moderate localized refreeze risk**.\n- However, there is **no active freezing rain, drizzle, or mixed precip**, and no indication of widespread glaze.\n- Safety expert road scores (8–9/10) and the historian’s note that this pattern almost never triggers closure both indicate any ice is expected to be **patchy and manageable** with standard salting, not a system-wide travel hazard.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel explicitly finds **no confirmed closures or delays** for usual comparison districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n- Rockford itself has **no pre-announced closure/delay**; communications just remind families to watch for alerts in general.\n- Community sentiment is tagged as “uncertain,” not strongly pushing for or expecting a snow day.\n- Per the weighting rules, absence of a closure wave means **no positive adjustment** to the probability. The special +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring districts closing does not apply.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis and expert weighting\nBase from meteorology (35% weight):\n- No snow, no ice, no visibility issues, no alerts, typical Michigan cold.\n- Implied closure probability from the meteorologist’s narrative: on the order of 0–5%.\n- Assign meteorological component ≈ 3%.\n\nHistory (20% weight):\n- Historical analog snow-day rate 2–5% with high confidence; seasonal adjustment small.\n- Assign historical component ≈ 3%.\n\nSafety (25% weight):\n- Risk labeled low; explicit recommendation: normal schedule, no delay.\n- Low but not absolutely zero risk because of refreeze → assign ≈ 5%.\n\nNews/Intel (20% weight):\n- No closures nearby, no strong community push; sentiment uncertain, not \"this is nothing\" but also not “huge storm coming.”\n- In this framework, that supports staying close to the low historical/meteorological baseline—no upward bump from neighboring closures, no strong downward push either.\n- Assign ≈ 3–4%; use 3% for consistency.\n\nWeighted blend (approximate):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 × 3 ≈ 1.05\n- Safety: 0.25 × 5 ≈ 1.25\n- History: 0.20 × 3 ≈ 0.60\n- News/Intel: 0.20 × 3 ≈ 0.60\nTotal ≈ 3.5%. Rounding and recognizing the tiny but nonzero refreeze uncertainty, a **final prediction of 3%** is reasonable and keeps us outside the 40–60% “mushy middle” per the competition guidance.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe most realistic ways a closure could still occur despite this low probability:\n- **Unexpected early-morning black ice event**: If road temperatures drop faster than forecast or untreated wet areas freeze more extensively, leading to multiple crashes or widespread reports of icy back roads between ~5–6:30 AM, the district could pivot to a delay or closure.\n- **Unforecast snow band or squall**: A surprise lake-effect band or brief but intense snow squall setting up over northern Kent County during the bus window could temporarily reduce visibility and cover roads.\n- **Operational or infrastructure problem**: A large localized power outage affecting multiple schools or transportation operations, even without bad roads.\n\nAll of these depend on significant forecast busts or new non-weather issues. Given the current data, their combined likelihood is small and justifies a very low—but nonzero—snow day probability.\n\nConclusion: With dry conditions, manageable cold, historically low closure rates in this pattern, good road scores, and no neighboring closures, the best calibrated forecast is that Rockford Public Schools operate on a normal schedule on 2026-01-14, with an estimated **3%** chance of a weather-related closure or delay.",
