  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorology: Cold, dry high‑pressure day, no new snow, no ice signal, light winds, good visibility; explicitly calls snow day probability \"effectively 0%.\"\n- History: Nearly identical past patterns (cold, dry Mondays after light weekend snow) produce 1–3% closure rates; Rockford almost always holds school in these conditions.\n- Safety: Road scores 8.5–9/10, minimal commute impacts, overall risk \"low\" and explicitly recommends normal, on‑time start with standard winter precautions.\n- News/Intel: No NWS alerts, no Rockford or neighboring‑district closure announcements, and no media or social media buzz suggesting an expected closure.\nAll four experts align on: normal school operations and very low closure likelihood.\n\n2. Conflicts or disagreements:\n- There are no material conflicts. Meteorology, safety, history, and news all converge on a low‑risk, routine winter day. The only slight nuance is the safety analyst marking ice formation risk as \"moderate,\" but that is framed as isolated refreeze spots, not widespread hazardous glazing. This is fully consistent with the meteorological and historical analysis and does not create real disagreement.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM):\n- The storm that produced the existing snowpack ended well before the overnight leading into Monday. From the provided descriptions, roads have at least Sunday afternoon, evening, and the full overnight to be cleared and treated—on the order of 12–18+ hours before buses roll around 7:40 AM Monday.\n- With no additional snow and typical Michigan road operations, that window is more than sufficient to clear primary and secondary routes plus school lots to safe, passable condition.\n\n4. Ice assessment:\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain or mixed precip is forecast; it is simply cold and dry under high pressure.\n- Safety: Flags \"moderate\" ice formation risk specifically as localized refreeze in shaded or untreated spots, not a systemic ice event. Driving and walking scores remain high (9/10 driving, 7/10 walking), which would not be the case in a true ice storm.\n- History: Notes closures are usually driven by heavy new snow or widespread ice/mixed precip during the commute—conditions that are absent here.\nConclusion: There is no significant ice event; only routine patchy refreeze risk typical of a cold Michigan morning.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signal:\n- News/Intel explicitly states no pre‑announced closures or delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, or Rockford itself for Monday.\n- There are no Monday‑specific cancellation waves, no outage issues, and no NWS warnings aiming at Kent County.\n- Social media sentiment is labeled \"uncertain\" but, importantly, shows no strong expectation of a closure and no \"big storm incoming\" narrative.\nAccording to the weighting rules, the absence of neighboring closures means we apply no upward adjustment. Community is not acting like a closure is coming; if anything, the signal supports the low baseline probabilities from meteorology, safety, and history.\n\n6. Weighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Clear, dry, cold pattern with 0\" new snow and no ice drives the baseline closure probability down near 0–2%.\n- Safety (25%): High road and driving scores, minimal commute impact, no emergency access concerns sustain that very low probability, perhaps nudging it slightly above zero due to localized refreeze and cold exposure concerns (roughly into the 1–3% range).\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show 1–3% closure rates for this pattern, tightly reinforcing the 1–3% band.\n- News/Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no alerts, and no expectation of a storm maintain the probability at the low end; there is no reason for a positive adjustment from community or neighboring‑district behavior.\nSynthesizing all four, the most coherent calibrated value is about 2%: not literally impossible, but well within the \"rare exception\" range.\n\n7. Michigan threshold framing:\n- New snow: 0\" (far below any closure threshold; Michigan typically shrugs off <4\" with active precip, and here there is none).\n- No blizzard, no ice storm, and no extreme cold (wind chills are near 0°F, not in the –15°F to –20°F closure range).\n- Infrastructure and crews are fully capable of handling the leftover snow with the long plow window.\nGiven these thresholds, a closure would be a significant outlier behaviorally for Rockford.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- An unexpected overnight event: an unmodeled band of snow or freezing drizzle creating 0.25–0.50\" of ice or several inches of surprise accumulation directly during the 3–7 AM window.\n- A sudden, late‑breaking NWS advisory or warning plus a wave of neighboring districts announcing closures or delays very late Sunday night or early Monday morning.\n- Unanticipated non‑weather factors (major infrastructure failure, heating issues, or widespread power outages).\nNone of these are currently indicated by any expert or the news intel.\n\nDecision: With all four expert domains in clear agreement, plow timing generous, no real ice event, and no neighboring‑district closure signals, the calibrated snow day probability for Rockford, MI on Monday, 2025-12-08 is 2%, with high confidence. A normal, on‑time school day is overwhelmingly likely.",
