  "decision_rationale": "Most experts (meteorology/history/safety/news) converged on a ‘non-event’ day with near-zero snow and modest winds—normally a 5–10% closure setup in West Michigan, with a slightly higher chance of a delay if fog/patchy black ice is observed.\n\nHowever, the Web Weather Verification includes a critical alert: a Weather.com hourly view (international/mirror) shows feels-like approximately -25°F to -26°F during ~5–8 AM. Per the Extreme Cold Rules provided, ANY credible source showing ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours forces a 90–95% closure prediction. This rule overrides the otherwise-low snow/road-impact forecast and also overrides the debate’s ~7% consensus (which appears to have treated the Weather.com value as a mismatch rather than binding).\n\nGiven the asymmetric risk (children waiting at bus stops + bus start reliability) and the explicit policy constraint, the final probability is set at 92% with only moderate confidence (moderate because the wind-chill sources conflict strongly; high in the sense that, if that Weather.com value is what parents see, districts often close to match safety expectations). Recommendation: plan for closure unless a trusted local/NWS check before ~5:30–6:00 AM clearly shows wind chill above -20°F across the district and the superintendent is comfortable reversing.",
