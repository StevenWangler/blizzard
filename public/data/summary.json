  "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON\n- Meteorology: Storm’s main impacts are Sat–Sun, with heavy snow ending by late Sunday morning; Monday is cold, mostly dry, and relatively calm.\n- History: In this region, when a warning-level storm ends a full day before school, Monday is usually a normal school day.\n- Safety: Expect generally good-to-fair road conditions by Monday AM; primary and many secondary roads rated 7–8/10 with normal bus operations and only standard winter cautions.\n- News/Intel: No signals of planned closures or concern; district and neighbors behaving as if Monday is a routine return from break.\n\nAll four point toward school being open Monday.\n\n2. WHERE THEY DISAGREE\n- Meteorology vs. Safety: Meteorology frames Monday as largely benign; Safety labels overall risk as “moderate” due to residual packed snow/ice and frozen surfaces. This is more about caution level than closure justification.\n- History vs. Safety: Historical analogs put full snow-day odds at 5–15% in similar setups; Safety flags some lingering slick spots and plow berm issues but still expects normal operations. No expert explicitly argues for closure.\n- News/Intel vs. Others: News intel is effectively neutral to slightly pro-open: it documents a superintendent pattern of reopening quickly and shows zero early chatter about closing, but doesn’t guarantee anything.\n\nThere is no direct pro-closure voice; the only tension is between “low risk / open” and “low-to-moderate risk / open with care.”\n\n3. PLOW-TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW END TO 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions end: ~Sunday 11/30 at 10:00 AM (per both meteorology and safety timing).\n- First Monday buses / high-school start window: ~Monday 12/1 at ~7:40 AM.\n- Cleanup window: from ~10:00 AM Sunday to 7:40 AM Monday ≈ 21–22 hours of plowing and treatment available.\n\nKent County historically does well with this amount of time, especially with no ongoing heavy snow, no high winds, and no new precip during the commute.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Precip type: strictly snow for the storm; no mixed precip or freezing rain indicated.\n- Monday conditions: temps in teens–20s°F with **refreeze of residual moisture**, but that’s standard packed snow/black ice risk—not a glaze ice event.\n- Safety tool: lists ice-formation risk as “moderate,” referring to refreeze on untreated spots, not a dedicated ice storm.\n\nConclusion: No ice storm. Only typical post-storm slickness that Michigan districts routinely manage without closing when visibility and plow coverage are good.\n\n5. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS DOING?\n- Local News Intelligence explicitly notes:\n  - No weather-related alerts or banners for Rockford Public Schools.\n  - No neighboring district closures listed (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, etc.).\n  - No TV or online chatter suggesting widespread Monday closures.\n- Historical superintendent behavior (Bridge Michigan article): Rockford tends to reopen quickly after roads improve, even after a significant storm.\n\nEffect per rules: Since **no** neighbors are reported closing and community sentiment is basically “no buzz,” we **do not** apply any +15–20% bump. If anything, absence of chatter slightly reinforces staying in the low range.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nKey ways this 9% estimate could be off:\n- Underperforming plow cleanup: If Sunday snow totals run higher than expected or road commissions fall behind on rural/back roads, administrators might decide either:\n  - A 2-hour delay to give more cleanup time, or\n  - A full closure if they judge back roads and hills too risky for buses.\n- Surprise additional snow: If instead of 0.25\" after school, a new, poorly forecast band drops several inches before dawn Monday, that would sharply increase risk.\n- Localized ice issues: If melting under Sunday sun followed by strong overnight refreeze yields widespread black ice on hills, bridges, or gravel routes, they might lean more cautious.\n- Power/infrastructure issues: Extended outages or blocked access in parts of the district (not indicated now) could force closure regardless of weather.\n\nGiven the forecast and intel as provided, all of these are low-probability deviations.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS (WITH EXPLICIT MATH)\nPer instructions: Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News/Intel 20%.\n\n1) Meteorological assessment (35%)\n- Storm timing and intensity: Heavy snow is mostly done by late Sunday; only trace amounts Monday, after school.\n- Monday commute: Dry skies, light winds, acceptable visibility, temps in upper teens with modest windchill.\n- No active hazard during 4–8 AM.\nMeteorology-implied closure odds: ~5–10%. I assign **8%** to capture small risk of residual impacts.\nWeighted contribution: 0.35 × 0.08 = **2.8 percentage points**.\n\n2) Safety assessment (25%)\n- Primary roads score 8/10, secondaries and parking lots 7/10.\n- Risk level labeled “moderate,” but wording supports normal operations with winter precautions.\n- Key line: “Plan for normal school operations rather than a snow day.”\nSafety-implied closure odds: **10–15%** (room for a surprise issue, but baseline open). I use **12%**.\nWeighted contribution: 0.25 × 0.12 = **3.0 percentage points**.\n\n3) Historical pattern analysis (20%)\n- Pattern 1 (calm Monday after weekend storm): ~5% closure rate, high confidence.\n- Pattern 2 (6–12\" fresh snow, quiet Monday): ~10% rate, medium confidence.\n- Pattern 3 (warning previous day, roads improving): ~15% rate, medium confidence.\nThese cluster in the 5–15% band, skewed low when plows get a full day.\nGiven the matchup with Pattern 1 is strongest, I take a **9%** historical closure probability.\nWeighted contribution: 0.20 × 0.09 = **1.8 percentage points**.\n\n4) Local News & Community Intelligence (20%)\n- No early closure announcements or hints.\n- No social-media buzz about bad roads or ‘no way we’ll have school.’\n- Article evidence that Rockford tends to reopen once main roads are passable.\n- 0 neighboring districts currently flagged as closing; sentiment is effectively neutral-to-open.\nIn Michigan, truly likely snow days almost always show some Sunday-evening / early-Monday chatter or at least media speculation. The complete quiet strongly favors being open.\nNews/Intel-implied closure odds: **5–10%**. I use **8%**.\nWeighted contribution: 0.20 × 0.08 = **1.6 percentage points**.\n\nCOMBINED WEIGHTED ESTIMATE\n- Meteorology: 2.8\n- Safety: 3.0\n- History: 1.8\n- News/Intel: 1.6\nTotal = 2.8 + 3.0 + 1.8 + 1.6 = **9.2%**, rounded to **9%**.\n\nMICHIGAN THRESHOLDS CHECK\n- Snow amount: 7–10\"+ from the weekend, but **<0.5\"** Monday and none during commute.\n- Timing: Storm ends ~24 hours before school → far outside the ‘active storm’ closure pattern.\n- Ice: No ice storm; just standard frozen surfaces.\n- Wind: Max ~8 mph, no blizzard.\n- Neighbors: 0 known closures → no +15–20% bump.\nUsing your provided thresholds, this slots squarely in the **5–15%** band, in line with a routine Michigan winter day after a well-timed weekend storm.\n\nTherefore I set the final probability of a full snow day for Rockford, MI on Monday, 2025-12-01 at **9%** with **high** confidence.",
