  "decision_rationale": "1. What all four experts agree on:\n- Meteorology: The heavy, warning-level snow is a weekend event, tapering by late Sunday morning. Monday morning is cold (upper teens/low 20s°F), mostly dry, with only trace/light snow well outside the commute window.\n- History: This setup closely matches ‘day-after-the-storm’ Mondays where schools in West Michigan usually open. Historical snow-day rates for these analogs are 10–20%.\n- Safety: Road condition scores are fairly good (primary 8/10, secondary 7/10, lots 7/10). Commute impacts are rated “minimal” morning and afternoon, with only moderate ice risk and no emergency access concerns.\n- News/Community: RPS lists a normal Monday return, no weather alerts or pre-emptive closure hints; neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no posted Monday closures; no power issues or Monday event cancellations.\n\nAll four streams converge on: mainstream winter conditions, not an active Monday storm, and no strong institutional or social pressure toward closing.\n\n2. Where they disagree or add nuance:\n- Meteorology vs. Safety: Meteorology stresses no new precip and improving conditions; Safety still flags *moderate* ice risk and residual slick spots, especially on neighborhood/rural routes. This is a nuance in *how comfortable* the roads are, but not a contradiction about them being passable.\n- Meteorology vs. History: Meteorology labels the snow-day risk as “low”; Historical analogs quantify that as roughly 10–20%. That tight range is consistent, not true disagreement.\n- Community intel: Sentiment is described as “uncertain,” not clearly bullish or dismissive. There’s no dominant “this is nothing” narrative, but also no “everyone thinks we’re off Monday.” That keeps the News Intelligence neutral rather than a strong up/down adjustment.\n\nOverall, there’s no major conflict—just differing emphasis on residual slickness vs. routine winter operation.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM Monday):\n- Winter Storm Warning ends: ~10 AM Sunday (worst conditions largely before that).\n- School start reference: 7:40 AM Monday.\n- Time from warning end to school start: roughly 21.5 hours.\n- Within that 21.5 hours, the *worst* travel and visibility already faded by late Sunday morning, meaning plows likely have most of Sunday daylight plus overnight to fully clean primary routes and work deeply into secondary roads and lots.\n\nFor Kent County, having essentially a full day plus night after a storm is usually more than enough to get roads to ‘open-school’ standards unless a second wave or ice hits, which is not forecast here.\n\n4. Ice assessment (ice changes everything):\n- Temperatures stay below freezing from Sunday through Monday, which *reduces* melt–refreeze cycling during the specific Monday commute window.\n- Safety tool marks ice risk as “moderate,” reflecting:\n  - Residual hard-pack and slick spots where heavy weekend snow compacted.\n  - Potential icy patches on untreated sidewalks, lots, and rural/gravel roads.\n- Crucially, there is **no** indication of:\n  - Freezing rain or mixed precip.\n  - Rapid warming above freezing followed by sharp overnight refreeze.\n\nSo we have *patchy residual ice*, not a systemic ice storm or glaze event. That’s significant in Michigan but usually handled with extra caution, not full closure, given the otherwise favorable visibility and low wind.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and regional behavior:\n- Explicit check: Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD — no posted Monday, Dec. 1 closures as of Sat evening.\n- Regional news: Coverage frames this as a weekend-focused storm with warnings through Sunday morning, not a multi-day school-closing event.\n- No evidence of a closure domino effect starting early (which in this region often shows up the evening before if Monday looks truly bad).\n\nPer your own guidance, 3+ neighboring closures would add ~15–20 percentage points. Here we have **zero** visible Monday closures, so there is no upward adjustment from that rule.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong:\nMain failure modes that could push an actual closure higher than 17%:\n- Forecast bust: Heavier-than-expected snow persists or redevelops late Sunday night into early Monday, giving several more inches *during* the 4–8 AM window, with reduced visibility.\n- Unanticipated icing: A subtle warm layer, drizzle, or compaction/melt Sunday afternoon followed by aggressive refreeze overnight, leaving widespread black ice on hills, rural routes, and parking lots.\n- Operational lag: Kent County or local plow crews underperform (equipment issues, staffing, or extreme drifting in a few corridors), leaving too many bus routes marginal by ~5 AM Monday when superintendents decide.\n- Hidden infrastructure problems: Localized power outages, or an issue at specific buildings (e.g., lots not cleared, boiler or water problems) that don’t yet appear in regional intel.\n\nGiven current data, these are plausible but not likely, which is why the probability sits in the high-teens rather than near zero.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS (per your directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates storm timing is unfavorable for a snow day—heavy snow is Sunday, not Monday, with only ~0.25\" new snow and no commute-time precip. On its own, that suggests roughly a 10–20% chance.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates conditions as a ‘routine but slick’ winter commute: primary roads 8/10, secondary 7/10, parking lots 7/10, moderate ice. That leans toward *open with caution*, perhaps ~15–25% for closure given just the residual issues.\n- History (20% weight): Analog patterns have 10%, 15%, and 20% closure rates, and the seasonal adjustment is -0.2, making closures *less* likely than generic models might think for this setup. This pushes the prediction toward the lower end of the range.\n- News/Intelligence (20% weight, your “secret weapon”):\n  - No neighboring district closures posted → 0% of the +15–20% ‘domino’ bump.\n  - Official RPS communications are totally normal about Monday.\n  - Community sentiment is “uncertain,” not “we’re definitely out.” No clear expectation of closure, and also no strong “this is nothing” dismissal.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Meteorology-baseline: ~15–20%.\n- Safety slightly nudges toward the higher side of that due to residual ice potential, say +2–3 points.\n- History tugs back down a bit, reinforcing ~10–20% as the true historical range.\n- News intel is neutral to slightly *against* closure: no domino, no early closures, no clear expectation. That holds us near the lower-mid part of the historical range.\n\nFinal calibrated estimate: 17% snow-day probability.\n\nThis avoids the 40–60% ‘mushy middle’ because the expert consensus is actually quite aligned: conditions fit classic “school is open with some slick spots” more than any borderline close/delay scenario.\n",
