  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- Meteorology: No accumulating snow, no winter headlines aimed at Sunday night/Monday, temps around 30–33°F and slowly rising, light drizzle/fog the main issue. Concludes very low likelihood of a snow day.\n- History: Similar patterns (near-freezing, fog/drizzle, zero snow) produce snow days only ~2–5% of the time in Rockford. District typically closes only for 8–10\"+ snow, persistent ice into commute, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold. Assesses very low probability of closure for this setup.\n- Safety: Road risk low; primary roads 9/10, secondary and lots 8/10, driving conditions 8/10. Morning commute impact minimal, no plow-capacity issues, only scattered slick spots possible.\n- News/Intelligence: Rockford is on Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 2; there is no school day to cancel on Dec 29. No neighboring-district weather closures or buzz for that date.\nAll four agree there is no credible basis for a weather-driven closure of a school day on Monday, Dec 29—and the news intel further clarifies that school is not scheduled at all.\n\n2. Conflicts:\nThere are no material conflicts.\n- Meteorology mentions only a past advisory on Fri 12/26; it explicitly ends the same day and does not extend into Monday.\n- History and safety both support a low-risk Monday given above-freezing temps and no snow.\n- News intel’s note about a \"chance of further wintry weather Sunday–Monday\" is consistent with the very light, mostly-rain/fog signal in the meteorological dataset and does not contradict it.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Ice advisory: Friday 12/26, roughly 05:00–16:00.\n- After that, temperatures rise and remain near or above freezing, with light precip and fog through the weekend.\n- By Sunday 12/28 and into the pre-dawn of Monday 12/29, modeled snowfall is 0\" and roads are expected to be wet, not snow-covered.\n- For a typical 7:40 AM Monday start, there are well over 24–36 hours between the end of any meaningful icing and the Monday commute, giving crews ample time to treat/clear surfaces.\n- No overnight snow means no last-minute plow surge needed.\nResult: Plow timing is more than sufficient; it does not support a closure.\n\n4. Ice considerations:\n- Significant ice is limited to Friday under a Winter Weather Advisory, not Sunday night/Monday. That event is transient and ends the same day per NWS.\n- Some residual patchy slick spots can linger on untreated surfaces, especially with fog and near-freezing temps, but air temps rising into the mid 30s and light rain/drizzle help melt and dilute surface ice.\n- There is no signal of a new freezing-rain event on Sunday night into Monday in the provided dataset.\nThus, there is not the kind of widespread, ongoing ice on Monday morning that historically forces Rockford closures.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel explicitly notes that nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have no separate weather closures for Monday, Dec 29, because they are also on winter break or not in regular session.\n- No regional \"domino effect\" of closures is in play, and thus there is no +15–20% upward adjustment from neighboring-district decisions.\n\n6. What would make this wrong?\n- An unmodeled, stronger storm system developing late Sunday that produces unexpected heavy snow (6–8\"+), significant new ice, or blizzard-like visibility issues aimed squarely at Monday morning.\n- A misinterpretation of the school calendar (e.g., if the district actually had classes on Dec 29 despite multiple official posts to the contrary). Given two independent district sources confirming break through Jan 2, this risk is extremely low.\n- A significant, long-duration power-outage or tree-damage event persisting from the Friday ice into Monday, which current intel does not show (no major outage reports in Rockford).\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (as directed)\n- Meteorology (35%): Very clear: no snow, marginal temps, modest winds, fog main concern, advisory confined to Friday. On its own this supports roughly a 3–5% snow-day probability.\n- Safety (25%): Road and travel risk low; commute impact minimal; Michigan’s winter operations easily handle this. This nudges the probability slightly lower than raw meteorology might suggest, toward ~2–3%.\n- History (20%): Analog days under similar patterns show 2–5% closure rates, aligning strongly with the other two and reinforcing a low value.\n- News Intelligence (20% – secret weapon): Confirms school is not even in session on Dec 29 and that no neighbors are closing for weather. In a world where classes existed that day, lack of chatter would keep us at the low end of probabilities; in reality, it effectively turns any \"snow day\" question into moot. From a probabilistic scoring standpoint, the chance of a weather-based snow day call on a non-school day rounds essentially to 0–2%.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY CHOICE\n- Base from meteorology/history/safety: ~3–4% chance of conditions severe enough that Rockford might close if it were a normal school day.\n- News intel adjustment: Since the calendar shows no school on Dec 29, the effective probability of an actual weather-driven snow day decision is essentially zero. To reflect that while acknowledging a tiny tail risk of either (a) a stronger-than-expected storm or (b) a calendar error, I set the final probability at 2%.\n- This keeps us out of the discouraged 40–60% band and matches the strong consensus and high confidence level.\n\nTherefore: For Monday, December 29, 2025 in Rockford, MI, the probability of a *weather-caused* snow day is effectively near zero, and there is in any case no scheduled school to cancel. Normal operations (for those not on break) should proceed with standard winter precautions.",
