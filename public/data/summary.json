  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts align that Monday is cold but dry with 0\" new snow and no freezing rain signal; closure risk is mainly from localized black ice and possible patchy ice fog, not snowfall.\n2) Disagreement: The only meaningful conflict was web wind-chill data (some weather.com snapshots suggesting much colder). Web verification follow-up supports using WeatherAPI + NWS: NWS point forecast for Monday states wind chills as low as ~-7°F, and no reliable source confirms ≤ -20°F for the Mon 1/26 bus window.\n3) Plow timing math: With no snow event to end (0\" forecast), there’s no “snow-end-to-7:40 AM” recovery window needed. Infrastructure expects state highways clear and county/local roads passable by ~6:30 AM, though not necessarily bare pavement on neighborhood streets.\n4) Ice: No freezing rain indicated. Ice risk is residual/refreeze/packed-snow persistence in extreme cold (moderate but localized), plus possible ice-fog deposition.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel follow-up found no Mon 1/26 closure/delay posts for Rockford or nearby districts in accessible sources; earlier-week closures exist but are not Mon-specific, so no +15–20% neighbor adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Consumers Energy shows low systemwide outages (tens of customers affected) with no confirmed Rockford facility impact; this is not a strong closure driver right now.\n7) Wind chill cross-check: NWS + WeatherAPI both stay well above the -20°F threshold; therefore no cold-based near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) Dense ice fog persists into 6–8 AM broadly (not just valleys) causing widespread low visibility on bus routes, (b) an unforecast freezing drizzle/light snow creates a thin glaze overnight, or (c) a localized power outage hits one or more key school buildings early Monday.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% + Safety 20% + History 15% + News 15% + Infrastructure 10% + Power 10% + Web verifier 5%. Most components point strongly to “open” with a small tail risk for a DELAY; that keeps full snow-day probability low. Given Michigan’s higher tolerance and lack of active precip, I set 10% (slightly above the debate average 9%) to account for the fog/black-ice tail risk and uncertainty in live road-condition verification.",
