  "decision_rationale": "All expert inputs largely agree this is a quiet winter day meteorologically: no accumulating snow, light-to-moderate winds, and wind chills around +10°F during bus hours—nowhere near the ≤ -20°F automatic-closure threshold. The main weather nuisance is shallow morning mist/fog around 8–9 AM with visibility near ~1 mile, plus a plausible but localized black-ice risk on bridges/overpasses and shaded backroads if residual moisture exists. In Michigan (and specifically West Michigan), that combination almost never produces a district-wide weather closure; it’s typically handled via spot-salting and cautious driving. The only meaningful ‘conflict’ is the safety assessment labeling ice formation risk as “moderate” despite zero precip; reconciled as: ice risk is not district-wide, but localized/spotty where untreated moisture lingers. \n\nSeparately, local news intelligence indicates Rockford Public Schools are already scheduled CLOSED for Mid-Winter Break on Fri Feb 13, 2026—so the practical outcome is “no school,” but that is calendar-driven, not a weather ‘snow day.’ My probability above is for a weather-driven snow day/closure decision (if the district were otherwise operating).",
