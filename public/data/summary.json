    "No snow/ice forecast (0 inches; no active winter alerts) and light winds—meteorology strongly favors normal operations",
    "Wind chills around +6 to +16°F during 6–8 AM (well above the ≤ -20°F automatic-closure threshold)",
    "Main risk is localized black ice from possible fog/freezing-fog deposition and/or residual moisture refreezing on bridges/shaded back roads—more delay-risk than closure-risk",
    "No confirmed weather-driven neighboring-district closure wave; only a nearby Sparta scheduled delayed opening for teacher in-service (not a domino signal)",
    "Power grid: outages appear modest but have increased in the latest snapshot; still no evidence they’re concentrated in Rockford—watch for any localized school-facility outage overnight"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All four core experts (meteorology/history/safety/news) converged on a very low closure probability (~3–5%) because Monday’s forecast is dry with light winds and non-extreme cold. The only meaningful hazard signal is *not* snowfall—it’s the combination of high humidity/possible low stratus or fog indications plus subfreezing temperatures that could create isolated black ice on bridges, shaded rural segments, and slick school lots/sidewalks. Historically and operationally in West Michigan, that setup most often results in normal operations (sometimes with cautions or spot treatment) and occasionally a *delay* if early route checks confirm widespread glaze; it rarely produces a full district-wide closure.\n\nConflicts resolved: (1) Safety’s ‘moderate’ ice-formation risk is now anchored to a plausible mechanism (freezing fog/frost deposition and residual moisture), and the safety analyst indicated it should downgrade to low–moderate if pavement is confirmed dry Sunday night. (2) Web verification does **not** show any ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours; while web sources were somewhat stale/mixed, *none* indicate extreme cold. Therefore no automatic cold-closure rule is triggered.\n\nSecond-order/community effects: News intel found no credible wave of weather-driven neighboring closures/delays for Mon 2/9; the only confirmed neighboring operational change is Sparta’s scheduled delayed opening for teacher in-service, which should not pressure Rockford to close. Infrastructure operations (MDOT/KCRC typical playbook) support pre-dawn patrol/spot-treating on bridges and known slick locations, which usually keeps primary routes serviceable.\n\nPower: the newest outage snapshot increased (still not a major event). With quiet weather (no precip, light wind) the main risk is a *localized lingering outage* affecting a building’s ability to heat by morning, not storm-driven new outages. That is a low-probability but real ‘wildcard,’ which is why the probability is not ~3% and is set at 6%.",
