    "Meteorology strongly favors an on-time open day: no accumulating snow/precip expected during the Wed morning school-impact window; modest winds; wind chills ~14–16°F (well above -15°F to -20°F closure range).",
    "Main credible hazard is patchy refreeze/black ice from a sharp temperature drop into the teens plus a small Tue-night freezing-drizzle/freezing-rain signal; this more commonly drives DELAYS than full closures in Michigan.",
    "Infrastructure/road ops posture is ‘normal’ (patrol + spot-salt), not a plow-capacity event; treated main roads should be mostly passable by first-bus time, with isolated slick spots on bridges, shaded curves, and low-traffic neighborhood/rural segments.",
    "Power grid is not a driver: statewide outages are very low and stable; no weather factors (heavy ice/wind) suggesting escalating outage risk overnight.",
    "News intel shows a potentially high-impact conflict: FOX 17 reported Rockford listed as closed, but we could not confirm that listing’s date/recency via additional independent live closings sources; a WOOD-branded Yahoo story mentioning Rockford closures exists but is for a different date (Jan 22, 2026), so it does not validate a Feb 11 closure."

  "decision_rationale": "There’s a clear conflict between (1) the weather/roads/power fundamentals and (2) the single-source media claim of a closure list that includes Rockford.\n\nOn fundamentals, this does not meet Michigan’s usual closure triggers: no active snow, no meaningful accumulation, no high wind/drifting, and wind chills are in the teens—not in the -15°F to -20°F (or ≤-20°F automatic) bands. Infrastructure expectations also align with an OPEN day: it’s a refreeze/black-ice management night, not a situation where plows can’t keep up. The safety analyst’s own breakdown indicates the hazard is likely *patchy* (bridges, shaded curves, neighborhoods), which typically supports an on-time opening or at most a short delay—unless freezing drizzle verifies as more than trace and is widespread enough to keep even treated main roads slick.\n\nHowever, the news signal cannot be ignored because closings are ultimately administrative decisions. The issue is verification: we have FOX 17 saying Rockford is closed, but the environment couldn’t confirm a second independent, date-correct closings feed, and the district website capture didn’t show a closure notice. Because the corroboration is incomplete and web verification for date-specific pages was inconclusive, I’m not moving to a high (70–90%+) ‘already decided’ probability.\n\nNet: I’m forecasting a low-to-moderate chance of a closure (22%)—mostly to account for the possibility that (a) Tuesday night icing is worse than the WeatherAPI trace suggests *and/or* (b) the FOX 17 closure listing is in fact current and Rockford has already made the call. Absent confirmation of the closure listing, the best Brier-optimized play for Michigan is to stay decisively on the ‘open’ side while acknowledging a non-trivial upset risk from icing/administrative domino effects.",
