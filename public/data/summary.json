  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist, historian, and safety analyst all agree this is a routine mid‑January West Michigan setup: light to moderate lake‑effect snow showers, total new accumulation around 1\" Sunday, temps in the teens/20s, winds 10–15 mph, and no major storm or blizzard.\n- All three agree there is no significant ice storm or heavy overnight dump (4–8\"+) ending right at the Monday commute.\n- All three independently conclude conditions are manageable for a normal school day given local plow capability and Michigan’s high tolerance for snow.\n- News intelligence confirms there is no unusual weather pressure in the community or neighboring districts for that date.\n- News intelligence also confirms the key operational fact: Rockford Public Schools is already closed Monday, Jan 19, 2026, for MLK Jr. Day and staff PD; this is not a weather decision.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\n- There is no major conflict across experts. The only nuance:\n  • Meteorologist notes a brief mention of light freezing drizzle around 4 AM SUNDAY (the 18th), not Sunday night into Monday, and emphasizes that widespread icing into Monday is not strongly signaled.\n  • Safety analyst flags a \"high\" ice formation risk in general because pavement remains below freezing, meaning refreeze and black ice are possible in spots.\nThese two are compatible: the atmosphere is cold and any residual moisture will freeze, but there is no large‑scale freezing rain event.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (SNOW END → 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions are confined to Sunday (Jan 18) per safety timing: 00:00–23:59 Sunday is the main period for snow showers and some blowing/drifting.\n- By late Sunday evening, this is essentially nuisance‑level, on‑and‑off lake‑effect, with hourly rates only a few tenths of an inch at most.\n- That gives plows:\n  • All of Saturday to fully clean up the earlier advisory event.\n  • All of Sunday and Sunday night to manage the additional ~1\" of snow.\n- Even if light snow showers linger into early Monday morning, they’re very light, and Kent County crews are accustomed to operating during such events. Primary routes should be in fair–good shape by 6–7 AM with some slick spots on secondary roads and lots.\n- Net: Plow timing is favorable; there is no tight \"storm ends at 5–6 AM\" squeeze.\n\n4. ICE CHECK\n- Meteorology: Mentions one brief indication of light freezing drizzle around 4 AM Sunday, then temperatures stay well below freezing; notes that \"widespread icing is not strongly signaled heading into Monday morning.\"\n- Safety: \"Ice formation risk: high\" due to refreeze on existing snow/packed surfaces and possible black ice in less‑traveled areas and parking lots.\n- Synthesis: This is routine cold‑road refreeze risk, not an organized ice storm. In Michigan practice, this leads to slower travel, more salting, and caution, but typically not a closure driver by itself when precipitation is light.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel explicitly reports no neighboring district closures for Monday related to weather and no unusual buzz, outages, or event cancellations.\n- Per the weighting rules, no +15–20% uptick for regional closures is warranted.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- A narrow, intense lake‑effect band sets up directly over Rockford from roughly 3–7 AM Monday, producing a surprise 3–5\" burst with rapid accumulation, whiteouts, and untreated side roads.\n- Unexpected, more widespread freezing drizzle or freezing rain into Monday morning, generating glaze ice on all surfaces and overwhelming salting.\n- Sudden operational issues: equipment failures, an overnight plow staffing shortage, or a localized major accident that blocks key routes.\n- However, none of these are strongly indicated in the current data, and community/news signals do not suggest heightened concern.\n\n7. QUANTITATIVE PROBABILITY & WEIGHTING\nBase from historical patterns (20% weight):\n- Analog snow‑day rates: 3–10% range for similar setups. I take ~8% as a representative historical baseline.\n\nMeteorology (35% weight):\n- Very light new accumulation (~1\"). Well under Michigan thresholds (<4\" → 5–15% baseline). Conditions fit the lower part of that range, ~7–10% by snow alone.\n- No extreme cold or blizzard conditions.\n- I weight this toward ~10%.\n\nSafety (25% weight):\n- Road scores 5–6/10 (fair to moderate). Safety narrative explicitly supports “conditions manageable for a normal start” with caution.\n- This points to a modest operational risk, ~10–15% that conditions could be bad enough locally to justify a delay/closure.\n\nNews Intelligence (20% weight, the \"secret weapon\"):\n- Confirms Monday is already a scheduled non‑school day for MLK Jr. Day and staff PD. This dramatically reduces any *need* for a snow‑based decision.\n- No neighboring weather closures, no social media buzz, no reports indicating unusual hazard.\n- In practical terms, the probability that a *weather* snow day decision would be needed for this date is effectively near zero. However, to keep this exercise in the context of “if school were scheduled,” I apply news intel primarily to confirm there is no upward pressure; it nudges the probability slightly down within the already‑low range.\n\nWeighted synthesis:\n- Meteorology (35%): ~10%\n- Safety (25%): ~12%\n- History (20%): ~8%\n- News/Community (20%): ~5–8% equivalent, no added regional pressure\nCombined, this supports a low‑teens probability. I set the final snow‑day probability at 12% to stay consistent with Michigan thresholds (<4\" snow → 5–15%) and the clear consensus that operations are manageable.\n\n8. FINAL INTERPRETATION\n- For a *hypothetical* normal school day on Monday, Jan 19, 2026, the chance of a true weather‑driven snow day would be low, around 10–15%.\n- In reality, there is no snow‑day decision to make: Rockford Public Schools is already closed for MLK Jr. Day and staff PD. Weather impacts are minor enough that they do not transform this into an emergency closure scenario.\n- Confidence is high because: (a) all four expert domains align, (b) snowfall is clearly light, (c) plow timing is favorable, and (d) official district communications are explicit about the non‑weather closure.",
