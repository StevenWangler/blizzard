  "decision_rationale": "Based on the combined meteorological, historical, and safety analyses, Rockford, MI is experiencing a classic advisory-level early-season lake-effect and mixed-precipitation event. Air temperatures hover around 29–31°F from the overnight hours through the school day, with wind chills in the upper teens due to sustained WNW winds around 20 mph and gusts up to 40–45 mph. This temperature regime is cold enough for snow and freezing drizzle to adhere to untreated surfaces, while being marginal enough that treated primary roads can often be kept passable.\n\nThe forecast and NWS alerts show:\n- A Winter Weather Advisory for Kent County through the day, calling for up to ~2 inches of additional snow and gusty winds, with specific emphasis on slick bridges/overpasses and rapidly changing visibility in lake-effect bands.\n- A Wind Advisory (earlier overnight for the broader region, with high wind warnings along the lakeshore) indicating gusts up to 45–60 mph in nearby counties, now easing but still strong enough inland to cause blowing snow and occasional visibility drops.\n- Nearby Winter Storm Warnings to the west, north, and south (Mason, Newaygo, Allegan, Barry, Kalamazoo, Calhoun, etc.), where heavier lake-effect snow and whiteout conditions are expected. Rockford sits on the fringe of this higher-impact zone, so a modest shift in band placement could temporarily bring more intense snow into northern Kent County.\n\nHourly forecast data for November 27 shows:\n- Overnight through mid-morning (00:00–11:00): frequent light freezing rain and snow, with very high probabilities of both rain and snow in many hours, visibility sometimes modeled as low as 0–2 km (~0–1 mile) in bands, and gusts in the upper 20s to low 30s mph. This aligns with the advisory language about rapidly changing conditions and slick roads.\n- Midday to afternoon (12:00–17:00): still cold (around 30–31°F) with intermittent light freezing rain/snow and continued breezy WNW winds. Visibility improves overall but can still drop locally in bands. Road surfaces may remain patchy-icy, especially in shaded or less-traveled areas.\n- Evening and overnight into November 28: precipitation diminishes, winds gradually ease, and conditions trend toward cold, cloudy, and mainly dry with better visibility and more stable road conditions.\n\nFrom a safety and operations standpoint, the most critical factor for a snow-day decision is the morning commute window. The safety analysis flags the morning commute impact as severe, with high risk of black ice and patchy freezing drizzle on bridges, ramps, and secondary roads. Primary roads are likely to be treated and generally passable but may still have slick spots, especially where bursts of snow or freezing drizzle coincide with strong gusts and reduced visibility. Walking conditions for students and bus stop waiting conditions are also degraded by wind chills in the teens and potential for hidden ice on sidewalks and parking lots.\n\nHistorically, Rockford-area districts do not typically cancel for 1–2 inches of snow alone, especially when road crews are active and main routes remain open. However, the combination of:\n- An active Winter Weather Advisory during the commute,\n- Mixed snow/freezing rain with high ice-formation risk,\n- Strong winds and lake-effect banding that can cause sudden whiteout-like conditions,\n- And the proximity to Winter Storm Warning zones with heavier snow,\nraises the likelihood of at least some disruption (delays, selective cancellations, or a full snow day) above a routine light-snow event.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability of a full district-wide snow day is best assessed as moderate (around 45%). This reflects a meaningful chance that decision-makers opt for closure due to safety concerns on rural and secondary routes, but also acknowledges that conditions may remain just manageable enough—especially if bands stay mostly north or west—for an on-time or delayed start. Confidence is moderate because lake-effect band placement and intensity are inherently uncertain, and small shifts can significantly change local impacts within Kent County.",
