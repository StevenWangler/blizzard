  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, news intel, and web verification, the base case is a normal Michigan winter operating day: cold, overcast, and dry with no accumulating snow, no freezing rain signal, and good visibility. Historical analogs of cold/dry/light-wind days produce closures only a few percent of the time. The only meaningful uncertainty is second-order: isolated black ice from residual moisture (bridge decks, shaded dips, rural connectors) plus a small operational tail risk from scattered Kent County power outages. News intel did not find any Feb 9 closure/delay announcements for Rockford or nearby districts, and there’s no closure cascade developing. Web verification flagged large discrepancies in cached Weather.com temperatures, but importantly found no credible ≤ -20°F wind chill during 6–8 AM; therefore the extreme-cold automatic closure rules do not apply. Given Michigan’s high threshold for calling off school and the lack of a storm/ice driver, a full closure remains unlikely; the main practical outcome is ‘open’ with early-morning monitoring for slick spot reports and building power/heat status.",
