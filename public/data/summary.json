  "decision_rationale": "Pre‑decision checklist synthesis:\n1. Expert agreement:\n- All four lines of analysis agree Rockford is on the inland, lower‑impact side of a stronger lake‑effect system centered along the lakeshore (Muskegon/Oceana/Ottawa).\n- New overnight snow for Rockford is on the order of ~3\" (advisory‑level), with the steadiest snow 8 PM–4/5 AM and snow largely ending before the main 6–8 AM commute.\n- Winds are light (<10 mph), visibility improves by morning (mostly mist/low clouds rather than heavy snow), and temperatures are in the mid‑20s°F—cold but not extreme.\n- Roads at daybreak will be snow‑covered and slick in spots but, given West Michigan’s plowing capacity, primary routes should be in decent shape by 6–7 AM.\n- All narratives say this setup leans toward school operating as normal, with perhaps a need for caution or, at most, a short delay—not a classic snow‑day pattern.\n\n2. Points of disagreement:\n- Magnitude of total accumulation: Meteorology text suggests ~3\" for Rockford; history section references 4–6\" regionally, but both still characterize this as advisory‑level, not major‑storm for Rockford.\n- Ice risk: Meteorology says no mixed precip/ice signal; safety flags a “moderate” ice‑formation risk mainly from refreeze on compacted snow. These are compatible: no freezing rain or glaze, but expect typical cold‑road slick spots.\n- Community expectation: Social/media sentiment is described as uncertain, not clearly expecting widespread closures. No analysis claims a strong closure expectation in Rockford.\nNone of these are sharp conflicts; they affect nuance rather than the basic open/close call.\n\n3. Plow timing math (to 7:40 AM start):\n- Worst conditions: ~8 PM Mon – 4/5 AM Tue with moderate snow.\n- Snow ends: around 4–5 AM.\n- First buses/secondary runs: roughly 6–7:30 AM; high school start near 7:40 AM.\n- That gives about 2–3.5 hours between end of steady snow and the core bus window. With Michigan’s overnight plowing norms, this is usually enough for multiple passes on primary roads and at least one on key secondary/bus routes. Parking lots can be salted/sanded in that same window.\n- Safety explicitly notes: “plows should have multiple passes before the 6–8 AM commute” and that conditions lean toward normal start or at most a short delay.\nThis timing strongly favors school being able to open.\n\n4. Ice consideration:\n- Meteorological data: all snow, temps solidly in the 20s, no warm‑layer signal, no freezing rain.\n- Safety: “moderate” ice formation risk from refreeze/compaction on roads and parking lots, not from falling ice.\n- Visibility: mist/fog near daybreak, but not freezing drizzle.\nSo there is no systemic ice storm or glaze scenario—just the usual cold‑snow slickness. Under the given thresholds, absence of true ice keeps us in a lower‑closure regime.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals:\n- News intel finds: no announced Tuesday, Dec. 2 closures for Rockford or close neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, core Kent ISD). Closures discussed in media were primarily for Monday after the weekend storm, and mainly in harder‑hit or more rural districts.\n- No ISD‑style closure lists showing Rockford closed for Tuesday as of the analysis time.\n- No power outages or major event cancellations locally for Tuesday.\n- Media framing: inland districts like Rockford are expected to see ‘nuisance to moderate’ snow and improving roads after heavy lakeshore bands, not crippling new totals.\nUnder the provided rules, since there are not 3+ neighboring Tuesday closures and no strong community expectation of closure, there is no upward adjustment from the news‑intel side.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A mesoscale surprise where a strong lake‑effect band stalls over inland Kent County into or through the 5–8 AM window, pushing totals toward the high end (6\"+) right as buses roll and leaving roads less plowed than expected.\n- Slower‑than‑normal plow performance (equipment issues, staffing, or underestimation) leaving key secondary/rural bus routes snowy and rutted by 6–7 AM.\n- Unforeseen localized freezing drizzle or black‑ice development on major arteries, leading to a spike in crashes and prompting a late closure or delay.\n- Administrative caution exceeding historical norms (e.g., a superintendent particularly sensitive after earlier incidents), choosing closure despite manageable conditions.\n\nWeighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates advisory‑level 3\" new snow, snow ending before commute, light wind, no ice. This points to a low closure likelihood (<25%).\n- Safety (25%): Rates risk as moderate, with roads difficult but manageable, recommending normal start or at most a short delay. This also supports a low closure probability.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs yield 10–25% snow‑day rates for very similar setups in early December. This reinforces a low but non‑zero probability.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No Tuesday closure announcements, no neighboring‑district domino, and messaging focused on improving conditions. Under your rules, we do NOT apply the +15–20% or +10–15% upward adjustments because the signals for widespread closure are absent.\n\nNumerical calibration vs. Michigan thresholds:\n- Expected accumulation for Rockford: ~3\" overnight, maybe slightly more counting earlier Monday, so effectively at the high end of the “<4\" snow” bracket, which your guidance maps to roughly 5–15% snow‑day probability under normal Michigan tolerance.\n- Timing (snow ending before commute) and lack of blizzard/ice push *against* closure.\n- However, this follows on the heels of roughly 10\" over the weekend, so roads and lots are already stressed; this justifies nudging slightly above the base 5–15% band.\n- Historical analogs (10–25%) and safety’s ‘moderate risk’ point to a value near the lower–middle of that range.\nBalancing these, I place Rockford’s closure probability at 18%: clearly on the ‘schools likely open’ side, but leaving room for an outlier administrative or road‑condition call.\n\nBecause the multiple data sources are broadly consistent and there is no contradictory signal from neighboring districts or community expectation, the confidence in this low‑probability estimate is high. Avoiding the 40–60% band is appropriate here because the evidence does not show genuine deep uncertainty or strongly conflicting expert opinions.",
