    "Multiple neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, GRPS) are also off for Mid-Winter Break, reducing any operational pressure to run buses/classes.",
    "Weather is not a snow/ice event: near-0 accumulation expected; primary hazard is fog/mist with localized slick-spot/bridge black ice risk, which would more typically prompt caution messaging (or at most a delay) if school were in session.",
    "No extreme-cold trigger: web sources do NOT show ≤ -20°F wind chills during 6–8 AM; winds are modest.",
    "Power outage signal is small/scattered (not widespread), unlikely to force a district-wide closure beyond the already-scheduled break."
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Interpreting the question as “Will Rockford Public Schools be closed on Monday 2/16/2026?”, the probability is effectively 100% because the district has an official, pre-scheduled Mid-Winter Break closure for that date (confirmed via the district homepage and an official news post). This is not weather-dependent.\n\nIf instead you mean a counterfactual “weather-driven closure if school were in session,” the expert consensus is that closure probability would be very low (≈1–3%): no meaningful snow/ice accumulation is forecast, no extreme wind chill is indicated by web verification, and the main operational hazard is fog/mist with possible localized black ice on bridges/overpasses—typically managed via spot-salting and route checks rather than a district-wide closure in Michigan. Power-outage risk appears low and scattered, not a closure driver.",
