  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: No snow, minimal new precip (0.02\"), temps ~30–37°F, fog and drizzle, Winter Weather Advisory ice event ends days earlier. Explicitly states setup is not supportive of a snow day.\n- Historian: Similar patterns (fog, light prior icing, above-freezing temps, no accumulating snow) yield 2–5% closure rates; Rockford/Kent County typically only closes for 8–10\"+ snow, active ice storms, or dangerous cold. Concludes Monday would almost always be a regular day.\n- Safety analyst: Road, walking, and driving scores all good (7–8/10); morning commute impact minimal; recommends normal schedule with routine winter precautions.\n- News intel: Confirms Rockford Public Schools are closed Dec 22–Jan 4 for Winter Break; Dec 29 is already a scheduled no-school day. Neighboring districts are also on break, not closed for weather.\nAll four agree there is no major active winter hazard at school time, and that Dec 29 is not even a scheduled school day. The only slight tension is regional media mentioning a possible storm somewhere on the Great Lakes vs. the very tame local forecast and high historical/safety confidence.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions window: about 9 PM–midnight Sunday (patchy drizzle, fog, very marginal near-freezing temps).\n- No accumulating snow to plow; road crews mainly manage wet surfaces and any residual slick patches.\n- By 3–4 AM, temps are at or above freezing and rising; by the 6–8 AM commute, conditions are mainly wet with isolated slick spots.\n- Effective plow/treatment window from end of minor hazards to first bus: ~6–8 hours, with no snow accumulation. Safety analyst calls commute impact minimal.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Prior Winter Weather Advisory for freezing rain is for Friday, Dec 26, and ends the same day. Crews have 48+ hours before Monday.\n- Sunday night: temps hover near freezing but trend upward, and precipitation is light drizzle/rain, not a new ice storm.\n- Safety analyst classifies ice-formation risk as moderate but with good overall road scores and minimal impact. No indication of widespread, ongoing glazing into the commute. So: some patchy slick spots possible, but no systemic ice event that would justify closure in Michigan.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Neighboring Kent ISD districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) are also off that week for Winter Break; no districts are treating Dec 29 as a normal class day requiring a weather closure decision.\n- No snow-emergency declarations, no widespread outage or emergency reports for Rockford/Kent County, and no social-media buzz about a specific Dec 29 snow day.\n- Because closures are calendar-based, not weather-driven, there is no +15–20% bump from neighboring districts: they are not closing FOR weather; they are simply on break.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates non-event conditions for a Michigan snow day (rain/fog, no snow, marginal temps). This strongly suppresses probability.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good scores on all travel metrics; explicitly says no weather-driven need for closure. Further suppresses probability.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 2–5%; seasonal adjustment actually reduces odds further given conditions. Aligns with meteorology and safety.\n- News intelligence (20%): Key insight that Dec 29 is already a non-school day. For prediction of a weather-based snow day, this effectively drives the probability very near zero.\n\n6. Rockford/Michigan thresholds\n- Snow: 0\" forecast vs. 4\"+ typically needed even to start moving odds. No criteria met for 4–6\", 6–8\", or 8\"+ bands. No blizzard, no active ice storm.\n- Ice: Friday’s light glaze is old news by Monday; no ongoing ice storm, no widespread new glazing during the commute.\n- Neighboring districts: Not closing for weather, so no threshold bump.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A last-minute, unforecast shift that brings a real ice storm or heavy, fast-accumulating snow into Kent County Sunday night, producing widespread untreated ice/snow by 5–7 AM Monday.\n- A sudden decision by Rockford to extend break or close facilities specifically citing weather (e.g., power outages, local emergency), despite the current lack of such signals.\nThese scenarios are low likelihood given the current forecast and historical behavior but not impossible, so I avoid a 0% prediction and set it at 3%.\n\nOverall conclusion: Weather and safety conditions are consistent with a normal school day, but there IS no school scheduled. The chance that Dec 29 is labeled a \"snow day\" due to weather is therefore extremely small—schools are already closed for Winter Break, and the weather pattern is not at Michigan snow-day thresholds.",
