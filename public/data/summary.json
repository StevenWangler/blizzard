  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorology: ~2\" total snow, all snow (no ice), onset around late morning to midday, heaviest during afternoon/evening, winds ~10–20 mph, temps below freezing but not dangerously cold.\n- History: This pattern (light–moderate daytime snow, near 30°F, modest winds, no blizzard/ice) is very typical mid-January weather in West Michigan and rarely causes closures.\n- Safety: Morning commute (6–8 AM) is dry/overcast with minimal impact; main deterioration occurs midday through afternoon with reduced visibility and accumulating snow. Risk is moderate but manageable, especially early.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district has pre-announced a closure or delay; local media are not treating this as a major storm targeting Kent County. Community sentiment reflects “typical winter snow” rather than a shutdown event.\nAll agree this is a routine, manageable winter event with biggest impacts AFTER the school day starts.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist’s implicit snow-day estimate: ~15–25% based purely on forecast magnitude and timing.\n- Historian: 5–10% based on analog events and district behavior.\n- Safety: Operational recommendation is clearly to hold normal school with possible early-dismissal planning; this functionally aligns closer to the 5–15% range.\n- News/Intel: Signals show strong expectation that schools will be open. That supports the low end of the range.\nThere is a minor disagreement between meteorology’s 15–25% and history’s 5–10%, but not a fundamental conflict: the met outlook is slightly more conservative; history and real-world behavior are more permissive.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Snow is forecast to START around midday Friday and continue into evening, tapering by late evening/early night (around 9–11 PM) per the timing and safety analyses.\n- The key school decision window is early Friday morning (5–6 AM) for a potential closure call. At that time, roads are expected to be dry and cold with NO new overnight snow.\n- Because the event is daytime/afternoon-focused, there is effectively infinite plow lead time before the START of snow; there is no need for overnight clearance before morning buses.\n- Any plowing required will occur during/after school and into the evening, well before the next school morning. Thus plow timing is highly favorable for having school on Friday.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorology: Precipitation type is snow; freezing rain or mixed precip not indicated.\n- Temps: Below freezing but near 20–30°F, good for salt effectiveness; no warm-layer aloft flagged.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk labeled “moderate,” but in context this refers to spot slick areas on bridges/untreated surfaces, not glaze ice or a significant icing event.\n- News/Intel: No reports of an ice storm or widespread icing.\nConclusion: No significant ice event. Only routine cold-surface slickness. This does NOT trigger the higher 60–85% closure band defined for ice/8\"+.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News/Intel confirms: as of late evening Jan 15, no advance weather-related closures or delays for Rockford or neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD member districts) for Jan 16.\n- No TV station closing lists show preemptive closures in Kent County for that date.\n- Community events are proceeding; no pattern of regional shutdown.\nSo: 0 neighboring districts closed in advance → no +15–20% bump. If anything, this supports staying at or below the historical low-end probability.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\nKey failure modes:\n- Forecast bust: A stronger-than-expected lake-effect band stalls over northern Kent County overnight or early morning, producing 4–6\"+ BEFORE buses run.\n- Surprise ice: A shallow warm nose or mist/drizzle leads to black ice widespread enough to challenge plows and salt.\n- Sudden advisory upgrade/overnight heavy squall line that drops visibility near zero during bus pickup.\n- Operational choice: Even with manageable conditions, the superintendent could opt for an abundance-of-caution closure or half-day, but historical behavior and signals do not point strongly that way.\nGiven current data, these are low-probability tails but they are the main paths to being wrong.\n\nWEIGHTING EACH EXPERT (explicit per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Points to a low-end event for Michigan: ~2\" snow, all falling after the morning commute, with no ice, no blizzard, and no advisory directly over Kent County for Friday. On its own, suggests perhaps ~20% snow-day risk because districts sometimes overreact to afternoon travel. Weighted contribution: 0.35 × 20 ≈ 7 points.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates road and travel risk as moderate overall, minimal impact for the morning and more issues afternoon/evening. Recommends normal in-person school with increased afternoon caution and possible early-dismissal planning. Interpreted as ~10–15% closure probability (favoring staying open). Take 12% as center: 0.25 × 12 ≈ 3 points.\n- History (20% weight): Analog events and typical district behavior give a 5–10% snow-day rate; center ~7%. Weighted: 0.20 × 7 ≈ 1.4 points.\n- News/Intel (20% weight, SECRET WEAPON): No advance closures, no pressure from media, and community tone is that this is standard winter weather. That supports near-historical low end, ~5–10%. Take 7%. Weighted: 0.20 × 7 ≈ 1.4 points.\nBase weighted blend ≈ 7 + 3 + 1.4 + 1.4 = 12.8%.\n\nMICHIGAN THRESHOLDS CHECK\n- Snow: Forecast total ~2\" (<4\"). Their guideline: <4\" → 5–15%.\n- Timing: Snow after the morning commute; biggest issues during afternoon. That would nudge slightly UP from the extreme low (5%) but still within 5–15%.\n- No ice, no blizzard, no 8\"+, no extreme wind chills.\n- Neighboring closures: none → no +15–20% bump.\nThis aligns with a final band of about 8–13%. The weighted expert blend gave ~13%. To stay decisive and within the state-specific thresholds, I round to a clear 10%.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- Snow day probability: 10%.\n- This sits firmly in the <4\" standard Michigan winter category and matches historical and community signals.\n- The most likely outcome is a NORMAL SCHOOL DAY on Friday, Jan 16, 2026, possibly with:\n  • Slower afternoon bus runs\n  • Cautionary communication to parents and staff\n  • Potential adjustments to late/after-school activities if snow intensifies after 3 PM.\nI avoid the 40–60% band because there is no genuine high-uncertainty conflict: all four expert domains are coherently pointing to a low-closure environment.\n",
