  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Clearly states a cold, dry, overcast day with 0.00\" precip and 0.0 cm snow, no snow or ice issues expected, and explicitly concludes this does not meet criteria for a snow day.\n- Historian: Shows similar past patterns almost never cause closures (2–5% historically) and notes that none of the usual closure triggers (heavy snow, ice, extreme cold) are present.\n- Safety analyst: Rates roads and travel as good (9/10 on primary/secondary roads, low overall risk) with only patchy refreeze risk and explicitly states conditions do not justify closing or delaying school.\n- News & community intel: No current closures or delays in Rockford or neighboring districts, no countywide advisories, and forecasts/media language framing this as routine winter driving, not a big storm. Community chatter expects ‘slow and slippery’ at most, not a snow day.\nAll four point in the same direction: very low closure likelihood. There are no substantive conflicts—only a slight mismatch between some media wording about ‘accumulating snow’ vs. the provided forecast data, which shows 0\" new snow. Given our direct meteorological dataset and the safety scores, I weight the technical forecast more heavily than generic TV phrasing.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total new snow forecast: 0\". \n- Snow end time: effectively N/A; the meteorological analysis indicates no active snow at all on Wednesday.\n- Plow demand: none for new accumulation; only normal salting/sanding for potential overnight refreeze on isolated spots.\n- From ‘last weather impact’ to first bell: any minor refreeze develops gradually overnight, giving road crews many hours before the 7:40 AM bus window to address bridges/overpasses. This strongly favors normal operations.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology: Prior light rain on Tuesday with temps falling below freezing overnight; no new precip. That implies only residual moisture refreezing.\n- Safety: Classifies ice-formation risk as moderate but localized, and still assigns high scores to road conditions (8–9/10) and minimal commute impact. No mixed precip or active freezing rain is forecast.\n- Net: There is *some* patchy black ice risk, especially on untreated surfaces and bridges, but not a systemic ice event. This is well within the range that districts in Kent County routinely manage without closing.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel explicitly checks Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD: none have announced closures or delays, and TV closing lists are empty for Jan. 14 as of the analysis time.\n- Road authorities (Kent County Road Commission/MDOT) report normal winter operations, no travel advisories or emergencies.\n- Social media sentiment is ‘uncertain but watching,’ with expectations of typical slick spots, not stay-home conditions.\nGiven the rule that 3+ neighboring districts closing would add 15–20% to the probability, here we have the opposite: zero closures and no strong community push for closing. That supports staying near the historical base rate (a few percent) rather than bumping it up.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Dominant signal. 0\" snow, 0% precip, non-extreme cold. Strongly argues against closure.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good road scores, minimal commute impact. Reinforces a low probability.\n- History (20%): Analog days produce closure rates around 2–5%. This anchors the numeric estimate.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no emergency messaging, community expectation of a normal school day. Slight downward pressure on any higher guess that might be suggested by generic TV ‘messy commute’ language.\nCombining these, a forecast probability around 7% is consistent: slightly above the bare-minimum 2–3% historical rate to account for modest refreeze and the ever-present possibility of a localized issue, but still within the 5–15% Michigan threshold range for <4\" with no storm.\n\n6. What would make this wrong?\nThe main ways this 7% estimate could be off are:\n- Unmodeled overnight event: An unexpected snow band sets up and drops several inches on Rockford specifically, contrary to the current 0\" forecast.\n- Surprise ice: More residual moisture than expected plus inefficient salting leads to widespread black ice and multiple early crashes, prompting a last-minute safety-based closure or delay.\n- Non-weather factors: Infrastructure failure (e.g., power outage at multiple buildings) or a bus fleet/mechanical issue unrelated to the forecast.\nThese scenarios are low probability but not zero, which is why the prediction is not 0% but in the single digits.\n\n7. Final calibration vs. Michigan thresholds\n- Expected snow: effectively <1\" (actually 0\"). Michigan threshold guidance says <4\" → 5–15%.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no advisory, no 3+ neighboring district closures.\n- Historical analogs and expert consensus all push toward the lower end of that band.\nThus I place the snow-day probability at 7% with high confidence that Rockford will hold a normal school day on Jan. 14, 2026.",
