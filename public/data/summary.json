    "No active weather alerts and no credible wind-chill hazard (web verification shows ‘feels like’ hot/humid, not cold)",

  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge on a non-winter, non-hazardous setup for Lagos: temperatures remain in the low–mid 80s°F with no freezing period, snowfall probability and accumulation are 0, and winds are modest. Web verification corroborates the API: ‘feels-like’ is hot/humid (upper 80s to near 100°F), so the Michigan extreme-cold closure rules are not applicable. The only plausible weather disruption is very localized lightning or a brief shower near arrival; that typically causes short outdoor holds rather than a full-day closure. Because the quantitative precip signal is extremely small and there are no alerts, the closure probability is kept near-zero with only a small base-rate hedge (≈0.5%) for an isolated storm cell directly over a campus/route or a non-weather operational disruption.",
