  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis (all 7 inputs, weighted per directive):\n1) Agreement: All experts converge that Wednesday is mostly a clean-up day with near-zero new snow. The main risk is secondary—patchy ice/hard-pack on local roads plus some visibility pockets. No expert supports extreme wind-chill shutdown thresholds.\n2) Disagreements: The only real tension was whether the midnight glaze/visibility issues would persist into the 6:30–8:30 AM bus window. Safety + infrastructure clarified it is primarily a post-event risk (patchy slick spots that can persist because temps stay near 0–10°F), not ongoing widespread precip/whiteout at bus time.\n3) Plow timing math: Impacts mainly Tue; ~17 hours until 6:30 AM Wed. Infrastructure expects trunklines/arterials passable by 6:30 AM, but neighborhood streets may still be hard-packed/snow-covered. That leans away from full closure and toward “open or delay.”\n4) Ice: Yes—there is a non-zero ice signal (brief freezing rain/drizzle around 00:00–02:00). However QPF is tiny and both safety + infrastructure expect patchy (not widespread) glazing, which typically drives delays more than full closures.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed weather-driven wave of K-12 closures for Wed in the Rockford cluster from accessible sources. One nearby closure (Cedar Springs) is confirmed but due to boil-water advisory, so it should not be treated as a weather domino.\n6) Power: Statewide outages remain extremely low/stable; no cluster evidence. No power-based override.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier found no sources suggesting ≤ -15°F to -20°F for Wed morning; likely around -6 to -10°F. So no cold-threshold bump.\n8) What would make this wrong: If the midnight freezing precip is more than a trace and/or freezing fog becomes widespread near daybreak, producing broad glazing on secondary roads across the district, Rockford could pivot to a 2-hour delay or (less likely) closure despite low snowfall.\n\nWeighting: Meteorology (25%) keeps baseline low due to 0\" snow; Safety (25%) bumps risk due to persistent hard-pack/patchy glaze on local roads; News (15%) provides strong “Tuesday was rough” context but lacks Wed closure confirmations; Infrastructure (10%) supports ‘passable mains, weak locals’ which is more delay than closure; History (15%) supports low closure frequency in this pattern; Power (5%) no boost; Web verifier (5%) confirms no extreme wind chill. Net result: a low-to-moderate closure probability, with delay more likely than a full snow day.",
