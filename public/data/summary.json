    "No accumulating snow/ice forecast for Mon 2/9 (0\" in the provided forecast); Michigan districts almost always remain open in this setup",

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, and infrastructure, the base case is a classic West Michigan “no-closer” day: no new snow/ice, light winds, and temps in the 20s rising toward near-freezing. Historically this pattern produces full closures only a few percent of the time. The only credible disruptor is visibility (possible dense fog/low stratus) with a secondary, localized risk of black ice from fog/mist deposition or refreeze on bridges/overpasses and shaded rural connectors. Even if that verifies, Rockford-area districts more commonly choose a short delay or operational mitigations (route checks, reduced speeds) rather than a full-day closure. \n\nConflicts were resolved as follows: Safety rated ice risk “moderate” despite 0 precip; on clarification, that was based on localized glaze/black-ice mechanisms (fog deposition + residual moisture/refreeze), which raises delay odds more than closure odds. News/outage context (Kent County elevated outages) is noted, but there’s no evidence yet of a concentrated outage impacting Rockford school facilities, and no Monday closure wave is posted. Web verification did NOT find any ≤ -20°F wind chill for Monday morning (so the extreme-cold automatic rule is not triggered). \n\nRecommendation: probability of a FULL snow day/closure is low, but a 2-hour delay is a plausible contingency if near-zero visibility or widespread slickness is observed on early route checks.",
