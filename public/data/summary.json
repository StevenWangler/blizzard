  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement across experts: All four inputs converge on a mostly-overnight, light event. Snow totals are around ~0.9\" and the main precip ends before the morning commute, which strongly lowers full-closure odds in Michigan. All also flag the real operational risk as localized slickness (ice/refreeze) rather than plowable depth.\n2) Disagreements/uncertainties: The only meaningful tension is the meteorology feed labeling “mixed/freezing rain” vs. the updated meteorologist clarification that the 03:00 freezing-rain signal has essentially zero QPF (trace at most) and may be a low-confidence mix artifact. That reduces the true “ice storm” risk, but does not eliminate refreeze slick spots.\n3) Plow timing math: Safety analyst computes precip effectively ending ~03:00–04:00, yielding ~4h40m (03:00→07:40) or ~3h40m (04:00→07:40) of treatment/plow window. That is a strong argument against a closure given the light accumulation.\n4) Any ice?: Not enough evidence for measurable accretion; best call is “trace possible,” with refreeze of leftover moisture as the bigger hazard. No indicators of widespread glazing.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel re-scan found NO confirmed Jan 22 closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts checked (Forest Hills, Northview, Sparta, Lowell, Kenowa Hills, Caledonia, Grand Rapids). This removes the +15–20% neighbor-closure bump.\n6) What would make this wrong?: (a) A surprise heavier band or lake-effect burst lining up 6–9 AM (visibility drops + quick accumulation), (b) freezing drizzle more persistent than modeled leading to widespread glaze on secondary roads, or (c) an unreported local outage/road-incident cluster prompting precautionary closure.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Light snow, ends early; ice risk downgraded to trace → closure signal low.\n- Safety (25%): Moderate morning commute impact mainly from slick spots; explicitly says closure low, delay low-to-moderate → supports no snow day.\n- History (20%): Similar patterns show ~12–18% snow-day rate; icing setup could push higher but confidence low → modest baseline only.\n- News intel (20%): No official closure signals for Thu; no neighbor closures confirmed → pushes probability downward.\n\nApplying Michigan thresholds: <4\" snow typically 5–15%. With no confirmed ice storm and no neighbor-closure bump, the correct range is near the low end. I’m setting 12% (leaning “no snow day,” with a non-trivial chance of a 2-hour delay if road checks find widespread polishing/glaze on secondary routes).",
