  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis (weighted):\n1) Agreements across experts: Everyone agrees there is essentially no meaningful snowfall Friday and winds are light; the primary hazard is patchy ice/black ice in very cold temperatures. Power outages are not currently widespread.\n2) Disagreements: The only material conflict is wind chill magnitude. WeatherAPI + meteorologist imply worst feels-like around ~-8°F (not a policy trigger). Weather.com shows ~-25 to -26°F (would be a near-automatic closure trigger). Web verifier could not pull an authoritative NWS point forecast to resolve it; a third non-official text source suggested ~-18°F. Because the <= -20°F condition is not confirmed by multiple reliable sources, I cannot treat it as “near-automatic,” but it does keep the probability from dropping into the single digits.\n3) Plow timing math: Based on infrastructure, trunklines should be in the best shape by 06:30. County arterials/bus connectors likely treated by ~05:30–07:30 but not uniformly “clear and dry.” Local/residential feeders are least likely to be fully treated by 06:30 and can stay patchy until after ~07:00–10:00 when daytime resources ramp up. This supports “delay more plausible than closure.”\n4) Ice check: Meteorologist clarifies that during the 04:30–07:30 decision window the provided hourly data are essentially dry; ice accretion is TRACE at most, with the only tiny freezing-precip signal around midnight. So risk is localized slick spots rather than a widespread glaze.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel did not confirm any Friday closures/delays in accessible official sources; thus no +15–20% neighbor-closure bump applies.\n6) Power: Kent County appears minimal outages; no confirmed school facility outages.\n7) Wind chill confirmation: Not confirmed by multiple sources; keep as a risk scenario, not the baseline.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) If NWS/official forecasts verify wind chill <= -20°F at bus time, closure probability would jump dramatically. (b) If freezing drizzle is more widespread than the hourly dataset indicates, a thin glaze on untreated roads could force a 2-hour delay or closure.\n\nWeighting: Meteorology (low precip/trace ice) and safety/infrastructure (patchy ice + treatment variability) dominate the baseline, keeping full-closure likelihood low. News context (recent multi-day impacts) supports a small upward adjustment but cannot override the weak Friday forcing. The unresolved wind-chill discrepancy is the main reason this isn’t <10%.\n\nBottom line: A full snow day is unlikely; a DELAY is the more realistic operational outcome if early-morning spot checks find widespread black ice or if extreme wind chills are confirmed.",
