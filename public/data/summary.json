    "No new accumulating snow forecast for Mon 1/26 (WeatherAPI shows 0\")—major closure trigger absent",
    "Primary operational risk is refreeze/black ice from prior wintry mix + very cold overnight temps (low ~2–6°F), mainly on residential/secondary roads and bridges",
    "Possible dense ice fog/low visibility during the bus window (model/feed shows very low vis at times), but corroboration is uncertain",
    "Neighboring districts: no confirmed closures/delays posted as of Sun night—reduces odds of a region-wide shutdown",
    "Wind chill discrepancy across sources: one Weather.com page shows ≤ -20°F (auto-trigger territory), but other web pages and WeatherAPI do not; NWS hourly couldn’t be verified here",
    "Power outages currently minimal (Consumers snapshot ~68 customers affected systemwide; no evidence of a local outage cluster)"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree Monday is mostly dry with no meaningful new snowfall; the main hazards are residual slick spots (refreeze/black ice) and potentially low visibility (ice fog). They also agree a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The only major conflict is wind chill—WeatherAPI bottoms near ~-7°F, but one Weather.com view suggests ≤-20°F. Web verifier re-check still shows inconsistent Weather.com variants and could not confirm NWS hourly in this environment, so this remains unresolved.\n3) Plow timing math: Precip ended Sun evening; there are ~12+ hours until ~6:30 AM. That is typically enough time for highways/arterials to become serviceable, but *also enough time for refreeze* to keep residential/secondary roads icy. Infrastructure monitor expects arterials mostly passable by 06:30–08:00 with localized black ice; residential streets most likely still icy.\n4) Ice?: Yes, moderate risk (refreeze/black ice) due to earlier light freezing rain/light snow and very cold temps. Not an active ice storm Monday.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no verified closures/delays for Rockford, Forest Hills, Northview, Sparta, Lowell, Kentwood, or GRPS for 1/26—no upward adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Minimal currently (~68 systemwide in Consumers snapshot); no sign of a local outage-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: Not confirmed by multiple reliable sources. One Weather.com page hits ≤-20°F, but other pages + WeatherAPI do not, and NWS couldn’t be checked here; therefore I cannot apply the near-automatic closure rule.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) If NWS hourly/observations confirm wind chill ≤-20°F near 6–8 AM, closure probability jumps into the 90% range; (b) if widespread dense ice fog (≤0.25 mi) or widespread glare ice on neighborhood/bus-route roads is observed at 5:30–6:30 AM, many districts could call a 2-hr delay or even close.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verifier (5%). Base closure odds on a cold/dry day with residual slickness are low (history 7–15%). Safety suggests full closure ~10% and delay ~35%. Infrastructure supports “arterials ok / residential still icy,” consistent with delay-not-closure. News shows no closure signals. Power is not a driver.\n\nGiven all that, I set full snow-day (closure) probability at 14% (low, but not zero). Most disruption risk is better represented as a *2-hour delay* scenario rather than full closure. Confidence is moderate because the wind-chill and visibility signals are not authoritatively resolved here.",
