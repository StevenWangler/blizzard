    "No new snow/ice precipitation expected Thu morning (forecast ~0\") → major downward pressure on closure odds",

    "Main risk is leftover/refreeze black ice from Wed impacts on bridges, shaded areas, and some residential/secondary roads",
    "Infrastructure signals suggest main routes likely passable by ~6:30 AM; any disruption more consistent with a 2-hour delay than a full closure",

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreements across experts: All agree Thu is cold but largely quiet with no meaningful new snow; closure, if any, would be driven by residual/black ice rather than active snowfall. Power-grid risk is negligible.\n2) Disagreements: News/infrastructure referenced “anticipated icy roads,” but meteorology indicates no Thu precip. Follow-ups clarify the ice concern is predominantly refreeze/leftover slick spots, not new freezing drizzle. Visibility “0-mile” entries are treated as likely data artifacts absent corroboration.\n3) Plow timing math: With no accumulating snow Thu, this is not a plow-capacity event. There are ~21 hours from Wed lingering impacts to Thu 6:30 AM; main routes are expected serviceable by bus time, but patchy slick spots can persist on low-priority streets/bridges.\n4) Ice present? Potential is moderate but expected to be patchy (bridges, shaded curves, parking lots, subdivisions), not widespread on primaries.\n5) Neighboring districts: Latest checks did not find confirmed Thu 1/29 closures/delays among nearby districts (GRPS/Kentwood/Northview/Sparta/Cedar Springs), and no strong community buzz surfaced.\n6) Power outages: Extremely low; no school-facility outage signal.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS digital/hourly table confirms ~+1°F wind chill at 6–8 AM Thu—nowhere near ≤ -20°F.\n8) What would make this wrong: If early Thu road checks reveal widespread glaze/hard-pack on secondary/residential bus routes (numerous slide-offs, consistent braking problems), Rockford could opt for a 2-hour delay or, less likely, a closure.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology strongly suppresses closure odds (dry, light wind). Safety/infrastructure keep non-zero risk due to refreeze and patchy black ice. News intel found no neighboring-district closure cascade. Power and web verification remove two major “automatic” drivers (outages, extreme wind chill). Net: low probability of a full snow day; higher probability of a delay than closure.",
