  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorologist: Rain/sleet system is gone by school time; Friday is cold, overcast, and DRY with 0.0\" snow and no active ice.\n  • Historian: This pattern (dry, mid‑20s°F, gusty but non-extreme winds, no new precip) has essentially a 0–5% historical snow-day rate in Rockford/West Michigan.\n  • Safety analyst: Primary and secondary roads 8–9/10, parking lots 8/10; only scattered black ice from refreeze, manageable via normal salting. Recommends school be open with routine caution.\n  • News intel (local signals): Rockford and neighboring districts show no posted closures or delays; coverage emphasizes a tricky flash-freeze commute but not shutdown-level disruption.\n\n- Apparent conflict:\n  • Broader NWS/statewide news highlight a flash-freeze advisory and 1–4\" regional snow with a potentially slick commute, and a Detroit outlet pegs closures around 40% for THEIR area.\n  • However, the Rockford-specific meteorological analysis given here shows 0\" new snow and a dry column by Friday morning. That suggests Rockford is on the lower-impact side of the same system, with the advisory applying more broadly and not guaranteeing local snow/ice issues severe enough for closure.\n\nGiven the explicit Rockford forecast (0\" snow, no active icing) and the high historical and safety confidence, I treat the Detroit 40% school-closure outlook as only a weak upward nudge, not a primary driver.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Precip has ended before midnight per the meteorologist: by 00:00–02:00 local, the system is through and the air mass is drying out.\n- Worst road-condition window in the safety analysis: 00:00–08:00, driven by flash-freeze/refreeze of Thursday’s moisture, not by ongoing precip.\n- Morning start of operations: In West Michigan, road crews typically work the pre‑dawn window; with no falling snow to keep up with, they focus on salting and spot-treating.\n- School bell time: Around 7:40 AM first bell; main bus runs in the 6:30–7:30 AM window.\n- Effective plow/salt window from end of precip to first bell: Roughly 5–7 hours of subfreezing, dry conditions (from ~00:30–01:30 to 7:40). That is ample time for crews to salt and for most standing water to freeze into treatable patches rather than active, accumulating slush.\n- Safety analyst explicitly expects primary routes to be in good shape by 6–8 AM, with only isolated slick spots left.\n\n3. Ice/flash-freeze risk\n- Meteorologist: 24 hours below freezing with a sharp drop after rain/sleet does create refreeze potential, but there is NO ongoing sleet/freezing rain Friday and NO accumulating snow.\n- Safety analyst: Labels ice risk as \"moderate\"—i.e., scattered black ice on untreated spots and familiar danger areas (bridges, shaded rural curves, subdivision side streets). Importantly, they still score roads and lots 7–9/10 and state conditions do NOT warrant closure.\n- News intel: NWS language about a \"flash-freeze\" is real but applied area-wide; the Rockford-specific forecast and lack of active advisory-level snow for the morning commute suggest the primary hazard is patchy, not widespread glaze.\n- Conclusion: There is some ice risk, but not a full-on ice storm or widespread glazing event. This falls well short of the \"ice changes everything\" scenario that would push probabilities into the 60–85% range.\n\n4. Neighboring districts & domino effect\n- News intel reports NO confirmed closures or delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD for Friday, Dec. 19, on either district sites or West Michigan TV closing lists.\n- Rockford itself lists 12/19 as a normal school day, no alerts.\n- Michigan thresholds in the prompt say: 3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20% adjustment. We are clearly NOT in that scenario now; the absence of a domino wave supports staying at the low end of closure odds.\n\n5. How each expert is weighted (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Core signal is 0\" new snow, dry conditions during school hours, and non-extreme cold/wind. This strongly favors staying open. I anchor the base probability near historical norms for such a day: around 5–10%.\n- Safety (25%): Road and walking conditions scores (7–9/10) plus explicit guidance that a closure is not warranted confirm that, from a transportation perspective, a normal day is appropriate. This supports the low end, nudging maybe +0–2% due to moderate black-ice risk but no more.\n- History (20%): Similar patterns in this region/time of year show essentially 0–5% snow-day rates. This firmly caps the base at a very low level under otherwise normal operations.\n- News intelligence (20%):\n  • Upward pull: NWS/advisory language and a Detroit-based ~40% closure outlook demonstrate that statewide conditions are borderline in some places; I add a small bump (roughly +3–5 percentage points) to reflect uncertainty around how severe icing actually gets overnight.\n  • Downward/neutral pull: No local closures yet, no Rockford alert, and local coverage focuses on caution rather than cancellations. No neighboring-district domino effect means I do NOT apply the +15–20% adjustment.\n\nCombining these: a historically typical, dry, cold post-storm day (≈5–8%) plus a modest uplift for flash-freeze uncertainty (+3–5%) yields a final probability around the lower edge of Michigan’s <4\" band. I set the prediction at 12%: higher than a trivial 5% to respect the ice risk, but clearly in the \"schools almost certainly open\" regime.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside error (underestimating closures):\n  • If the actual precip doesn’t clear as modeled and Rockford ends up under a late-developing band of accumulating snow (e.g., surprise 3–5\" by dawn) or widespread glaze ice from freezing drizzle, the risk would shift into the 35–60% range quickly.\n  • If overnight verification shows unexpectedly severe black ice on bus routes (multiple spinouts, police reports, or EMS calls), Rockford and neighbors could move toward closure or at least 2‑hour delays.\n- Downside error (overestimating risk):\n  • If roads dry quickly after the rain and refreeze is very minor (just a few slick spots), the real closure chance may be closer to the true historical baseline of ~5%, making my 12% a slight overestimate.\n\nGiven the ensemble of signals, the main risk to my forecast is the inherently hard-to-forecast spatial variance in icing; however, the absence of accumulating snow and the strong local tolerance point firmly away from a high closure probability.\n\nFinal call: Conditions favor a normal school day. The most realistic alternative is a small chance of a short delay if refreeze proves worse than expected, but a full snow day remains unlikely.",
