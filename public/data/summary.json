  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorologist: ~3\" of snow, moderate at times, ending near or shortly after the start of the commute, winds light, temps near 27–30°F, no major alerts. Assesses full closure chance at about 10–15%, favors full school day.\n- Historian: Similar past patterns (3–4\" overnight, ending near the commute, no blizzard/cold extremes) yield about a 10–20% historical snow day rate in West Michigan. Emphasizes that this is a classic, manageable early-January event.\n- Safety Analyst: Road and travel risk rated moderate. Worst conditions midnight–7 AM, with gradual improvement from 8–9 AM onward. Suggests on-time start with cautious driving; at most a short delay if snow overperforms (>5–6\").\n- News/Community Intel: No active winter storm warnings/advisories for Kent County for Monday morning, no neighboring district closures or chatter, RPS calendar and website clearly say school resumes Jan 5 with no weather caveats.\n\nAll four are aligned that:\n- This is a routine, plowable West Michigan snow event.\n- Impacts are mainly during the pre-dawn hours.\n- Conditions improve during the school day.\n- The baseline probability of a full snow day is low.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no meaningful conflicts:\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all converge on a low but non-zero closure probability (~10–20%).\n- News intel does not contradict them; it adds that there is no regional closure momentum.\nGiven this alignment, no tool-based conflict resolution is needed.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Snow window: roughly 11 PM Sun–7 AM Mon, with worst conditions roughly midnight–7 AM.\n- First buses / decision window: Rockford typically starts routes around ~6–6:30 AM; school start about 7:30–7:45 AM.\n- By about 7–8 AM, accumulating snow is ending and roads begin improving.\n- That leaves several overnight hours for plows to work during the event plus 1–2 hours of tapering/light snow or flurries before school starts and continued cleanup into late morning.\nGiven Kent County’s plow capacity and that total snow is only about 3\", this is well within normal clearing capability; primary routes are likely in decent but slushy shape by the main commute.\n\n4. ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: Precipitation type for the main event is snow; temperatures stay in the upper 20s to near 30°F. No explicit freezing rain signal.\n- News intel: A Special Weather Statement notes patchy freezing drizzle and light snow Sunday evening, mainly as a marginal slick-surface risk, not a full ice storm.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk called \"moderate\"—largely from cold pavement, light freezing fog/mist, and packed snow, not a dedicated ice storm.\nConclusion: There may be slick, icy spots (especially on untreated surfaces and during/after the light freezing drizzle), but there is no indication of a major glaze or widespread ice storm. This does NOT meet the \"ice changes everything\" threshold used for higher closure probabilities.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICT STATUS\n- News intel explicitly reports:\n  - No announcements from Rockford or neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) about closures or delays.\n  - No regional domino-effect signals, no winter storm warnings in effect for Monday morning.\nThus, the adjustment rules for neighboring district closures do not apply: there are 0 confirmed closures, so NO +15–20% bump.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nMain failure modes:\n- Underestimated snow totals: If a stronger band forms and Rockford ends up with 5–6\"+ by 5 AM, especially if rates >1\"/hr persist close to the commute, secondary roads and hills could be much worse than forecast, potentially justifying a 2-hour delay or, less likely, a closure.\n- Underestimated ice: If freezing drizzle becomes more widespread or transitions to light freezing rain overnight, creating a thin but widespread ice glaze, conditions could move into the 60–80% closure territory typical for ice events.\n- Surprise advisory/warning: If NWS upgrades Kent County to a Winter Weather Advisory or Warning centered on the Monday morning commute with higher totals or significant ice, school leadership could opt for delay/closure even with similar amounts.\n\n7. QUANTITATIVE WEIGHTING (per instructions)\nBase expert-derived closure range:\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): 10–15% → take midpoint 12.5% → contribution = 0.35 * 12.5 ≈ 4.4\n- Safety (25% weight): Describes a low-to-moderate risk, on-time start; implicitly maybe 10–20% for any schedule disruption, lower for full closure. Use 15% → contribution = 0.25 * 15 = 3.75\n- Historian (20% weight): 10–20% historical rate → midpoint 15% → contribution = 0.20 * 15 = 3.0\n- News Intel (20% weight): Strongly favors school opening (no chatter, no neighbors closed). Assign 5–10% for closure; use 8% → contribution = 0.20 * 8 = 1.6\nSum of contributions ≈ 4.4 + 3.75 + 3.0 + 1.6 = 12.75%.\n\nMichigan threshold calibration:\n- For <4\" snow, guidance is 5–15% closure probability.\n- Forecast snowfall (~3\") and lack of major ice or extreme cold put this in the lower half to middle of that band.\n- The expert-weighted 12.75% sits comfortably within 5–15% and near the middle.\nTo stay decisive and within the given Michigan framework, I round to 14% (inside 5–15%, slightly above the raw 12.75% to acknowledge moderate ice risk and the front-loaded timing).\n\n8. AVOIDING 40–60% RANGE\nThere is no genuine expert conflict and no major uncertainty band suggesting a coin-flip situation. All signals cluster around a low chance of closure. Using a mid-range 40–60% would misrepresent the consensus and worsen the Brier score.\n\nFinal judgment: This is a typical, manageable 3\" overnight snow for Rockford with some slick spots and a moderate but not extreme impact on the early commute. On balance, the probability of a full snow day is about 14%, with relatively high confidence that school will open on time.\n",
