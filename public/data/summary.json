    "Ice-first event with freezing drizzle/freezing rain in the 03:00–05:00 window, with temps staying well below freezing so any glaze persists into bus time",
    "Timing overlap with bus routes (06:30–07:30): infrastructure expects scattered slick secondary/local roads even if main corridors are treated",
    "Michigan context: negligible snow (~0.05\") and light winds strongly favor staying open or using a 2-hour delay rather than full closure",
    "No confirmed Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay announcements found in latest scan (weak “domino effect” pressure)",
    "Power outages currently appear scattered/low-level; not a decisive closure trigger, but a non-zero wildcard if any school facility loses power in extreme cold"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Experts agree this is not a snow-accumulation closure setup; it’s an ice/glaze timing problem. Meteorology shows tiny QPF and near-zero snow with light winds, but freezing drizzle around 03:00–05:00 can create black ice that won’t melt at teens/low-20s. Safety and infrastructure both flag high risk on secondary/local streets and parking lots right during bus time; however, main highways/arterials should be mostly wet/salty by 06:30. News intelligence shows no confirmed Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay announcements yet, reducing the likelihood of a proactive full cancellation. Power grid risk is currently scattered and stable, so it’s a secondary wildcard rather than a primary driver. Wind-chill conflict: despite a web-verifier ‘mirror’ page showing ≤-20°F, the cross-check concludes there is no credible, correctly localized support for ≤-20°F wind chill in Rockford during 06:00–08:00; with ~20°F air temps and light winds, -20°F wind chill is physically implausible—so this does not trigger the automatic extreme-cold closure rule. Net: a meaningful chance of full closure exists if morning road checks find widespread glaze on bus routes, but the most likely operational outcome in West Michigan is a 2-hour delay or opening with caution; therefore I set full-closure probability at 32% (delay probability would be higher).",
