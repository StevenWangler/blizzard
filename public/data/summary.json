    "Main accumulating snow signal is for Sunday 2/8 (≈3–4\"), not Monday 2/9; Monday looks more like post-storm cleanup/refreeze risk than an active-storm bus-window problem",
    "Plow timing math favors opening: snow tapers late Sunday morning, leaving ~19–20 hours before Monday bus routes for MDOT/Kent County to clear priority roads",
    "Main residual risk is localized slick/compacted snow + refreeze on secondary/neighborhood and rural connector roads during 5:30–8:30 AM Monday (bus-route limiting factor)",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district “domino” closures yet for Monday; Rockford and nearby districts show no pre-announcement signals",
    "No credible source indicates wind chill ≤ -20°F for Monday morning (so no extreme-cold automatic closure trigger); power-outage situation not confirmed and appears unlikely to be widespread given light winds, but remains a wildcard without live map access"

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, news, infrastructure, and power: the experts largely agree the impactful snow is a Sunday-morning event (~3–4 inches) with enough time before Monday’s commute for typical West Michigan plow/treatment operations to catch up on highways and primary bus-route roads. The key conflict was the safety timing window (Mon 5:30–8:30) versus the hourly snowfall window (Sun 3–10); follow-up confirmed Monday risk is primarily post-storm refreeze/compaction, not active snowfall—so a full closure is less likely than a normal open or a 2-hour delay.\n\nNews intelligence did not find confirmed Monday closures/delays among major nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Lowell, GRPS), and community buzz is limited/uncertain—this removes a major domino-effect driver. Web verification also found no ≤-20°F wind-chill trigger for Monday morning, keeping this out of the ‘automatic closure’ band. Power-grid information is low confidence due to interactive map limits, but with light winds and relatively cold (likely drier) snow, widespread outages are not the expected outcome.\n\nNet: the most likely decision for Rockford on Mon 2/9 is OPEN, with a meaningful but not dominant chance of a 2-hour delay if Sunday cleanup is imperfect and refreeze produces scattered “one-bad-intersection” hazards on neighborhood/rural bus segments. Full closure remains a tail risk tied to localized overperformance (totals >~6\") and/or widespread Sunday-night reports of roads still snow-covered + numerous slide-offs or an outage affecting school buildings.",
