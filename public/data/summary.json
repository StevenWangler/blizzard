  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all agree this is a significant winter storm: mixed precip changing to snow, falling temps into the 20s, gusts potentially 40–60 mph, whiteout risk, and hazardous travel during both the morning and afternoon windows.\n- They agree timing is bad for a typical school day: worst conditions roughly 3 AM–6 PM, overlapping the entire bus and teen-driver window.\n- All three technical domains flag elevated risks: high ice risk, very poor visibility, drifting, and at least several inches of snow.\n- News Intelligence agrees that there is no active pattern of neighboring districts issuing weather closures for Dec. 29.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\n- Meteorologist and safety analyst implicitly treat Dec. 29 as a normal school day, giving an 80–90% closure likelihood based purely on weather and safety conditions.\n- Historian echoes: with school in session, this pattern often produces many closures (historical snow-day rate ~50–60% for similar storms).\n- News Intelligence directly contradicts the premise that a weather decision is on the table: Rockford Public Schools’ official calendar marks Dec. 29 as NO SCHOOL – Winter Break, with school not resuming until Jan. 5. Neighboring districts show similar breaks and no weather alerts.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions: ~3:00 AM to ~6:00 PM.\n- School start (if in session) would be ~7:40 AM. By then, snow and blowing snow are ongoing; there is effectively zero-hour gap between meaningful improvement and the start bell.\n- Snow and wind continue through the afternoon, so there’s no clear window for plows to fully “catch up” before either commute.\n- If school WERE in session, this timing strongly favors a closure from a safety perspective.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorology: mixed precip (rain → sleet → snow) with temps dropping from upper 30s to the 20s; this setup strongly supports a thin underlying ice layer on roads, bridges, and parking lots.\n- Safety assessment explicitly rates ice formation risk as HIGH and notes very slick bridges/overpasses.\n- Ice plus strong winds and low visibility would normally push the closure probability into the upper Michigan range (≥60%) if classes were scheduled.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News Intelligence finds:\n  - Rockford: official calendar shows winter break on Dec. 29; no special weather closure communications.\n  - Forest Hills Public Schools (nearby): no weather-related closure alerts for that date; also appears to be on winter break around then.\n  - Broader Kent County: no evidence of weather-based closure alerts or a domino effect of cancellations for Dec. 29.\n- Therefore, the \"3+ neighboring districts closed\" storm signal is NOT present. The lack of closure chatter is explained by most districts simply being on break, not by benign weather.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\n- Two key failure modes:\n  (a) Administrative change: If Rockford unexpectedly had a special session, athletic practices, or mandatory in-person events on Dec. 29 that effectively function as school days, then the true ‘snow day’ decision context would exist, and weather-based closure probability would jump toward ~75–85%.\n  (b) Calendar misinterpretation: If the academic calendar or News Intelligence sources were outdated or incorrect and students were, in fact, scheduled for a normal school day on Dec. 29, then the low 5% probability would understate the real risk of a closure.\n- Based on the provided intel, both scenarios look unlikely: the calendar is explicit and marked as official, and no local news indicates school operations on that date.\n\n7. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (PER SPECIFIED PERCENTAGES)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Pure-weather closure likelihood (if school were in session) is very high (≈80–90%) due to timing, wind, and visibility. This pushes the raw weather-based closure tendency strongly upward.\n- Safety (25%): Rates risk as SEVERE, with clear recommendations to avoid student transport during peak hours and to assume a high likelihood of full closure under normal operations. This reinforces the meteorological case for closure if school existed.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs for similar storms show ~50–60% closure rates, plus a 0.15 seasonal adjustment upward because this is classic late-December storm timing. History confirms this is a “closure-type” storm pattern in West Michigan when school is on.\n- News Intelligence (20% – the tie-breaker): Shows decisively that there is:\n  - No scheduled school on Dec. 29 (officially winter break).\n  - No neighboring-district weather closure wave.\n  - No social media buzz or major news coverage framing this as an active school-closure event.\n\n8. SYNTHESIZED DECISION\n- If the question were, “Would Rockford likely close on Dec. 29, 2025, IF school were in session?” the integrated expert signal (strong storm, bad timing, ice, whiteouts, Michigan thresholds) would support roughly a 75–85% closure probability.\n- However, the actual question is: “What is the probability of a WEATHER-BASED SNOW DAY for Rockford on Dec. 29, 2025?” Given the official calendar, there is effectively no opportunity for a snow-day decision; school is already off for winter break.\n- Therefore, the operative probability that students experience a *weather-caused* snow day is very low and mainly tied to tail scenarios where special sessions or miscommunications exist.\n- Balancing all this, I set the snow-day probability at 5% with HIGH confidence. The low number is not because the storm is weak, but because the institutional decision (no school due to break) is already made for non-weather reasons.\n",
