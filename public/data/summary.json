  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and disagreement\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • Meteorologist, historian, safety analyst, and news intel all indicate that the main storm impact is on Sunday, not Monday.\n  • All agree that Monday morning (Dec 1) is cold but quiet: no active snow or ice during the commute, light winds, and typical Michigan winter slickness.\n  • All agree expected additional snow on Monday is minimal (~0.6\"), occurring after 9 PM, well after school hours.\n  • All concur that plow crews have ample time from Sunday midday through the night to clean up roads and that Monday looks like a normal post-storm school day.\n  • No expert signals active warnings during school hours Monday, extreme cold, or widespread hazardous travel conditions.\n\n- DISAGREEMENTS:\n  • There are no major conflicts. The only nuance is emphasis: \n    - Safety analyst calls risk level “moderate” due to patchy black ice and residual slick spots.\n    - Historian emphasizes that closures in this region usually require ongoing heavy snow, ice, or extreme cold—none of which applies Monday.\n  • News intel notes uncertainty in community sentiment (some hoping for closures), but not a strong expectation of a snow day or evidence of a closure domino.\n  Overall, expert opinions are consistent and all point to low closure probability.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- From the meteorology and safety tools:\n  • Worst of the storm: around 12:00 AM–10:00 AM Sunday (2025-11-30) with the Winter Storm Warning expiring at 10:00 AM.\n  • Lingering minor snow/cleanup: through early afternoon Sunday, effectively wrapped up by ~14:00–15:00.\n  • Dry window: from roughly Sunday 18:00 through at least Monday 08:00 there is no meaningful new snow or freezing rain.\n- That gives:\n  • End of meaningful accumulating snow: ~10:00–15:00 Sunday.\n  • First buses / high school start: ~7:40 AM Monday.\n  • Dry/plow window: approximately 16–18 hours (even taking the conservative 14:00 Sunday to 07:40 Monday gives ~17.5 hours).\n- Safety analyst explicitly expects:\n  • Primary roads in good shape by ~04:00–05:00 Monday.\n  • Secondary/neighborhood roads in usable condition by ~05:30–06:00.\n- Conclusion: Plow timing clearly favors normal operations. Crews have more than enough time to clear 7–8\" of weekend snow before school.\n\n3. Ice risk assessment\n- Temps: upper teens to low 20s°F overnight and during the morning commute, staying below freezing but well above extreme cold thresholds.\n- Precip: No freezing rain or drizzle in the Monday-morning forecast; conditions are dry with only mist/low clouds.\n- Safety expert: Ice formation risk rated “moderate” — patchy black ice on bridges, overpasses, and shaded side streets from refreeze, but not a widespread black-ice event.\n- Meteorologist: No sign of a Monday-morning icing event; temps are firmly below 32°F with no new precip.\n- Interpretation: This is standard West Michigan winter slickness, not the sort of severe ice that drives high closure rates. It raises caution, not probability of closure.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel confirms as of late Sunday night:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: no posted Monday closure/delay/e-learning notice; site still says return to class Monday after Thanksgiving break.\n  • Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview): no Monday closures or delays posted; calendars show normal Monday activities.\n  • No Kent ISD countywide advisory or closure wave.\n  • Social media sentiment: mixed/uncertain; people are hoping and speculating, but there is no clear community consensus or major media narrative that “schools will be closed Monday.”\n- According to the decision rules, 3+ neighboring districts closing would add 15–20 percentage points to the probability. Here, zero neighbors have announced closure, which supports keeping the probability at the low end.\n\n5. Historical and Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Forecast actual new snow Monday during school hours: 0\".\n- Calendar-day Monday snow: ~0.6\", after 9 PM, non-impactful for that day’s school operations.\n- Michigan thresholds from the brief:\n  • <4\" snow = 5–15% (routine for Michigan).\n  • 4–6\" = 15–35%.\n  • 6–8\" w/ good timing = 35–50%.\n  • 8+ or ice = 60–85%, etc.\n- While the weekend storm produced ~7–8\" total, the timing matters: it peaked Saturday/Sunday with a long cleanup window before school. For Monday’s decision, we’re in the “<4\" and no active storm” regime.\n- Historical analogs from the historian:\n  • Quiet, post-storm days with similar temps and light or no new snow show 5–10% snow-day rates.\n  • Additional evening-only light snow events (<2\") also show low closure rates (~5%).\n  • Seasonal adjustment: -0.15 (meaning conditions are actually even less likely than average to produce closures given how districts behave in early December).\n\n6. Weighting the four expert domains\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly supports a very low chance of closure since Monday is dry, with no commute-time snow/ice and only minor late-evening snow.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates road and walking conditions as fairly good, with moderate, typical winter risk and minimal impact to morning and afternoon commutes. This points to normal school operations.\n- History (20% weight): Past events with similar setups in West Michigan produce closures only ~5–10% of the time. This anchors the probability on the lower end of the Michigan thresholds.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight – the “secret weapon”): Shows no neighboring closures and no official Rockford signal of reconsidering Monday. Community chatter is cautious but not convinced of a snow day. This nudges probability down rather than up; we do not apply the +15–20% neighboring-closure bump because there is no closure wave.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside risk to closure probability (things that could increase it):\n  • An unforecast band of snow or freezing drizzle develops overnight, creating more widespread black ice or new accumulation before 6–8 AM.\n  • Plows fall behind in certain neighborhoods, leading to bus access issues on hills or tight residential streets that were assumed to be passable.\n  • A serious, late-breaking cluster of accidents or police/DOT advisories early Monday that persuades multiple districts to close or delay in a chain reaction.\n- Downside risk (overestimating closure chance):\n  • Roads end up cleaner/drier than expected and districts maintain full operations without issue, making the true closure probability closer to 2–5%.\n- Given good consistency across experts and solid plow timing, the main uncertainty is small and tied to rare forecast bust scenarios.\n\n8. Final probability and confidence\n- Baseline from history and Michigan thresholds: ~5–10% for a quiet post-storm day with <1\" new snow and no active warnings.\n- Meteorology and safety align with the low end of that range; nothing pushes it higher.\n- News intel finds no closure momentum, which keeps us from bumping the probability upward.\n- To stay decisive and avoid the 40–60% range, I place the final probability at 8% with a high confidence rating, reflecting strong agreement across domains and only modest residual uncertainty from potential forecast surprises.\n\nConclusion: Monday, Dec 1, 2025 in Rockford, MI is very likely to be a regular school day. Conditions are cold with slick spots, but not severe enough for a typical Michigan snow day given local standards and current signals.",
