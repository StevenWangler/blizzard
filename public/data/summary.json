  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Expert agreement:\n- All four domains (meteorology, safety, history, news) agree that the main winter storm peaks Saturday–Sunday and is effectively over 24+ hours before the Monday morning commute.\n- They all indicate Monday itself is cold, mostly dry, and calm with only negligible snow during/after the school day and no blizzard conditions.\n- All agree that Monday looks like a typical Michigan post-storm cleanup day, not a peak-impact or ongoing-storm day.\n\n2. Disagreements:\n- Meteorology and history both lean clearly toward a low closure probability (roughly 5–20%).\n- Safety flags a “moderate” risk due to packed snow/ice patches and walking hazards but still describes bus/road operations as feasible with minimal commute impact.\n- News/community sentiment is uncertain but does NOT show strong pressure or expectation for closures; there are no neighboring-district closure announcements or clear social chatter of “we’re definitely off Monday.” Overall, there is no expert explicitly arguing for a high closure chance.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Winter Storm Warning runs through Sunday morning (ending around 10:00 AM Sunday).\n- Monday first bell / bus windows are roughly 6:00–7:40 AM.\n- That gives on the order of 20–22 hours from warning end and 24+ hours from the heaviest snow for plows to clear highways, main bus routes, and lots.\n- Kent County and Rockford are well-practiced at this; with no new accumulating snow Monday morning, this timing strongly favors passable conditions by school start.\n\n4. Ice check:\n- Meteorology shows temps solidly below freezing with no mention of freezing rain or thaw/refreeze cycles—just continuous cold and some packed snow.\n- Safety notes only a “moderate” ice-formation risk in the sense of slick, compacted surfaces on untreated roads and sidewalks, not a glaze event.\n- There is no dedicated ice storm or mixed-precip threat. This keeps the probability much lower than the 60–85%+ range reserved for ice/8\"+ on a school day.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- Local news intelligence explicitly notes no closure announcements yet from Rockford or neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n- There is no indication of preemptive Monday closures anywhere nearby, and no pattern of widespread cancellations that would pressure Rockford to follow.\n- Under the rules, this means we do NOT apply the +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring closures.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Plowing underperforms on rural, gravel, or hilly bus routes, leaving them much worse than usual for a post-storm Monday (e.g., deep ruts, drifts, or uncleared subdivision streets).\n- A localized lake-effect band unexpectedly redevelops right over Rockford during the 4–7 AM window, adding several inches and reducing visibility.\n- Unforecast infrastructure issues (e.g., power outages at schools, frozen pipes, or parking lots still buried) force closure for reasons beyond pure weather.\n- A late-breaking shift in community/neighboring-district decisions (e.g., several big nearby districts close late Sunday night out of caution) might prompt Rockford to follow, despite passable conditions.\n\nWEIGHTED EXPERT SYNTHESIS:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates storm impacts are back-loaded to the weekend, with Monday cold but quiet, no accumulating snow during commute, light winds, and no ice. This points to a low closure probability, around 10–15%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates key roads and lots 7–8/10 and morning commute impact as minimal, while acknowledging moderate residual slickness and walking hazards. That suggests school is operational with routine caution, implying perhaps a 15–20% chance of closure if cleanup disappoints in some pockets.\n- History (20% weight): Analog patterns (“day-after-storm, mostly dry Monday” and “cold, cloudy day with <1\" new snow”) show 5–20% snow-day rates, leaning lower in early December when districts are less inclined to close without active hazards. This steers toward a base probability near 10–18%.\n- News & Community Intelligence (20% weight – the ‘secret weapon’): Coverage emphasizes the storm as a weekend problem with Monday framed as colder but quieter. There are no neighboring closure announcements, no power issues, and only “uncertain” social sentiment—no clear sense that “everybody thinks we’re off.” That argues AGAINST a large upward adjustment. Under the rules, we would add +15–20% for 3+ neighboring closures or +10–15% if the community clearly expected closure; neither condition is met. If anything, this supports staying at the lower end of the historical/meteorological range.\n\nINTEGRATED DECISION:\n- Start from historical + meteorological baseline for this pattern: ~10–18%.\n- Safety’s moderate risk but good ratings keep it from dropping lower than ~10% but do not justify mid or high probabilities.\n- News/community signals provide no upward bump (no closures, no strong expectation) and slightly reinforce confidence in operating normally.\n- This converges naturally near the low end of Michigan’s <4\" threshold band (5–15%).\n\nTo stay decisive and avoid an unnecessarily wide 40–60% band, the final call is set at 12%. This reflects that while a closure is not impossible (weekend-warning totals and rural cleanup are the wildcards), the most likely outcome by a clear margin is a normal, on-time school day.\n\nConclusion: With 24+ hours between peak storm impacts and the Monday commute, no new morning snow, no ice storm, and no strong neighboring or community pressure for closure, Rockford Public Schools are likely to be open on time Monday, Dec 1, 2025.",
