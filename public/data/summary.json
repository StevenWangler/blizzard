  "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT DO ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON?\n- Meteorologist: No new accumulating snow or ice for Rockford on Tuesday; main issue is freezing fog with localized slick spots and reduced visibility early.\n- Historian: Similar setups (freezing fog, patchy ice, no new precip) almost never produce snow days here (1–5% historically); closures in this region usually require heavy snow, real ice storms, or severe cold.\n- Safety analyst: Primary and secondary roads 7–8/10; morning commute impact \"moderate\" but clearly manageable with normal Michigan winter precautions; no justification for a full snow day.\n- News/community intel: No advance closure signals, no neighboring district closures, and local outlooks explicitly place the higher closure risk north and east of Grand Rapids, not in Rockford.\n\n⇒ Consensus: This is a marginal-nuisance, not a storm day. Schools almost certainly open, perhaps with extra caution.\n\n2. WHERE DO THEY DISAGREE?\n- The only mild tension is tone:\n  - Meteorology and history lean to VERY LOW closure odds (around 5%).\n  - Safety calls risk level \"moderate\" due to freezing fog/patchy black ice for the early commute, but still explicitly says conditions do not justify a snow day.\n  - News intel reports \"uncertain\" community sentiment, but not an expectation of closure.\n- Substantively, none of them argue for closure or even a likely delay; they differ only in how strongly they phrase the low risk.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW/ICE END TO 7:40 AM)\n- Meteorology: No new snow or freezing rain into Tuesday; earlier mixed-precip/advisory event is focused on late Sunday into Monday and expires Monday morning.\n- By the target day (Tuesday 2026-01-06), plows and salt crews have:\n  - The rest of Monday daytime + Monday night to clean up any residual issues.\n  - That’s well over 18–24 hours between the end of meaningful precip and the Tuesday 7:40 AM bell.\n- During that interval, temperatures hover near freezing with traffic and salt working, which favors gradual improvement, not worsening.\n⇒ Plow/salt timing is strongly favorable for having roads in decent shape by Tuesday morning.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- There was some light glaze / mixed precip risk VERY EARLY Monday (previous day), especially north of Rockford.\n- For Tuesday itself:\n  - No active freezing rain, no accumulating snow, no Tuesday advisory.\n  - Ice risk is from **residual moisture + freezing fog**:\n    - Thin, patchy black ice on untreated side streets, bridges, parking lots.\n    - Rime on exposed surfaces (trees, railings, steps).\n- Safety assessment labels ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but still expects mostly wet-to-slick surfaces, not system-wide dangerous glaze.\n- Critically: there is **no true ice storm, no new heavy icing event, and no indication of widespread impassable roads.**\n⇒ Ice is present as a localized hazard, but nowhere near the threshold that usually drives Michigan closures.\n\n5. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS DOING?\n- News intel:\n  - No confirmed neighboring district closures or pre-announced delays for Tuesday.\n  - TV closing lists have not posted Tuesday-specific widespread closures.\n  - Local school-closing outlook sites emphasize higher risk well north of Grand Rapids; Rockford/Kent County is on the southern edge of impacts.\n- The explicit rule: 3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20% probability. Right now it’s 0.\n⇒ No positive adjustment from neighboring districts; if anything, the lack of buzz reinforces a low-closure baseline.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nMain ways this forecast could bust HIGHER (i.e., surprise closure or delay):\n- The freezing fog becomes much denser and more persistent than modeled:\n  - If visibility stays near-zero across a wide area right at bus time (6–8 AM) instead of improving, some districts might call a 2-hour delay purely for safety.\n- Temperatures verify 1–2°F colder than expected:\n  - That could turn more of the damp pavement into black ice, making secondary and rural roads much worse than anticipated.\n- An un-forecast light freezing drizzle or lake-effect band sets up over Rockford overnight:\n  - Even a few hundredths of ice accretion could sharply increase crash risk and prompt late calls.\n\nWays I could bust LOWER (i.e., overestimating risk):\n- Fog is patchy, not dense, and visibility is mostly >1–2 miles by 6–7 AM.\n- Road treatment is especially effective Monday night, leaving most routes just wet.\n- Community and media end up treating this simply as a routine January morning.\n\nGiven all that, the most credible failure mode is **a short fog/ice-related delay**, not a full-day closure.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates no new precip, marginal temps, and improving visibility by commute. This alone argues for a very low closure probability (~5–10%).\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as manageable with moderate risk and explicitly says they do not justify a snow day; this supports the same low range but highlights a small chance of a delay if conditions locally worsen.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show 1–5% closure rate for similar setups. This pulls the forecast slightly **downward** from any instinctive overreaction to the word \"ice\".\n- News Intelligence (20%): The \"secret weapon\" shows no neighboring closures, no strong social expectation of a snow day, and professional outlooks downplaying risk for Rockford. That reinforces the **low end** of any plausible range.\n\nNUMERICAL DECISION:\n- Michigan thresholds emphasize that without 4\"+ of snow or major ice, probabilities should stay low. Here we have **0\" new snow and no active ice storm.**\n- Meteorology and history center around ~5%. Safety, accounting for fog/patchy ice, arguably nudges that up a hair (to maybe 7–10%) for the chance of a surprise delay/closure if conditions overperform.\n- News intelligence does **not** provide any upward adjustment triggers (no neighboring closures, no strong closure sentiment).\n\nBalancing all four, I set the **full snow-day probability at 7%** (schools closed all day), with high confidence that school will be open and at most a small chance of a short delay if freezing fog is worse than modeled.\n\nThis stays clear of the 40–60% \"mushy middle\" and should score well on Brier accuracy against the Rockford stats students if the day proceeds as the consensus forecast suggests.",
