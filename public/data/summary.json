  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist: Heavy, warning-level snow ends by late Sunday morning; Monday itself is cold but quiet, with **no accumulating snow during 6–9 AM or 2–5 PM** and only about 0.6\" late Monday evening.\n- Historian: This is a classic **day-after-storm** pattern in West Michigan. Historical snow day rates for similar setups (post-storm cleanup, no new commute snow, temps in teens–20s°F, light winds) are **5–15%**.\n- Safety Analyst: Rates Monday morning road conditions as **8–8.5/10** for primary/secondary roads, with only moderate residual risk from packed snow and refreeze. Labels morning and afternoon commute impact as **minimal**.\n- News/Intel: Rockford Public Schools’ official site says students **return Monday Dec 1**; there are **no closure/delay notices**. No neighboring Kent County districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have posted Monday closures. Community chatter focuses on the weekend storm, not Monday shutdowns.\n\nAll four experts converge on: **roads improving, no active Monday storm, typical Michigan winter operations, and no current closure signals.**\n\n2. ANY CONFLICTS?\n- Meteorology mentions a Winter Storm Warning and 7–11\" totals, but explicitly states the warning **expires Sunday morning and does not cover the Monday commute**.\n- Safety flags **moderate ice formation risk** from refreeze, but simultaneously scores drivable conditions (7–8.5/10) and calls commute impact minimal.\n- News/Intel notes that Metro Detroit outlets are tracking Monday closures, but those are **regional, not Kent County/Rockford**, and no local closure wave is seen.\n\nThese are not true conflicts; they’re consistent: **big weekend storm, but it’s over by Sunday, and Monday is a clean-up normal school day.**\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (END OF SNOW → 7:40 AM MONDAY)\n- Heavy snow under the Winter Storm Warning ends around **Sunday ~10:00 AM**.\n- Assume high school bus routes start ~**6:00–6:30 AM Monday**, with classes near **7:40 AM**.\n- Time from end of warning-level snow (Sun 10 AM) to first buses (Mon 6 AM): **~20 hours**.\n- Time to first bell (~7:40 AM): **~21.5 hours**.\n\nWith that window, Kent County crews can:\n- Plow and salt primary routes multiple passes on Sunday.\n- Work through secondary and neighborhood streets Sunday and overnight.\n\nThe safety analyst’s high road scores (8–8.5/10) confirm this math: by Monday morning, roads are **snow-packed but routinely passable**, not emergency-level.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no mixed precip, **no new icing event** on Monday; just cold, dry conditions and late, light snow.\n- Safety: Notes **refreeze/spotty ice** from Sunday melt, with emphasis on hardpack and slick spots on neighborhood streets, parking lots, and sidewalks.\n\nSo there **is ice**, but it’s the usual **static hardpack/black ice** after a storm, not an **ongoing ice storm or glaze event**. Under the provided Michigan thresholds, that does **not** reach the “ice storm / significant icing” category that would push probabilities into the 60–90% range.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / REAL-TIME SIGNALS\n- News/Intel: No closure announcements found for **Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD** for Monday.\n- Rockford PS site explicitly says **school resumes Monday**, and there is **no weather banner or alert**.\n- Some Metro Detroit coverage is tracking Monday closures, but there is **no parallel closure drumbeat** in West Michigan.\n\nPer your weighting rules, neighboring districts **not** closing and the absence of local closure chatter **supports staying at the low end**, not bumping probability up.\n\n6. WEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Calls conditions quiet on Monday, no commute snow, no advisory, and states low snow day probability. This pulls strongly toward **low single-digit to low-teens**.\n- Safety Analyst (25%): Rates roads 7–8.5/10, commute impact minimal, with only moderate residual risk from hardpack/ice. This reinforces a **low closure likelihood**.\n- Historian (20%): Historical analogs: 5%, 10%, and 15% closure rates for comparable patterns. Average historical risk **~10%**.\n- News/Intel (20% – secret weapon): No closure alerts, no neighboring district closures, and official language about returning Monday. Community sentiment is “uncertain,” not panicked or demanding closure. This again supports **low odds**.\n\nCombining these:\n- Meteorology: ~8–12%\n- Safety: ~10–15% (acknowledging some ice risk)\n- History: ~10%\n- News: ~5–10%\nWeighted blend lands very naturally in the **~10%** range.\n\n7. ALIGNMENT WITH MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- New snow for Monday: **<1\"** (0.6\"), and that’s **late evening**, not during commute.\n- Active storm/warning: Ends Sunday morning; **no Monday warning/advisory** in effect.\n- Temps: Teens at the bus stop, 20s afternoon; **nowhere near dangerous cold thresholds**.\n- No blizzard, no ice storm, no 8\"+ event during commute.\n\nYour Michigan guide:\n- **<4\" snow = 5–15%**. We’re well under 4\" with **no commute snow at all**.\n\nGiven the high local tolerance and solid plow capacity, a **10%** snow day probability sits squarely and defensibly in that band.\n\n8. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey ways this could fail:\n- **Overnight lake-effect band surprises the area**, dropping several inches (e.g., 3–6\") between midnight and 7 AM with poor visibility. That would increase risk toward **35–50%** or higher.\n- **Widespread black ice** develops beyond expectations (e.g., hidden refreeze on hills and bus routes) leading to multiple early-morning crash reports and forcing a late closure decision.\n- **Late policy/PR pivot**: If several neighboring Kent County districts suddenly announce closures pre-dawn Monday due to lingering conditions, Rockford might follow for consistency even if conditions are marginally manageable.\n- **Undetected infrastructure issue**: power outages or major drifting in a particular part of the district could drive an operational closure despite generally decent roads.\n\nBased on the given data, these appear **possible but not likely**, so the prediction remains skewed low rather than mid-range.\n\n9. FINAL DECISION\n- Snow Day Probability (Rockford, MI – Monday, Dec 1, 2025): **10%**.\n- Interpretation: **School is very likely to be open** under normal winter operations. Conditions warrant caution and slower travel, not cancellation.\n\nThis avoids the 40–60% no-man’s-land; the evidence does **not** show major expert conflict or active Monday hazards that would justify a higher range.",
