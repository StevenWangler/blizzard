    "Light winds and (per meteorologist hourlies) bus-time wind chills ~8–10°F → not near -15°F to -20°F closure thresholds",
    "Infrastructure view: main highways/county roads likely clear/treated; remaining risk concentrated on subdivision streets, bridges, shaded/low-lying corridors and parking lots",

  "decision_rationale": "Base case (most likely): Rockford is OPEN. All core experts (meteorology/history/safety/news/infrastructure/power) agree this is not a plowable snow event: forecast snowfall is 0\" with light winds and no storm warnings. The only credible operational hazard is freezing fog/mist in the pre-dawn window, which can create patchy glaze (bridges/ramps/subdivision streets/parking lots) and localized visibility drops near bus time.\n\nWhere the analyses conflict: the Web Weather Verification flagged a critical ≤-20°F wind chill based on a Weather.com locale-variant crawl with stale timestamps and likely unit ambiguity (°C vs °F). That conflicts with (1) the meteorologist’s bus-hour wind chill estimate (~8–10°F), (2) the same verifier’s Weather.com US-unit page showing only about -13 to -16°F ‘feels like’, and (3) the NWS-style text forecast indicating wind chills nearer -8°F. Given the internal inconsistency and staleness in the extreme value, I am not treating ≤-20°F as the operative hazard for this specific decision. Instead, I treat the credible, consistent signal as: cold but not dangerously extreme wind chill, with fog/black-ice as the main risk.\n\nPlow timing math: with no new snow expected, roads should not be degrading from snowfall during the commute. Infrastructure expects primary corridors clear already; local streets/parking lots should be improving by ~6:30–7:30 AM. That points more toward a possible 2-hour delay trigger (if fog/ice verifies widely) than a full closure.\n\nNews/community tiebreaker: there is no domino effect showing yet (FOX 17 closings page shows none active; nearby districts show no closure banners). That strongly suppresses full-closure odds in Michigan for a ‘patchy hazard’ day.\n\nBottom line: I’m setting full closure at 10% (low, but not near-zero) to account for the non-trivial chance that freezing fog becomes widespread enough (<1/4 mile visibility across many routes) and/or spotters find pervasive glazing on secondary roads before 6:30 AM. If that does not verify, it’s open (possibly with a targeted delay).",
