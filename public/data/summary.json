    "Forecast signal is for only ~1 inch of snow ending Sunday early afternoon, leaving ~16+ hours for plowing/salting before Monday bus routes (strong ‘stay open’ signal in Michigan).",
    "Main risk is NOT snow depth but spotty ice/black-ice on secondary/rural roads, bridges, shaded stretches, and in parking lots from refreeze and possible residual glaze from the prior advisory.",
    "No confirmed ‘domino effect’ yet: no Rockford/Forest Hills/GRPS/Lowell/Cedar Springs closure announcements found; closings boards show no early cascade in available crawl.",
    "Wind/visibility are not in blizzard territory (light winds, localized visibility reductions only).",
    "Wind-chill web data is conflicting; despite one binding flag in the web verifier, the underlying snippet appears unit/integrity-confused and is not corroborated by the meteorologist’s Monday AM estimate (teens, light wind). Therefore I am NOT treating this as a verified ≤-20°F bus-hour wind chill event."

  "decision_rationale": "Integrating the experts: Meteorology + history strongly point to a routine West Michigan winter outcome—light snow (~1 inch) occurs Sunday late morning to early afternoon and ends around 2 PM, giving an unusually long cleanup window before Monday’s 6–8 AM bus routes. Infrastructure agrees on the plow-timing math (≈16.5 hours from snow end to bus time) and expects trunklines and primary county/bus routes to be clear to mostly clear by 6:30 AM, with only neighborhood streets lagging.\n\nThe upward risk comes from Safety and News: there is credible regional evidence of icing sensitivity (e.g., Greenville closing Friday for icy roads/sidewalks; prior advisory mentions glaze/freezing drizzle). That raises the chance Monday morning has patchy black ice on less-traveled roads and in lots—conditions that more often trigger a 2-hour delay than a full closure in Michigan.\n\nKey conflict: the Web Weather Verification includes a critical flag citing Weather.com showing “Feels Like -26°” around 6–8 AM, but the verifier also notes inconsistent locale renders and unclear unit context, and the meteorologist’s Monday estimate does not support extreme-cold thresholds. Because this looks like a data-integrity/unit issue rather than a confirmed -20°F-or-colder bus-hour wind chill for Feb 9, I do not apply the automatic 90–95% rule here. If ANY credible source is clearly showing ≤-20°F (in °F) for Rockford during 6–8 AM on Monday, the probability should be immediately revised upward to 90–95%.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for closures, no confirmed closure cascade, and strong plow timing, I land at 24% for a full snow day (closure). The more likely operational outcome, if conditions are worse than expected on back roads, is a 2-hour delay rather than a closure.",
