  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • Meteorologist, safety analyst, and historian all indicate that the primary impactful weather is on Dec 30 evening into just after midnight, not during the Dec 31 morning commute.\n  • All three agree that additional snow for Dec 31 itself is light (~0.5–1\"), that winds by commute time are moderate, and that visibility improves to 4–6+ miles.\n  • Safety and meteorology agree accumulating snow effectively ends by about 1–2 AM, with dry, overcast conditions 3–8 AM.\n  • All experts concur: conditions at 6–8 AM are \"typical West Michigan winter\"—cold, some packed snow/ice, but not storm-level.\n  • History analysis: this setup (post-icing, light wraparound snow, cold but not extreme) has only ~5–10% historical closure rate.\n  • News intel: no current closures/delays, and community tone is about a messy commute, not shutdown expectations.\n\n- DISAGREEMENTS / NUANCES:\n  • No major direct conflicts—differences are only in emphasis. News coverage sounds more dramatic because it includes the earlier advisory period (2–5\" snow, strong winds) but that primarily applies to Monday–Tuesday, not the specific Wednesday morning window.\n  • Meteorology gives total overnight new snow on the lighter side (~0.5\"); cross-check allows for up to ~1\". This doesn’t move us into any higher Michigan closure threshold.\n  • Ice risk: meteorology and history call it a moderate residual risk from prior freezing rain; safety agrees but notes standard salting should control it. No one is calling for widespread, untreated glaze ice by morning.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- From cross-checked safety analysis:\n  • Worst conditions: ~9–10 PM Dec 30 to ~1:00 AM Dec 31.\n  • Accumulating snow is effectively done by ~2:00 AM.\n  • From 2:00 AM to the 7:40 AM high-school start: ~5.5 hours of dry time for focused cleanup.\n  • From midnight to 7:40 AM: ~7.5 total hours with only the first 1–2 hours still accumulating.\n- This exceeds the typical 3–4+ hour window plow crews need in Kent County to have primaries and main secondaries in good shape. Scores of 8/10 (primaries) and 7/10 (secondaries/parking lots) match that.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Prior event included freezing rain/mixed precip on Dec 30, giving a patchy icy base under new snow.\n- Overnight temps stay in the 20s°F (well below freezing) with no new liquid icing, so surfaces remain frozen but not re-glazing from fresh rain.\n- Salt effectiveness: mid-20s°F is within an effective range for treated roads, particularly on primary routes.\n- Safety analyst: untreated ice concern is localized (side streets, lot edges) but not widespread; this is described as a typical post-event slick morning, not a closure-level ice storm.\n- Ice is the main possible wild card, but all experts converge on it being manageable with normal operations, not \"ice changes everything\" severity.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- FOX 17 closings board: no active K–12 closures or delays in West Michigan late night Dec 30.\n- Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta (MI), Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD: no official closure/delay notices on sites or feeds.\n- Community sentiment from news intel: \"expecting_school\"—people foresee a slow, slick commute but not an obvious snow day.\n- Under the weighting rules, the absence of neighbor closures means **no positive adjustment** to the probability; if there had been 3+ neighbors closed, we would add +15–20 percentage points.\n\n5. Michigan closure thresholds vs. this event\n- New accumulation tied to the school day: ~0.5–1\" overnight, then essentially dry by morning.\n- This is in the \"<4\" snow\" bucket, which historically maps to roughly 5–15% snow day probability in Michigan.\n- No fresh ice storm and no blizzard/whiteout for the commute window; wind gusts near commute time are not extreme.\n- Wind chills in low teens are routine and far from the ~-15°F threshold that often drives cold-related closures.\n- Historical analogs clearly support a low closure rate: 5–10% for very similar patterns.\n\n6. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors school open—light new snow, improved visibility, and several plow hours. This alone suggests a low closure probability (~5–10%).\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates roads and walking conditions as manageable (7–8/10), with only moderate residual ice risk and \"minimal\" commute impact. This aligns with a normal school day, maybe ~5–15% closure probability driven only by potential localized issues.\n- History (20% weight): Explicit 5–10% historical snow-day rate for analogous setups and a -10 seasonal adjustment (meaning this is typical, not exceptional). This pulls probability down rather than up.\n- News Intel (20% weight): No neighboring closures, no strong community expectation of a snow day, sentiment is \"school as normal unless overnight surprises.\" That again anchors us at the low end of the 5–15% band.\n\nCombining these: all four weighted perspectives cluster near the **bottom** of Michigan’s <4\" snow range. The only uncertain factor is how much residual ice persists on untreated surfaces, but safety and meteorology both indicate it should be manageable with standard overnight treatment.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside (more closures than expected):\n  • If late-night bands produce significantly more snow than forecast (e.g., an extra 3–4\" of lake-effect by dawn) and plows can’t fully catch up.\n  • If the prior freezing rain was more substantial than modeled, leading to widespread black ice under a thin snow cover that salt can’t fully mitigate by morning.\n  • If a last-minute NWS advisory specifically targeting the Wednesday morning commute is issued, prompting superintendents to act conservatively.\n- Downside (schools even more confident to open):\n  • If actual snow ends earlier or totals are even lighter than projected, leaving roads mostly wet/treated and easily drivable.\n\nGiven the current data—including cross-checked timing and no neighboring closures—the overall likelihood that Rockford declares a snow day for Wed Dec 31, 2025 is low. A point estimate of **8%** places us squarely in the lower half of the 5–15% band, consistent with all expert inputs and community signals, while acknowledging a small chance of overnight surprises.\n\nTherefore, the coordinated decision is: **Rockford Public Schools are very likely to be open on time with standard winter cautions, and a weather-driven snow day is unlikely.**",
