  "decision_rationale": "Synthesizing the three inputs, Rockford is in a classic advisory-level lake-effect/clipper backside pattern: temps around 28–31°F, 48+ hours below freezing, gusty WNW winds, and light additional snow (about 1\" or less) with intermittent freezing drizzle. That is enough for slick roads—especially bridges, overpasses, and rural back roads—but not enough for a classic Michigan closure scenario.\n\nMeteorology: The dataset emphasizes limited QPF (~0.04\"), minimal new accumulation, and improving conditions by the next morning commute with winds backing off somewhat and visibility generally good outside of brief bands. There is no signal for 4\"+ of new snow in Rockford itself, and the ice signal is light and patchy, not a solid glaze. This falls well below the 6–8\" or ice-storm criteria that would support probabilities above the 35–50% range in the Michigan-specific thresholds.\n\nHistory: The closest analog patterns show snow day rates in the 20–30% range, and seasonal context notes that Rockford typically remains open in advisory setups with 0–2\" additional snow unless an intense band parks over the district at dawn or prior ice is severely untreated. Here, the heavy warning-level snow is focused north and south, bracketing but not targeting Kent County. Seasonal adjustment is negative (–0.15), reinforcing that this is a ‘typical’ early-winter nuisance event rather than an outlier.\n\nSafety: The safety assessment rates roads and driving at moderate risk, with significant impact to the morning commute but still explicitly characterizes the situation as borderline and not an automatic closure. With well-practiced plow/salt operations in Kent County and no extreme cold or deep snow, the baseline expectation in this region is that school operates with caution.\n\nGiven all of this, a snow day is clearly possible but not the most likely outcome. To stay decisive relative to the grading scheme and Michigan thresholds, I place the probability near the lower end of the historical 20–30% range—22%—reflecting: (1) non-trivial icing risk and localized band uncertainty (keeps it above 15%), but (2) low total accumulation, advisory-level impacts, and improving conditions by commute time (keeps it below 30%).",
