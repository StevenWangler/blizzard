  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, dry, seasonably cold day with essentially 0% chance of snow or freezing rain, no accumulation, light winds, and visibility ~6 miles despite some freezing fog/mist pre‑dawn.\n- Historian: Very strong historical signal that this pattern (near‑freezing overcast, no active storm, light winds) almost never produces snow days in West Michigan (1–3% range). No blizzard, no ice storm, no extreme cold.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads largely dry; only isolated black-ice risk on bridges/ramps with high humidity and freezing fog between ~4–9 AM. Recommends normal schedule and explicitly states conditions do NOT justify a snow day or delay.\n- News Intel: Rockford Public Schools is already on Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 4, so there is no instructional day on Dec 24. Neighboring districts are likewise on holiday schedules, not issuing weather closures. No alerts or media showing a storm or regional closing wave.\nAll four converge on: no storm, routine winter conditions, and no need for a weather-based closure.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- Meteorology and Safety align: dry weather, only localized slick-spot risk, not a system-wide hazard.\n- History supports their view with very low historical closure rates.\n- News Intel adds that the calendar itself removes the need for a snow-day decision. This doesn’t conflict with any other expert; it simply makes the weather question largely moot.\nThus, no cross-check tools are needed; the narrative is internally consistent.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Forecast snow/ice accumulation: 0\" (no measurable precip). Plows have essentially nothing to clear beyond routine monitoring.\n- Worst window per safety analyst: 04:00–09:00 with freezing fog/mist and near‑freezing temps.\n- Rockford high school start is typically ~7:40 AM; however, there is no snow to remove. Any minor glazing risk develops and persists during the same 4–9 AM window, but this is handled by pretreating lots/sidewalks and cautious driving, not by cancelling school.\n- Effective plow/maintenance requirement from “end of event” to 7:40 AM is irrelevant here because there is no event.\n\n4. ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no accumulating precipitation. Only mention is freezing fog/mist with temps ~31°F.\n- Safety: Calls ice-formation risk “moderate” in a very targeted sense: black ice on bridges, ramps, shaded curves, and untreated sidewalks during 4–9 AM. This is the typical West Michigan winter-morning caution scenario, not an ice storm.\n- Historian: Notes that Michigan districts rarely cancel for patchy or marginal freezing conditions alone; closures require broad, clearly hazardous ice or snow.\nConclusion: There is some localized, manageable ice risk, but not a storm-level ice event. That keeps us far below the 60–85% “8+ inches OR ice storm” threshold in the rubric.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford: Officially closed for Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 4; no weather alerts or closure messages.\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville): Kent ISD-wide calendars also show these dates as holiday break. No evidence of weather-based closures.\n- Media: Fox 17 closings page has no active school closings or delays tied to weather. County alerts list only holiday closures.\n- Social/media sentiment: Labeled \"no_buzz\"—no chatter indicating concern about a storm or dangerous travel.\nTherefore, there is no regional storm closure wave and no basis to apply the +15–20% neighboring-closure bump or +10–15% community-expectation bump.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\nKey ways I could miss:\n- A surprise onset of freezing drizzle or light freezing rain overnight that was not in guidance, causing widespread glazing rather than localized patches.\n- Fog becoming denser than forecast (e.g., near-whiteout freezing fog) drastically reducing visibility across the district during the exact bus window.\n- An unanticipated equipment or power issue (unrelated to weather) leading to operational closure—outside the scope of a weather-based prediction.\nGiven current data (no alerts, no model signal for precipitation), these failure modes are low probability but are why the forecast isn’t 0%.\n\n7. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates essentially zero snow/ice storm risk and routine cold. This heavily suppresses closure probability.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates road and driving conditions as generally good with only moderate, localized risk and explicitly advises no snow day or delay. This reinforces the very low probability.\n- History (20% weight): Historical snow-day rates for analog days are 1–3%. This creates a strong prior anchoring near the bottom of the scale.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight – \"secret weapon\"): Confirms that Dec 24 is a scheduled break day and that no neighboring districts are closing for weather. Since closures are holiday-based and not storm-driven, there is no reason to add probability for a weather-related “snow day.” If anything, the lack of buzz and wave keeps the probability on the floor of the Michigan threshold bands.\n\n8. NUMERIC PROBABILITY DECISION\nUsing the Michigan thresholds:\n- Total snow <4\": base 5–15%. Here, snow is 0\" with no storm, and there is no active school day to close.\n- Historical analogs: 1–3% for weather-caused snow days.\n- Local safety: explicitly says no closure/delay warranted.\n- News intel: no neighboring weather closures; calendar closure only.\nI anchor on the historical/safety consensus (~2–3%) and the total lack of an operational decision (because of break) pushes me to the very bottom of the plausible range. I therefore set:\n- Snow day probability (weather-caused) = 2%.\nThis avoids the 40–60% “mushy middle” and reflects a decisive, very-low-risk stance, consistent with all four expert domains.\n",
