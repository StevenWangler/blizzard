    "Rockford Public Schools is already officially CLOSED Monday Feb 16, 2026 for scheduled Mid-Winter Break (district calendar/news/superintendent update confirm; school resumes Tue Feb 17).",
    "Weather forecast shows no accumulating snow/precipitation and no extreme cold wind chills—so no weather-driven closure trigger is present anyway.",
    "Primary weather hazard is freezing fog/patchy black ice risk around ~4:00–8:30 AM; this would more typically support advisories or, on a normal school day, a possible delay—not a full closure.",
    "Infrastructure status indicates roads generally clear with spot-treat needs only; power grid/outage risk is very low and stable.",
    "No community buzz, no outage reports, and neighboring “closures” for Feb 16 appear calendar-related (break), not weather-related."
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "This “snow day” is effectively moot for Rockford Public Schools because Monday, Feb 16, 2026 is a scheduled no-school day for Mid-Winter Break, confirmed via multiple official district sources (district calendar, district news post, and superintendent update stating school resumes Feb 17). Even if we ignore the calendar and assess weather-only, the meteorology shows 0\" snow/0 precip, light winds, and feels-like temps in the 20s—not an extreme cold closure case. The only meaningful hazard is freezing fog with potential patchy black ice and reduced visibility around 4:00–8:30 AM; historically and operationally in West Michigan, that tends to produce cautions or at most a delay if visibility drops well below ~0.5 mile or glaze becomes widespread. Infrastructure and power-grid signals do not suggest an event that would force closure. Therefore the probability of a weather-driven closure decision for Rockford on Feb 16 is near-zero; I retain 1% only as a guard against a user targeting a different school/day or an unforeseen, unforecast icing event.",
