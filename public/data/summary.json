  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorology & safety agree that:\n  • The heavy snow and worst whiteout conditions peaked Monday and very early overnight, leaving 6–14\" on the ground with drifts.\n  • From roughly midnight–6 AM Tuesday, Rockford sees primarily LIGHT freezing drizzle/light freezing rain, not new heavy snow.\n  • Temperatures stay near or below 0°F with wind chills roughly -15°F to -25°F through the early morning.\n  • Visibility improves by bus time (3–6+ miles), but roads remain slick, rutted, and icy.\n- Historian agrees that:\n  • This is a classic “day-after-big-storm” setup: cold, cleanup mode, lingering slick roads, and marginal-but-not-record wind chills.\n  • Such patterns in West Michigan yield a moderate snow-day rate (roughly 40–60%), especially when a Winter Storm Warning ends near the commute.\n- News intelligence agrees that:\n  • Travel across West Michigan has been hazardous, with widespread closures Monday and continued poor conditions expected into Tuesday.\n  • Community sentiment is “expecting_closure”; specialized school-closings outlooks explicitly call Tuesday closures ‘likely’ in rural/west-of-131 districts like Rockford.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist: Leans toward “high chance of delays/selective closures” but only a moderate chance of a full district-wide snow day, mainly because additional Tuesday accumulation is tiny and visibility improves.\n- Historian: Puts this pattern in a moderate-closure band (0.4–0.6 historical closure rate), slightly higher than the meteorologist’s “moderate” feel, due to the combination of warning-level totals, residual drifts, and cold.\n- Safety analyst: Rates risk as HIGH, emphasizing severe ice-formation risk on top of deep snowpack, and significant morning commute impacts even with several hours of plowing.\n- News intel: Official Tuesday decisions aren’t broadly posted yet, but community and media expectations lean strongly toward more closures; the coverage suggests conditions are perceived locally as serious enough to justify another round of snow days.\n\nThere is no direct conflict on the *facts* of the weather. The main tension is interpretive: meteorology sees ‘manageable but rough’ by commute, while safety, history, and community signals push toward ‘this will likely close schools again.’\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Cross-check + safety analyst:\n  • Light freezing drizzle predominates from about 12–6 AM.\n  • Heavy snow is largely over before this period; overnight is mainly glaze on top of existing snowpack.\n  • Crews can work essentially all night; effective treatment windows:\n    - Primary roads: ~4–6 effective hours of plow/salt focus before first buses (≈6:45–7:00 AM), yielding condition ≈4/5 – mostly clear but with slick spots and black ice on bridges/ramps.\n    - Secondary/rural roads: ~2–4 effective hours, delayed behind primaries, yielding ≈3/5 – plowed but rutted/hard-packed with frequent ice and narrowed lanes.\n    - Parking lots/sidewalks: lag the roads; around 2/5 by 7:00–7:30 AM – plowed but very icy and slick.\n- Functionally, there are around 2–3 hours between meaningful tapering of precip (≈4–5 AM) and the start of the bus window, but crews are already active well before that. Even so, extreme cold sharply limits salt effectiveness, so quality, not quantity, of treatment is the constraint.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Cross-check confirms: YES, and it’s the dominant hazard.\n  • Model shows light freezing rain/drizzle, not snow, nearly every hour from midnight–6 AM.\n  • Air temps -5°F to +5°F, wind chills -15°F to -25°F, with road temps extremely cold.\n  • Even light liquid at those temps produces *highly efficient glaze* over already packed snow.\n- Safety analyst explicitly labels ice-formation risk as “severe.”\n- This combination (deep snowpack + overnight freezing drizzle + subzero pavement temps) promotes:\n  • Black ice on main roads where salt is marginal.\n  • Highly polished, icy ruts and drifts on secondaries and rural bus routes.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- Confirmed:\n  • Forest Hills Public Schools (large neighboring district) closed Monday for inclement weather, signaling superintendents are already willing to close aggressively for this system.\n  • Kent ISD facilities and programs closed Monday for weather.\n- For TUESDAY specifically (as of late evening Monday):\n  • Major TV closings pages and Kent ISD show very few, if any, confirmed Tuesday school decisions yet; most nearby districts (Rockford, Sparta, Cedar Springs, Kenowa Hills, Northview) have *not* posted Tuesday closures or delays yet.\n  • However, regional closing outlooks and chatter say Tuesday closures are ‘likely,’ especially for rural/west-of-131 and exurban districts, including Rockford.\n- Interpretation:\n  • We do NOT yet have “3+ neighboring districts closed for Tuesday” confirmed, so we should *not* apply the full +15–20% neighboring-closure bump.\n  • We DO have one large neighbor already closed for weather on Monday and strong expectation of more closures Tuesday, which justifies a smaller upward nudge from news/community factors.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Overestimate scenario (predict too high):\n  • Plows and salters overperform: primaries are nearly bare-dry; secondaries better than 3/5; parking lots reasonably safe by 6:30–7:00 AM.\n  • Freezing drizzle underperforms or cuts off earlier than expected, limiting glaze.\n  • Superintendent, seeing improved roads at 4–5 AM and only marginally dangerous wind chills at bus time, opts for a normal day or a 2-hour delay instead of full closure.\n- Underestimate scenario (predict too low):\n  • Freezing drizzle persists or is slightly heavier, producing more widespread glaze than modeled.\n  • Drifting and rutted hardpack on rural routes remain borderline impassable for buses in spots.\n  • Multiple neighboring Kent County districts announce closures early, creating both safety and political cover for Rockford to close.\n  • Wind chills stay closer to -15°F to -20°F at the *actual* bus times, pushing conditions toward the cold-closure threshold.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Signals moderate full-closure risk, higher delay/partial-closure risk.\n  • Given: deep snowpack + warning + ice + dangerous cold, but improving visibility and no new heavy snow.\n  • Alone, this would suggest something like ~45–50% snow-day probability.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Labels overall risk HIGH; emphasizes severe black ice plus deep snowpack, secondary roads 3/5, parking lots 2/5.\n  • Specifically notes significant morning commute impact and emergency-access concerns.\n  • Safety perspective alone implies something like ~65–75% probability of *not* running a normal day (closure or at least major delay), with a strong case for full closure over marginal operation, especially for a district with rural routes.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Similar pattern closure rates: 0.4, 0.55, 0.6, with medium confidence.\n  • Seasonality adjustment (-0.1) reflects Michigan’s higher tolerance, but this event still sits in the mid-to-upper historical band because of warning-level storm totals plus ice.\n  • Historically, the ‘day after big storm, warning to 7 AM, residual drifting/ice, marginal wind chills’ setup gives perhaps ~50–60% closure in districts like Rockford with rural routes.\n\n- News intelligence (20% weight – secret weapon):\n  • Community sentiment: “expecting_closure” – that adds a meaningful upward pressure (roughly +10–15% vs pure weather/historical numbers).\n  • Specialized local school-closing outlook explicitly says Tuesday closures are ‘likely’ in areas including Rockford.\n  • Neighboring-district *precedent* (Forest Hills Monday closure) and region-wide ‘travel not recommended’ messages suggest superintendents are primed to err on the side of safety.\n  • However, because we do NOT yet have confirmed *Tuesday* closures from 3+ neighboring districts, we should NOT apply the full +15–20% ‘closure domino’ bump.\n\nINTEGRATED PROBABILITY ESTIMATE\n1) Baseline from meteorology alone: ~45–50% (moderate, leaning toward delay/partial closure rather than guaranteed snow day).\n2) Adjust up for safety’s emphasis on severe ice and high commute risk: +10–15 points → ~55–65%.\n3) Historical closure patterns for this kind of event in West Michigan push toward the upper half of that range: +5–10 points → ~60–70%.\n4) News & community signals (‘expecting_closure,’ local closing outlooks calling Tuesday closures ‘likely’), but WITHOUT confirmed multi-district Tuesday closures yet: +5–10 points → ends up ~65–78%.\n\nTo stay competitive (minimizing Brier score) and avoid the discouraged 40–60% middle band, I place Rockford’s **full snow day** probability at **72%**:\n- High enough to reflect the substantial ice hazard, deep snowpack, warning-level context, and strong expectation of closures.\n- Not so high as to assume a closure is a near-certainty, acknowledging that Michigan districts sometimes push through similar conditions with delays or normal starts.\n\nTIMELINE SYNTHESIS\n- Conditions_start (worst commute-relevant hazards):\n  • Around **2026-01-20T00:00:00-05:00**: light freezing drizzle begins over an already snowy surface; winds 10–16 mph W–WNW, wind chills near -20°F.\n- Peak_impact_time:\n  • **≈3:00 AM–6:00 AM** (centered near **2026-01-20T03:00:00-05:00**): sustained freezing drizzle/light freezing rain, coldest temps, most efficient black-ice formation, and plows still contending with drifts and ruts.\n- Conditions_improve:\n  • Precipitation tapers around 5–6 AM; by **~9:00 AM** roads are better on primaries, visibility is 3–6+ miles, and wind chills moderate slightly, but secondary roads and lots remain slick.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- **Snow day probability for Rockford Public Schools, Tuesday Jan 20, 2026: 72%**\n- Confidence level: **high** (experts agree on key hazards; uncertainty mainly in administrative tolerance, not in the weather/roads themselves).\n- This is a situation where, given Michigan’s higher thresholds, a 2-hour delay is plausible; however, when weighing severe ice, rural routes, the warning context, and community expectation, a **full closure is more likely than not**.\n",
