  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT\n- Meteorology: Clear – no snow, no freezing rain, no active advisory on Monday; typical cold, breezy January day.\n- History: Days like this (dry, seasonable, post-advisory with no new precip) almost never generate closures in West Michigan; historical snow-day rates 1–3%.\n- Safety: Roads and travel conditions rated low risk (primary and secondary roads ~9/10, parking lots 8.5/10), with only localized refreeze issues possible. Explicit recommendation: normal operations, no snow day or delay.\n- News/Community: No closure announcements from Rockford or neighboring districts; no active winter alerts; no social or community buzz about a storm or snow day. Signals lean strongly toward a routine school day.\n\nAll four experts independently converge on the same bottom line: conditions are routine for Michigan and do not justify canceling school.\n\n2. ARE THERE ANY CONFLICTS?\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- Meteorologist mentions prior Sunday advisory, but clearly states it expires before Monday and that Monday itself is dry.\n- Safety flags only a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk *on leftover wet spots*, not a widespread ice event, and still concludes normal operations.\n- Historian’s seasonal adjustment (–0.05) actually lowers the snow-day probability vs. a generic national case, consistent with Michigan’s higher thresholds.\n- News intelligence finds zero neighboring closures or buzz about a storm.\n\nBecause all expert domains agree qualitatively (\"very low closure odds\"), there is no need for cross-check tools to resolve discrepancies.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW END TO 7:40 AM)\n- Meteorology shows 0% snow probability overnight and 0.0\" accumulation through Monday. The relevant winter weather (light snow / slick spots) is confined to Sunday, with advisory products expiring by early Sunday afternoon.\n- That gives road crews **well over 12 hours** – essentially from Sunday afternoon through early Monday morning – to plow, salt, and treat roads before a 7:40 AM start.\n- Since **no new precip** falls overnight, plow timing is actually generous: crews are in maintenance/cleanup mode, not active storm mode. This is ideal for safe operations.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Forecast: No freezing rain signal. Precipitation probability is 0% overnight and Monday.\n- Temps: 28–34°F with a rising trend; that allows for some refreeze of leftover wet spots overnight, especially on bridges and untreated side roads, but **no mechanism for new widespread glaze** (no moisture falling from the sky).\n- Safety classification: \"ice_formation_risk\": \"moderate\" specifically for residual moisture, not for a regional ice storm.\n- Visibility and winds: Good visibility (~6 miles), no blowing snow; winds breezy but not enough to cause drifting without new snow.\n\nConclusion: There may be **isolated slick patches**, but there is **no ice storm** or large-scale ice hazard. Under Michigan thresholds, that is far from snow-day territory.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford Public Schools: Website and calendar show a normal school day on Jan 12 with no weather alerts.\n- Forest Hills and other Kent County neighbors (Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): No posted closures or delays for Jan 12.\n- News/alerts: No active winter storm warnings or advisories for Monday in Rockford.\n- Community buzz: Social media sentiment is essentially \"no buzz\" – no emerging narrative that a snow day is likely.\n\nPer your weighting rules, neighboring closures would push probability up 15–20%; here we have **zero neighboring closures** and zero buzz, which strongly supports staying at the **low end** of any probability range.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey failure modes:\n- **Unexpected black ice outbreak**: If residual moisture from Sunday is more extensive than forecast and temperatures dip a bit lower, there could be more widespread black ice than expected, especially on rural routes. This would require real-time reports of numerous crashes or extremely slick bus routes pre-dawn. Current guidance and Michigan experience suggest this is unlikely but not impossible.\n- **Unforecast lake-effect band**: A surprise, narrow lake-effect snow band drifting into northern Kent County overnight could produce a quick 1–3\" burst. The meteorological analysis explicitly shows 0\" totals and no signal for this, so probability is very low.\n- **Last-minute administrative caution**: If, despite conditions being typical, district leadership chose to be extra cautious based on localized reports that don’t show up in current data. The lack of neighboring closures and lack of active alerts makes this scenario unlikely.\n\nGiven these, I assign a small but non-zero chance (~3%) that something unforecast and local causes disruption.\n\n7. NUMERICAL DECISION & WEIGHTING\nUsing the domain weightings you specified:\n- Meteorology (35%): Forecast says essentially **0–2%** chance of conditions warranting closure. I treat this as ~2% to allow for small forecast error.\n- Safety (25%): Explicitly recommends normal operations; low risk. Assign ~3% (mainly for possible black ice pockets).\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show roughly **1–3%** closure frequency. I take ~2%.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closures, no buzz, no alerts – this strongly supports the very low end. Assign ~2–3%.\n\nWeighted rough blend yields a baseline of about 2–3%. Because all four are tightly aligned and Michigan has higher closure thresholds, I stay near the low end: **3% snow day probability**.\n\nThis keeps the estimate decisive and outside the 40–60% \"mushy middle,\" aligning with both the data and Michigan’s typical tolerance for winter weather.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: For Rockford, MI on Monday, Jan 12, 2026, all signals point to a **normal school day** with routine winter precautions, not a snow day.",
