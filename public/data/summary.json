  "decision_rationale": "All expert inputs align on a benign Friday morning for Rockford: the meteorological forecast shows no snow/ice/rain at any hour and a warming temperature profile through the commute; winds are modest and visibility is good. The web verification did not find any credible source indicating extreme wind chills (≤ -20°F), so the extreme-cold automatic-closure rules do not apply. \n\nThe only meaningful disagreement was the safety write-up labeling ice formation risk as “moderate.” When clarified, this is not a widespread icing expectation—it's a localized, conditional black-ice concern (bridges, shaded curves, untreated subdivision streets, and low spots in parking lots) in the 5–8 AM window if there is leftover moisture/slush from prior days. With no new precipitation and temperatures rising after sunrise, that scenario typically leads to spot salting and minor caution messaging, not a district-wide closure in Michigan.\n\nSecond-order/community factors also point strongly toward being open: FOX17’s regional closings system currently shows no active closings/delays, Rockford’s site shows no closure/delay notice, and there’s no outage cluster in Kent County (county-level outages essentially zero). Net: a normal school day is the overwhelmingly likely outcome; a closure would require an unusual, non-forecast development (e.g., widespread unexpected flash-freeze/black-ice reports across bus routes, or a sudden localized facilities issue). Recommendation: OPEN with standard winter monitoring (or at most, consider a targeted transportation caution), not a closure or delay.",
