  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorology: Dry, seasonably cold, no snow or ice expected, no alerts, manageable winds. Explicit statement that risk of weather-related closure is very low.\n- History: Very similar past patterns (dry, around freezing, light prior icing) almost always had school; historical closure rates 1–5% with high confidence, and seasonal adjustment slightly lowers odds further.\n- Safety: Road and travel scores are high (8–9/10). Risk level marked \"low,\" with only localized refreeze/black-ice spots on untreated areas, and a clear recommendation for normal operations with routine caution.\n- News/Community: No Rockford or neighboring-district closure announcements, no strong social/media buzz about a likely snow day, and no indication of a regional closure domino.\nAll four point to low risk; there are no substantive conflicts.\n\n2. Conflicts or disagreements:\n- The only minor tension is that the safety assessment flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk for isolated untreated spots, while meteorology emphasizes no new precip and overall manageable conditions. These are compatible: meteorology is describing the weather; safety is warning about localized residual effects from Sunday. There is no disagreement about system-wide hazard being low and school being appropriate.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from event end to 7:40 AM):\n- Freezing rain/light mix occurred Sunday, not overnight. By the analysis time (late Sunday night), no additional precip is expected through Monday morning.\n- That implies well over 8–12+ hours of dry time before the 6–8 AM commute window and first bell (~7:40 AM), giving highway and local crews ample time to salt and address trouble spots.\n- Safety explicitly notes plows/salt will mostly be maintaining dry-to-damp pavement; worst road conditions are still rated favorable.\n\n4. Ice assessment:\n- No NEW freezing rain or snow is forecast overnight; temps hold near freezing but with dry conditions.\n- Residual patchy black ice is possible on bridges, overpasses, and untreated back roads due to prior light icing, but this is localized, not a widespread ice event.\n- Under the given thresholds, this does not qualify as an \"ice storm\" or major ice scenario that would drive probabilities into the 60–85%+ range.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intelligence reports no neighboring district closures and no clear closure domino effect (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD all appear to be in normal monitoring mode with no special actions announced).\n- There is thus no +15–20% probability bump from regional closures.\n\n6. Weighting by directive:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates routine winter weather with very low closure risk. This heavily anchors the probability near the bottom of the scale.\n- Safety (25%): Labels risk \"low\" and supports normal operations, adding more weight to a very low probability, while noting manageable, localized watch-outs.\n- History (20%): Historical snow day rate for similar patterns is 1–5%, with high confidence; this statistically supports a single-digit probability.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closure chatter, no early calls, no neighbor closures, and only uncertain sentiment. This confirms there is no hidden community-driven bump.\nGiven the Michigan thresholds (<4\" and no storm = 5–15%), and the fact that we have **0\"** expected and only minor residual ice, the structured evidence points slightly **below** even that standard 5–15% band.\n\n7. Final calibration and Brier-score mindset:\n- To avoid overestimating in a clearly quiet pattern, the probability is set at **3%**. This is within the historical analog range (1–5%) and consistent with the strong multi-expert consensus.\n- This keeps us decisive (not in the 40–60% ambiguity band) and aligned with Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter conditions.\n\nConclusion: Conditions do not meet typical Michigan closure criteria. A snow day on Monday, Jan 12, 2026 in Rockford is very unlikely; normal school operations are recommended with standard winter caution for isolated slick spots.",
