  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • All four experts agree there is no major storm affecting Rockford on the morning of Wed 12/03.\n  • Meteorologist: 0% snow, 0\" accumulation; dry, overcast, cold.\n  • Historian: This pattern (cold, gray, post-storm, no new precip) almost never produces closures; historical snow-day rates 1–5%.\n  • Safety analyst: Primary and secondary roads 8–9/10, low risk; only routine patchy black ice expected; explicitly says conditions do NOT justify a snow day or delay.\n  • News intel: No closures posted, no strong community expectation of a snow day, no Rockford-specific alerts.\n\n- APPARENT DISAGREEMENTS (and resolution):\n  • Meteorology vs. news intel wording: The meteorologist’s detailed forecast says 0% precip and 0\" snow; one news/headline blurb mentions “intermittent light snow and flurries with slick spots.” In West Michigan, models often show trace flurries with effectively 0 measurable accumulation, which is consistent with both: a technical 0\" forecast and a public headline emphasizing possible slick spots. With roads already plowed and temps cold and steady, this produces minor, not closure-level, impact. No other data suggest substantial snow.\n  • Safety vs. news intel on severity: Safety analysis characterizes travel impact as minimal, consistent with the more cautious yet non-alarmist tone of the news intel. Both say ‘watch for slick spots’ but ‘not a major storm’.\n\n  After cross-referencing, there is no meaningful conflict: all point to a routine cold, possibly slightly slick, early-December morning.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Last impactful advisories and warnings in nearby counties expire early Tuesday 12/02 at 07:00, more than 24 hours before the Wednesday 12/03 commute.\n- No new snow is forecast Tuesday day/night for Rockford, just cold and overcast.\n- That gives road crews effectively all day Tuesday and Tuesday night for cleanup before buses roll around ~7:00–7:40 AM Wednesday.\n- Hours from meaningful snow end (early Tue morning) to school start (Wed ~7:40 AM): roughly 24–26 hours.\n- With that much lead time and no new accumulation, West Michigan plow/salt operations can easily clear main routes and major bus corridors; any remaining issues are limited, localized slick patches.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Temperatures stay in the 20s°F overnight with a slow rise toward freezing later Wednesday.\n- Safety analyst flags ice risk as “moderate,” meaning:\n  • Existing melt/slush from the prior storm stays frozen.\n  • Spot black ice in shaded/untreated side streets, parking lots, and bridges is possible.\n- Crucially:\n  • There is no freezing rain, drizzle, or active icing event forecast.\n  • This is routine post-storm refreeze, not a glaze-ice storm.\n  • Emergency access concern is explicitly marked false.\n\n  In Michigan, this level of residual slickness is handled with standard caution and salting, not widespread closure.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior (secret-weapon weighting)\n- News intel explicitly states:\n  • No neighboring closures listed on FOX 17’s closings board for 12/03.\n  • No official closure announcements from key nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n  • Community/social chatter shows no strong consensus expecting a snow day.\n- Per the rules:\n  • 3+ neighboring districts closed ⇒ +15–20% bump. That condition is NOT met (0 districts closed so far).\n  • Community expecting closure ⇒ +10–15% bump. Also NOT met; sentiment is ‘uncertain but leaning open.’\n  • If community says “this is nothing,” lean lower. Here, the signal is closer to “nothing major, just be careful,” which supports staying at the low end.\n\n  Therefore, the news-intel weighting (20%) pulls the probability down toward the historical/meteorological baseline, with no positive bump.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Forecast supports extremely low closure probability because there is no active storm, no accumulation, and only moderate wind chills. Alone, this suggests ~2–5%.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Risk rated low; explicit recommendation: normal schedule, no closure/delay needed. This also points near 5%.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Direct analogs show 1–5% closure rates with high confidence. Slight seasonal adjustment downward. This anchors the lower bound.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight):\n  • No neighboring closures, no pre-emptive Rockford signal, mixed-but-quiet chatter. That supports ‘school in session,’ again ~5–10% at most.\n\n  Combining these: the blended, weighted estimate clusters tightly at the low end (roughly 3–8%). Selecting 6% reflects both the tiny chance of an unexpected overnight issue and the strong consensus that conditions are routine.\n\n6. Why avoid 40–60% and be decisive\n- There is no genuine expert conflict: all four lines of evidence agree on LOW risk.\n- Michigan-specific thresholds:\n  • <4\" new snow and no ice storm ⇒ 5–15% typical. Here we have effectively 0\" new snow and no glaze-ice event.\n  • No 8\"+ totals, no blizzard, no ice storm, no extreme cold.\n- That places this day right at the bottom of the Michigan scale. Using 6% is decisively in that lowest band.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes (low probability but non-zero) are:\n- A surprise, heavier-than-expected lake-effect band sets up overnight directly over Rockford, producing several inches (4–6\"+) right into the commute.\n- An unforecast light freezing drizzle event causes widespread black ice rather than isolated slick spots.\n- A major overnight incident (multi-car pileups, significant power outages, or a water/heat infrastructure problem at schools) leads to closure for reasons only partly related to the forecast.\n- New, last-minute decisions by multiple neighboring districts (3+ closing) based on localized back-road icing could create pressure for Rockford to follow, even if main-road data still look manageable.\n\nGiven the current expert consensus and tools, these remain low-probability, high-impact outliers, justifying a small but non-zero closure probability.",
