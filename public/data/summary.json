  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: No accumulating snow, temps near or above freezing, main issue is fog/mist and light drizzle.\n- Historian: Similar patterns (foggy, marginal temps, no snow) almost never lead to closures in this part of Michigan; closures usually require heavy snow, active ice, or extreme cold.\n- Safety analyst: Road risk is low; primary roads 8/10, secondaries and lots 7/10, driving conditions 8/10; only patchy refreeze risk, morning commute impact rated minimal.\n- News intelligence: District is on Winter Break; no active snow‑day process, no storm chatter, neighboring districts also on break.\n\nConsensus: Weather is marginal, not disruptive; normal Michigan‑winter conditions with mainly wet roads and fog. Operationally, school is not even in session on Dec 29.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There are no substantive conflicts:\n  - Meteorology and Safety both show low risk; both mention fog and near‑freezing spots but no major hazard.\n  - History aligns with a low closure rate (2–5%) in similar patterns.\n  - News intel doesn’t contradict weather; it simply adds that the date is within Winter Break, so any ‘closure’ is pre‑scheduled, not weather‑driven.\n\nGiven the lack of conflict, tool‑based clarification isn’t needed: forecast, risk, and operations all point in the same direction.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from worst conditions to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst‑conditions window from Safety: 2025‑12‑28T18:00 to 2025‑12‑29T06:00.\n- Typical high‑school start/first bus window: ~07:00–07:40.\n- That leaves roughly 1–1.5 hours between the end of the “worst conditions” and the start of the commute.\n- However, the worst‑conditions descriptor itself is modest: fog and some patchy refreeze with temps trending above freezing by commute time.\n- With road scores 7–8/10 and crews recommended only for spot treatment (bridges, cold spots), there is ample time for treatment where needed; there is no heavy snow to plow at all.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorologist: Prior Winter Weather Advisory for freezing rain was on Friday 12/26 only, with up to ~0.20\" ice then; advisory does NOT extend into Sunday night or Monday.\n- For the Sunday‑night–Monday period, temps hover near freezing but are rising, precip is light drizzle/mist, and no fresh ice accretion signal appears.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk is rated “moderate” but in the context of saturated ground and patchy refreeze; roads are still scored high (7–8/10).\n- Historian: Two intervening days plus above‑freezing Sunday mitigate prior ice; historically this setup seldom drives closures.\n\nConclusion: There may be isolated slick spots, but not a widespread active icing event. This does NOT meet the Michigan ‘ice changes everything’ threshold (which would push probabilities very high).\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel: Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD all show winter‑break calendars over this period.\n- No district is issuing storm‑day closure alerts for Dec 29 because they are already off.\n- There is therefore no basis for the ‘3+ neighboring districts closed due to weather’ +15–20% bump; the closures are calendar‑driven, not storm‑driven.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Upside error (probability set too low):\n  - Forecast could miss a late‑developing freezing‑rain/fog event overnight Sunday with more widespread glaze than modeled, causing notably worse roads by morning.\n  - A surprise advisory or warning could be issued Sunday night for significant ice; that would sharply raise the closure likelihood in a typical school day.\n  - However, even in that case for Dec 29, Rockford is already on break, so the ‘snow day’ call remains mostly academic.\n- Downside error (probability set too high):\n  - Roads could be fully dry/wet with minimal fog and essentially no slick spots; in that case the true operational weather‑closure probability would be close to 0%.\n\nGiven current data (no active advisory, warming trend, 0\" snow), the risk of a major forecast bust toward a disruptive event is low but non‑zero. This justifies a low, nonzero probability rather than 0%.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Shows no snow, no significant ice, modest winds, primary concern is fog with temps above freezing into commute. This strongly supports ‘schools would run normally’ from a pure weather perspective.\n- Safety (25%): Risk level explicitly ‘low,’ road and driving scores high, commute impact ‘minimal.’ This reinforces the meteorological read: no systemic hazard that would justify canceling.\n- History (20%): Similar setups show ≈2–5% closure rates, typically when school is actually in session. This grounds the decision statistically; no hidden high‑risk analogs appear.\n- News Intelligence (20% – secret weapon): Shows that Rockford and neighbors are already closed for Winter Break, and there is zero storm‑day chatter or special alerts for Dec 29. This eliminates the usual ‘neighbor influence’ bump and confirms that operationally no snow‑day choice is at stake.\n\nBlending these:\n- Pure weather/operational scenario for a normal school day would likely yield something like 5–10% (low‑end Michigan threshold for a minor, marginal event with fog and slight icing risk but no snow).\n- The fact that school is already off for Winter Break effectively means the actual *weather‑caused* closure probability is even closer to the floor, because there is no live decision.\n\n3. FINAL PROBABILITY & CONFIDENCE\nApplying Michigan thresholds and context:\n- Snow: 0\" → baseline 5–15% range defaults toward the low end.\n- No blizzard, no ongoing ice storm, no extreme cold.\n- No neighboring weather‑driven closures to add the +15–20% bump.\n- Calendar closure (Winter Break) further reduces the practical relevance of a snow‑day call.\n\nResult: I set the snow‑day probability at 5% with HIGH confidence.\n- This reflects a small residual chance that, if this were a regular school day and the forecast were slightly worse than expected (more ice than modeled), a closure could have been considered.\n- It stays out of the 40–60% ‘mushy middle,’ as required, and is aligned with historical and current‑risk evidence.\n\nFor Brier Score purposes against the Rockford stats students, a 5% call accurately captures a ‘very unlikely but not logically impossible’ outcome, minimizing squared error given all current signals.\n",
