  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all agree this is a high-impact travel day but **marginal by Michigan snow-day standards** on pure snow totals (≈2–2.5\").\n- All three agree the **worst conditions are in the 5–9 AM commute window**: active snow, falling temps, strong WNW–NW winds, and very poor visibility at times.\n- All agree there is **meaningful ice risk from refreeze and slush under new snow**, not from a classic ice storm.\n- All agree winds and blowing snow will make rural routes and open areas notably worse than urban cores.\n- News intel agrees that a winter storm is expected in the Dec 28–29 window and that travel could be hazardous.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Magnitude of operational school impact:\n  - Meteorology and history: frame this as a **“possible but not guaranteed” closure** with historical closure odds ~30–40% for similar patterns.\n  - Safety: leans more strongly toward **closure or at least a delay** due to severe commute risk.\n  - News intel: clearly states **there is no snow-day decision to make** for Dec 29 because Rockford is already on **Winter Break**.\n- Thus, disagreement is not about the storm’s severity, but about whether a **school-closure decision is even relevant**. News intel shows that, structurally, this is a non-school day.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to ~7:40 AM start)\n- Worst conditions window: 5:00–14:00 (safety timing analysis).\n- That means **snow is ongoing and near-peak at 7:40 AM**; it has *not* ended before the school-day start. Plows are working during, not after, the main burst.\n- There is essentially **0-hour gap** between snow end and typical high-school start; instead there is overlapping active snowfall, drifting, and visibility drops. From a pure-safety perspective, this strongly favors closure/delay if school were in session.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorology: no classic freezing-rain signal, but **rapid transition from >1\" rain to freezing temps and snow**; explicitly flags slick conditions as water on roads refreezes.\n- Safety: labels **ice formation risk as HIGH**, citing water-logged surfaces freezing under fresh snow and slush.\n- History: notes refreeze/transition setup with low-to-medium confidence as an additional hazard.\n- Conclusion: **yes, there is meaningful patchy ice/slush-over-ice risk**, but not a dedicated ice storm. It boosts hazard but does not trigger the 8+\"/major-ice-type closure criteria.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel: most neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) appear to be **on winter recess as well**, so:\n  - No regular school is scheduled.\n  - Therefore, **no classic ‘snow day’ announcements** are being made for Dec 29.\n- Under the competition rules, the ‘3+ neighboring districts closed’ adjustment is **not applicable** here because the closures are for planned break, not weather-triggered snow days.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Two distinct ways the prediction could miss:\n  1) If, contrary to the district calendar and official postings, Rockford **did** have classes on Dec 29 and then issued a weather-related snow day. In that case, the probability for a snow day should have been around **30–45%**, given:\n     - 2–2.5\" of snow (low-to-moderate by MI standards) → base 5–15%.\n     - Bad timing (snow + banding + visibility issues 5–9 AM) → +15–25%.\n     - High ice risk from refreeze → +10–15%.\n     - Strong winds and blowing snow on rural routes → +5–10%.\n     - Historical pattern context ~30–40% closure rate.\n  2) If the storm **overperforms** significantly: heavier bands park over Rockford and deliver 5–6\"+ by mid-morning with near-blizzard visibility. That would raise the true operational closure odds well above 50%. Current expert consensus, however, does *not* support that as the most likely outcome.\n\nGiven the strong, corroborated evidence from the official calendar and news intel, scenario (1) is structurally unlikely. Scenario (2) would raise hazard but still happen on a planned no-school day.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates a **high-impact travel day** with 2–2.5\" snow, strong winds, and poor visibility during commute. On weather alone this supports a moderate risk of closure/delay if school were in.\n- Safety (25% weight): Calls risk **severe** and explicitly suggests districts should seriously consider closure or at least delay. From a pure-operations view, this pushes toward a higher closure probability for an in-session day.\n- History (20% weight): Similar events produce **~30–40% full snow-day rates**, stronger odds of delays or messy-but-open days. This tempers the safety emphasis, reminding us that West Michigan often operates in conditions like these.\n- News intelligence (20% weight, but decisive context): Confirms **no school is scheduled Dec 29** due to Winter Break, and neighboring districts are also largely on break. This collapses the operational ‘snow day vs school’ question: the system’s impact is on **travel and general activities, not on school closure decisions**.\n\nBecause the *existence* of a school day is binary and known from official sources, that contextual fact from news intel dominates the final decision: even if hazard is high, there is **no snow day to call**.\n\nCALCULATED PROBABILITY\n- Hypothetical operational closure probability (if school were in session): ~35–45% based on meteorology, safety, and history.\n- Actual snow-day probability for Rockford Public Schools on Dec 29, 2025, given the calendar: reduced to the small residual chance that **the district unexpectedly changes its calendar or labels the day as a weather closure anyway**, which is extremely unlikely.\n- Assigning 5% reflects:\n  - Very low, but not truly zero, chance of an unscheduled policy decision or misinterpretation.\n  - Strong confidence in the published calendar and the lack of any closure communication.\n\nThis keeps the Brier score optimized: predicting a high probability of a snow day when school is officially on break would be a large, unjustified error. The correct framing is that conditions are **worthy of a hypothetical snow day**, but in practice they occur on **a planned no-school day**.",
