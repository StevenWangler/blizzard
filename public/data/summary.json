    "Low snowfall total (~1.3\") and modest peak rates (around 0.4\"/hr) — typically manageable for West Michigan operations",
    "Patchy glaze/black-ice risk from Thu evening light freezing rain/freezing drizzle potential, followed by subfreezing temps overnight (high-impact even if accretion is just a trace)",
    "Commute-window hazards are more about visibility + thin ice than depth: mist/low ceilings with visibility down to ~1 mile and snow increasing around ~8 AM (during/just after arrivals)",
    "No confirmed domino effect yet: regional closings pages and neighboring-district sites showed no active closings/delays in the latest pull",
    "Power grid conditions look normal (low outages systemwide); no evidence of outage-driven closure"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, news, and power: the base case is a nuisance/light snow day for Rockford with the main risk coming from a thin, patchy glaze and reduced visibility rather than accumulation. Meteorology and history both point to low closure likelihood (roughly mid-teens) given only ~1.3\" forecast and winds/cold well above extreme-closure thresholds. Safety and infrastructure add a meaningful operational concern: even modest freezing rain/freezing drizzle (likely trace to <0.01\" generally, with pockets 0.01–0.05\" on bridges/untreated residential) can create outsized crash/bus-stop risk during 6:45–9:15 AM, especially if a fresh coating of snow begins around 8 AM and hides slick spots. However, there is no confirmed widespread closure domino effect yet, and power outages are not a driver. Net: I keep full-closure probability in the low-but-nontrivial range at 20% (higher than a simple ‘1-inch snow’ day because ice/visibility timing is the real pathway). Operationally, a 2-hour delay is more plausible than a full snow day if early road checks find multi-location slickness.",
