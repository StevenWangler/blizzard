  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology: Explicitly states 0\" snow, no meaningful precip, normal visibility, and essentially zero risk of a closure based on weather.\n- Safety: Labels risk level as low, with roads 9–9.5/10 and only routine winter caution needed; recommends normal operations.\n- History: Finds comparable past patterns with a 0% historical snow day rate and confirms this setup is not a trigger pattern for closures.\n- News/Intel: Shows no closure announcements, no neighboring district decisions, no media hype about a winter storm, and no social-media buzz about a snow day.\nAll four are aligned: there is no snow/ice event, no infrastructure stress, and no community signal. There are no meaningful conflicts to resolve.\n\n2. Plow timing math\nSnowfall is forecast at 0\" with no measurable precip. That means there is nothing for plows to clear specifically for this date. Any residual snow/ice from prior days would have been handled already, and road scores near 9/10 support that. Time from snow end to 7:40 AM is effectively infinite because there is no active event—so plow timing is a non-issue for this decision.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Temp profile: Around 30°F pre-dawn, rising to mid-30s°F with a steady trend.\n- Precip: No new moisture modeled overnight or into the commute.\n- Winds: 15–20 mph helps dry surfaces rather than promote freezing drizzle.\nThe safety analyst rates ice risk as low and notes no need for preemptive salting beyond routine practice. There is no freezing rain signal and no dense freezing fog signal; any isolated slick spot risk is typical for December and not closure-level. So there is no high-impact ice threat.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and regional signals\nNews intelligence explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and broader Kent County TV closings pages and found:\n- 0 pre-announced closures or delays for December 17.\n- Kent ISD has only generic closure guidelines posted, not an active closure.\nThere is no regional domino effect. Per the weighting rules, 3+ neighboring district closures would add 15–20 percentage points; here we have zero, which supports keeping the probability at the floor.\n\n5. Weighting the four experts\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear-cut no-storm, no-snow, no-ice forecast with above-dangerous wind chills. This strongly supports a near-zero probability.\n- Safety (25%): High road/parking scores, low ice risk, and explicit recommendation for normal operations. Reinforces a near-zero probability.\n- History (20%): Analog days with this pattern have a 0% closure rate, and typical Rockford triggers (6–10\"+ snow, ice storms, or extreme wind chills) are absent. This pushes probability toward the absolute minimum.\n- News/Intel (20%): No official or unofficial buzz, no neighboring closures, and a regional forecast talking about rain with the next system, not snow. This confirms there is no hidden community or decision-maker signal that would bump odds up.\nAll four, weighted, converge very tightly toward 0%, with no offsetting upward pressure.\n\n6. Michigan threshold framework\n- Snow amount: 0\" vs. thresholds that start at <4\" = only 5–15% chance. We are below even that category because there is literally no event.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard conditions, no strong wind plus snow combo, and no extreme cold.\n- Operationally, this day looks indistinguishable from a typical mid-December school day.\nGiven that, the statistically sound Brier-score-optimized choice is to predict a very low but nonzero probability (2%) rather than 0%, to allow for unforeseen operational or non-weather issues.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure mode would be an unforecast, localized hazard emerging after this analysis, such as:\n- An unexpected freezing drizzle or dense freezing fog event that creates widespread black ice in the 3–6 AM window.\n- A last-minute non-weather-related closure (e.g., infrastructure issue) that coincidentally occurs on this date.\nHowever, none of the current data from any expert suggests these are likely. With dry conditions and temperatures trending above freezing, plus no emerging chatter or advisories, the probability of such surprises appears very small.\n\nPutting this together, a 2% snow day probability with very high confidence best reflects the combined expert evidence and maintains a strong expected Brier score against the stats students.",
