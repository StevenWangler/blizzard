    "No meaningful accumulating snow forecast for Monday (snow-driven closure unlikely)",

    "Neighboring-district “domino” closure signals for Monday are not present (weak closure momentum)",

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: (a) Snow accumulation on Monday is not the issue; (b) the main hazards are patchy ice from a brief midnight freezing-precip window and possible low visibility near dawn; (c) primary roads should be generally passable by bus time with ongoing maintenance; (d) no wind-chill ≤ -20°F signal is confirmed; (e) no widespread power outage signal.\n2) Disagreements: The main conflict is whether the hourly “0-mile visibility” is real widespread dense fog versus an over-aggressive model/encoding artifact. Meteorology clarified it’s more likely pockets/intermittent drops (0.5–2 mi common, near-zero in spots) rather than hours of true 0.0 mi everywhere.\n3) Plow timing math: Icing/precip ends ~12:00–01:00. That leaves ~5.5 hours to 6:30 AM bus roll and ~7.7 hours to 7:40 AM start—enough for treatment on trunklines/arterials, but not enough to guarantee clean neighborhood streets given subfreezing temps.\n4) Ice: Yes—non-zero risk (thin glaze/black ice). This is the biggest ‘surprise’ pathway.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel did not find confirmed Monday closures/delays in nearby districts; several show normal Monday calendars. No domino effect.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages low (~155 customers) with Kent extremely low; not a driver.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier cannot confirm with fresh sources, but nothing supports ≤ -20°F; WeatherAPI bottoms around -5.5°F.\n8) What would make me wrong: If (a) freezing fog becomes widespread with near-zero vis during 6:30–8:00 AND (b) spot checks find widespread untreated glaze on secondary roads/turnarounds, Rockford could pivot to a delay or even closure.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verification (5%).\n- Meteorology supports low closure odds but highlights patchy ice + possible low vis.\n- Safety rates the morning as high-risk operationally, but explicitly expects OPEN with a meaningful chance of DELAY rather than closure.\n- History anchors closures for this pattern at ~8–15% and notes fog-alone rarely closes.\n- News intel shows no neighboring-closure momentum.\n- Infrastructure expects ‘generally passable’ mains by 6:30 with localized slick spots.\n- Power is stable.\n- Web verifier finds no extreme wind chill trigger and cannot confirm a Dense Fog Advisory.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds: with ~0\" snow and only patchy ice/fog risk, the closure probability stays low. I set 16% (slightly above the debate average 15%) to reflect the non-trivial compounded risk of patchy black ice + possible low visibility during the bus window, but without the “domino” closure signals or verified widespread dense fog, a full closure is still unlikely.",
