    "Temperatures stay below freezing, causing slick spots and some refreeze, but **conditions are stable, not rapidly deteriorating**, by Monday morning.",
    "Historical analogs for similar weekend-timed 6–10\" storms in this area show **roughly 10–25% closure rates**, with most districts open on time.",
    "Winds and drifting are present but **below blizzard criteria**; impacts are mainly on rural/secondary roads, not system-wide gridlock."

  "decision_rationale": "Given Michigan-specific tolerances, this setup points strongly toward **school being open on time Monday, Dec 1**.\n\nMeteorology: The core of the storm—1\"+/hr rates, poorest visibility—occurs **Saturday evening through Sunday morning**. By late Sunday morning, accumulating snow largely ends, and Sunday afternoon is a cleanup window with cold, breezy, but improving conditions. A late Sunday night burst may add 1–3\" but is short-lived and not part of a prolonged 6\"+ overnight hit.\n\nOperations: Plows and salt trucks have **~18–24 hours** between the end of the main snow and Monday bus runs. In Kent County, that is usually enough to get **primary and most secondary roads to acceptable winter condition**, with remaining issues on subdivisions and rural stretches. There is **no significant ice or mixed-precip signal** and **no extreme cold** forcing a closure on temperature alone.\n\nHistory: Analog patterns with weekend 6–10\" storms and a full Sunday cleanup window show **low but non-zero** Monday closure rates—generally in the 0.10–0.25 range. Your own expert components converged near 15–25% for a full snow day and ~60–70% for a normal day.\n\nSafety: The safety profile is **moderate**, not severe: slick spots, some drifting, and high ice-formation risk in parking lots and side streets, but **manageable with standard mitigation**. There is not a compelling safety case for a preemptive full closure given local norms.\n\nBalancing these, a **22% snow day probability** is appropriately low but still acknowledges the main upside risk: if the late Sunday night band slows or strengthens and lingers into the 3–6 AM window, some routes could be under active moderate/heavy snow with plows behind, forcing a last-minute decision. That scenario is plausible but not the base case.",
