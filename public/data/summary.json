    "Snow is light (~1.2\") and occurs Sunday daytime, ending ~2 PM—leaving ~16.5 hours for plowing/treatment before Monday bus routes",
    "Primary Monday AM hazard is patchy refreeze/black ice on bridges, shaded rural stretches, and polished intersections (more delay-prone than closure-prone)",
    "No extreme cold signal (no credible source shows ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours)",
    "No confirmed neighboring district closure domino effect; closings pages and district sites show no Feb 23 weather posts",
    "Power outage risk is low: Consumers Energy system-wide outages are very low (127) with crews available, no cluster evidence"

  "decision_rationale": "All experts broadly agree this is a ‘Michigan-manageable’ event: about ~1.2 inches of snow on Sunday late morning/early afternoon with modest winds, then a long cleanup window before Monday morning. That strongly argues against a full closure for Monday 2/23. The only meaningful pathway to a closure is if Sunday slush/compaction plus overnight temps in the upper 20s produce widespread slickness on secondary/rural bus routes (or if unmodeled freezing drizzle/light precip occurs pre-dawn Monday—something we cannot confirm from the provided hourly block, which stops Sunday night). News intelligence shows no Rockford or neighboring-district closure signals and no active closings page indicators, which keeps probability low and helps avoid the common ‘overpredict’ mistake in Michigan. Infrastructure expectations support passable main/bus-route connectors by 6:30 AM, with patchy black-ice risk mainly on lower-priority segments—more consistent with a possible delay than a closure. Power grid conditions do not currently support a closure scenario.",
