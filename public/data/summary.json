  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. AGREEMENTS ACROSS ALL FOUR EXPERTS\n- Meteorologist: Main winter event is Wednesday; Thursday is cold, dry, overcast, with 0% chance of new snow or freezing rain and 0.0\" new accumulation.\n- Historian: Very similar post‑storm, dry, mid‑20s°F days almost never produce closures here (1–3% historical snow‑day rates), given West Michigan’s high tolerance.\n- Safety analyst: Worst road conditions end by early Wednesday evening (around 18:00–20:00). With no new precip, plows and salt have a long, clean window to restore roads; morning and afternoon commute impacts on Thursday are rated minimal; risk level low.\n- News intel: As of ~9:15 PM Wednesday, there are NO posted closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts for Thursday. Closing lists are not populated for Thu yet; official guidance and calendars show a normal day. Community chatter is cautious but not strongly expecting a shutdown.\n=> Shared conclusion: Thursday is a routine cold winter school day with only residual slick spots, not an active winter storm or ice event.\n\n2. POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT OR TENSION\n- There is essentially no direct conflict. The only nuance is:\n  • News intel and regional outlooks mention a \"medium\" risk of closures for WEDNESDAY north of I‑96, with some concern about lingering impacts into Thursday.\n  • Meteorology and safety, however, show that by Thursday there is no ongoing precip, no heavy lake‑effect banding in the commute window, and only typical refreeze risks.\n  • Community sentiment is labeled \"uncertain\"—some people speculate about possible delays north of I‑96, others expect normal operations.\n- Importantly, no expert suggests substantial new overnight accumulation, no one indicates a strong ice-glaze threat Thursday morning, and no expert points to visibility or wind concerns that reach closure levels.\n=> Any residual uncertainty is about how well roads get cleaned, not about the weather itself; the safety analyst explicitly judges that cleanup time and conditions are adequate.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (FROM SAFETY ANALYST)\n- Significant mixed precip ends around 18:00–20:00 on Wednesday.\n- Forecast from ~20:00 Wed through at least 08:00 Thu is dry and overcast with temps in the low–mid 20s°F.\n- Road crews’ heavy work on main routes is expected between ~01:00–05:00 Thu, with additional treatment of secondary roads and lots continuing up to the commute.\n- Morning bus window: ~06:00–08:00; first bell around 07:40.\n- Time from meaningful precip end (18:00–20:00 Wed) to start of bus window (~06:00 Thu) is ~10–12 hours, and ~13–15 hours to first bell.\n=> This is ample by Michigan standards for plows/salt to get main roads into good condition and secondary roads into typical winter shape. There is no timing-based justification for a delay or closure.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Temps are below freezing all night (~23–25°F) so refreeze occurs on untreated surfaces.\n- However, there is NO new incoming freezing rain or drizzle and no liquid precip expected overnight.\n- Safety analyst flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\": localized slick patches on side streets, driveways, parking lots, and elevated surfaces, but not widespread black ice.\n- Meteorology shows minimal visibility issues (clouds, patchy fog/mist at worst) and light winds (5–11 mph), so there is no blowing-snow or blizzard-related hazard.\n=> This is normal refreeze, not an ice storm. It does NOT rise to the \"ice changes everything\" threshold used in Michigan closure decisions.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel confirms: As of about 9:15 PM Wed, there are NO confirmed closures or pre‑announced delays for Thursday for Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, or GRPS.\n- Major TV/online closings lists are not yet populated for Thursday for these districts.\n- Past cases where “nearly every district in Kent County” closed on a Thursday involved ongoing snow/lake-effect and poor roads that persisted through the early morning; those decisions were made around 5 AM day‑of and publicized then—not the night before.\n=> With zero neighboring Thursday closures currently in place, the NEWS INTEL adjustment is neutral: there is no +15–20% bump from a closure domino.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Upside error (schools DO close despite this low probability) could happen if:\n  • An unforecast band of lake-effect or freezing drizzle develops overnight and drops several inches of fresh snow or a light glaze right in the 3–7 AM window.\n  • Plow or salting operations underperform unexpectedly (equipment failures, staffing issues), leaving rural or hilly bus routes significantly worse than modeled.\n  • A last‑minute chain reaction of closures occurs across Kent County based on more pessimistic on‑the‑ground reports than are available in the data here.\n- Downside error (schools stay open while conditions are worse than expected) is less relevant for the “snow day probability” metric but would correspond to more icy/slick local conditions than models and safety analysis suggest.\nGiven the consistent dry forecast, fully below‑freezing temps (no melt‑refreeze cycles with liquid), and the long plow window, these failure scenarios are possible but low-likelihood; they justify a probability above 0%, but still in the single digits.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS\nFollowing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly supports a near‑zero closure probability: no active precip, no heavy winds, no alerts. This pulls the base estimate toward ~1–3%.\n- Safety (25%): Rates road risk low with minimal commute impact and ample cleanup time. This is consistent with a normal day, pushing probability into the ~2–5% range.\n- History (20%): Historical closure rates for nearly identical patterns are 1–3%. This anchors the forecast firmly in the low single digits.\n- News intelligence (20%): No neighboring closures, no official hints from districts, and only mixed, non‑decisive social chatter. This neither adds the +15–20% bump (no domino, no strong expectation of closure) nor pushes probability dramatically lower, but it does confirm that community expectations lean more toward a normal day.\n\nNUMERICAL DECISION\n- Starting point from meteorology and history: ~2–3%.\n- Safety analysis (good plow timing, low risk) supports slightly above historical minimum but still low: ~3–4%.\n- News intel shows no closure domino and no strong \"everyone expects a snow day\" sentiment: no upward adjustment; small upward nod for unresolved, but low, early‑morning uncertainty.\n- Final synthesized value: 5% probability of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools on Thursday, 2025-12-11.\n\nThis stays within the Michigan threshold guidance (<4\" new snow; no ice storm) which suggests a 5–15% range; given the especially quiet Thursday forecast and strong infrastructure, 5% is justified at the very bottom of that band.\n\nConfidence is rated HIGH because all four expert domains align on a low‑impact, post‑storm, dry scenario with abundant cleanup time and no strong contrary signals from neighboring districts or community chatter.",
