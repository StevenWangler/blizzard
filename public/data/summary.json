  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Meteorologist: Calls it a cold but quiet day with effectively 0% chance of snow or ice and no storm signal; explicitly states there is no meteorological basis for a snow day.\n- Historian: Finds very similar past patterns (cold, cloudy, dry mid‑December days) have near-zero closure rates (0–1%) and high confidence that this is a “typical winter school day,” not a snow‑day setup.\n- Safety Analyst: Rates primary and secondary roads ~9/10 and walking conditions 8/10, with low overall risk and only isolated slick spots; explicitly recommends normal school operations and says a snow day or delay is not warranted.\n- News/Community Intel: Shows no closure announcements for Rockford or neighboring Kent County districts, no TV closing‑list domino effect, and community sentiment that reflects routine winter caution rather than expecting a snow day.\nAll four experts independently point to the same conclusion: conditions are routine winter cold with some residual slickness, but no active storm and no systemic disruption.\nThere are no real conflicts: everyone converges on an extremely low closure probability.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- No new snow is forecast overnight or in the morning (total snowfall: 0\"; snow probability 0% throughout).\n- Worst conditions window from the safety analyst (00:00–07:00) refers to existing frozen surfaces, not ongoing accumulation.\n- Because nothing new is falling, plow/salt crews only need to manage residual slick spots. With 7+ hours between midnight and a typical first-bell around 7:40 AM, there is ample time for normal overnight/early‑morning maintenance.\n- Effective “hours from snow end to 7:40 AM” is many hours (the prior event already ended before midnight), which is extremely favorable.\nSo plow timing is not a limiting factor; it strongly favors having school.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Temperatures stay below freezing (mid‑20s°F) with no new precipitation, so there is some risk of refreeze on residual moisture.\n- Safety analyst flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\", but road, parking lot, and walking scores are still very high (8–9/10), and they recommend only standard salting/sanding of known trouble spots.\n- Meteorologist notes no freezing rain or drizzle and no active precip at commute times.\nThis is normal Michigan winter slickness, not an ice storm. It does not approach the “ice changes everything” threshold in the district guidelines.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel confirms: no advance closures or delays for Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD as of late evening Dec 11.\n- Major local TV closing lists (FOX 17, WZZM context) show no pre‑emptive cluster of shutdowns.\n- Community/social sentiment is described as uncertain but not excited about a major storm; regional messaging is about continued cold and some slick spots, not a storm day.\nPer the decision rules, we only boost probability substantially if multiple neighboring districts are closing or if community clearly expects closure; neither is true. Instead, signals align with staying open.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (explicit Brier-focused synthesis)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): 0–1% closure implied. I treat this as ~1% upper bound because there is always some residual risk that a surprise band or freezing drizzle forms, even if not forecast.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, high road scores, explicit recommendation for normal operations → effectively ~1–2% closure probability driven mainly by the possibility of an unexpected overnight change.\n- History (20%): Near-zero closure rate for this pattern (~0–1%). I adopt 1% as a conservative historical baseline to avoid underestimating rare decisions.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closure announcements, no neighboring domino effect, and no strong snow‑day buzz. That strongly supports the low end, around ~1–3% to account for last‑minute decisions.\nCombining these with their weights, and recognizing that all four independently converge very near zero, the blended, rounded estimate is about 1%.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds\n- New snow: 0\" → well below even the lowest snow‑trigger threshold (<4\" = only 5–15% in more marginal setups, and that assumes snow is actually falling).\n- No ice storm, no freezing rain, and no blizzard conditions.\n- Wind chills remain far above extreme‑cold closure thresholds (roughly -15°F), so no cold‑day trigger.\n- No 3+ neighboring districts pre‑closed, so no +15–20% domino adjustment.\nRelative to the provided Michigan thresholds, this day is markedly safer and calmer than even the lowest‑end closure situations.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 1% prediction could fail:\n- An unforecast late‑night/early‑morning event: surprise freezing drizzle, dense freezing fog, or a narrow lake‑effect band that quickly ices or covers roads before plows can respond.\n- A sudden deterioration in observations (e.g., rapidly increasing crash reports or major black ice on key bus routes) that prompts a cautionary early‑morning call not evident in the current model‑based forecast.\n- Non‑weather factors (e.g., a power outage or infrastructure issue) arising overnight; current intel shows no outages, but they can develop.\nThose are genuinely low‑probability surprise scenarios; they justify setting probability at 1% instead of absolute 0%, which also protects Brier score accuracy.\n\nPutting it all together, with unanimous low‑risk assessments, clear plow timing, no storm, no alerts, and no neighboring closures, the most accurate and decisive forecast is that Rockford Public Schools will almost certainly be open on Friday, 2025‑12‑12. A snow day is highly unlikely.",
