    "High refreeze/black-ice risk on secondary roads/bridges from Thursday’s mixed precip + temps plunging; salt effectiveness reduced at very low temps",
    "No credible, consistent signal of freezing fog/near-zero visibility during the 6–9 AM commute (stronger fog signal appears late evening); low-vis values look partly artifact",

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree Friday is a cold-driven day with near-zero new snow, with the meaningful risks being wind-chill exposure and leftover/refreeze slick spots (especially secondary roads). Also agreement that a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: (a) How much to weight the near-zero visibility/freezing-fog signal—meteorology indicates it is not consistent in the 6–9 AM window and may be artifact; (b) how bad secondary-road icing could be—safety upgraded black-ice likelihood to high given refreeze + reduced salt effectiveness.\n3) Plow timing math: Conservative precip-impact end ~20:00 Thu → ~11h40m of treatment time to 07:40 Fri. That is typically enough for priority routes, but not a guarantee for neighborhoods/bridges in extreme cold.\n4) Ice: No new freezing rain expected Friday, but refreeze/black ice risk is meaningful (this is the main travel hazard).\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Friday closures/delays posted yet in captured checks (so no +15–20% bump).\n6) What would make me wrong: If wind chills verify closer to -20 to -25°F for multiple hours at pickup time (district threshold trigger), or if black ice is widespread on secondary roads, or if fog/visibility collapses near dawn despite the point forecast.\n\nWeighting (per system): Meteorology 30% (dry, cold; commute wind chills around -12 to -15°F; fog not strongly supported at 6–9 AM), Safety 20% (high refreeze/black ice on secondary roads; main roads likely OK), History 15% (dry-but-brutal cold usually yields delays/partial impacts more than full closures), News 15% (no Friday closure announcements found yet; earlier-week closures provide only a modest nudge). Remaining 20% (infrastructure/power grid folded into safety/news): no confirmed outage spike.\n\nMichigan threshold application: This is not a snowfall-total day (0\" forecast), so baseline would be low (≈5–15%). I raise it into the mid-20s because (1) refreeze/black ice risk after prior mixed precip in arctic air, and (2) cold-exposure operational pressure for bus riders. I do NOT push higher because (a) wind chills in the specific 6–9 AM point forecast are closer to -12 to -15°F (below the -15 to -20°F “many close” band), (b) no verified fog during commute, and (c) no neighboring-district Friday closure confirmations yet.\n\nNet: 26% for a full snow day/closure (with a higher likelihood of a 2-hour delay than a full closure).",
