  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree this is NOT a snowfall/plowing event; it’s an ice/black-ice morning with some visibility risk. Also agree wind chills are not extreme enough (no ≤ -20°F trigger). Most see DELAY as the modal outcome.\n2) Disagreement: Severity/coverage of icing and visibility. Safety frames ‘high’ morning risk; meteorology/history emphasize very small QPF and short window, making full closure less likely. Web verification flags the ‘0 mi visibility’ as uncorroborated for the commute window.\n3) Plow/treatment timing math: There’s essentially nothing to plow Wed AM; it’s treatment timing. Updated safety + infrastructure: trunklines/arterials likely improved by ~6:00–6:30, but county/local streets may remain inconsistent through ~7:30 and improve more meaningfully ~8:30–10:00. That timing aligns with a delay being effective.\n4) Ice: Yes—this is the primary driver. Even tiny freezing drizzle at 5–6 AM on very cold pavement can create a thin glaze, especially on bridges, hills, shaded secondary roads.\n5) Neighboring districts: Confirmed strong signal—Forest Hills shows a ‘One Hour Delay’ for Wed 1/28. That pushes toward delay rather than full closure; no confirmed multi-district closure cascade for Wed.\n6) Power: Power Grid Analyst verified extremely low systemwide outages (~2 customers affected) and only moderate localized risk. No outage-based override.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier found no ≤ -20°F in any accessible source; WeatherAPI also stays far above that. Cold contributes to persistence of ice, but not a standalone closure trigger.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) freezing rain is heavier/more continuous than forecast and produces widespread glazing on neighborhood roads before 6:30, (b) dense freezing fog/visibility near-zero persists into 6–8 AM (not supported by cross-check), (c) an unexpected multi-district closure cascade occurs overnight, or (d) localized power outages hit key school buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive):\n- Meteorology (25%): thin freezing rain risk but tiny QPF → leans away from full closure.\n- Safety (25%): bus-window black ice risk 5–8 AM → pulls probability upward.\n- History (15%): thin glaze usually produces delays more than closures → moderates.\n- News Intel (15%): neighboring Forest Hills delay (not closure) + no Rockford Wed post → moderates down.\n- Infrastructure (10%): local streets lag until ~8:30+ → supports delay, modest closure risk.\n- Power (5%): no outage signal → no upward adjustment.\n- Web verifier (5%): no ≤ -20°F; questions 0-mi visibility during commute → moderates.\n\nFinal call: A full closure is plausible but not the most likely outcome; the most likely operational response is a delay. Therefore, I set a 38% probability of a full snow day (closure) for Rockford on Wed 1/28, with moderate confidence due to uncertainty in actual icing coverage on secondary roads during 5–7 AM.",
