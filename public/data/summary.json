  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert Agreement vs. Conflict\n- All four domains agree: there is no significant wintry hazard for the Thursday morning commute.\n  • Meteorologist: 0\" snow, all rain, temps above freezing for bus and start times; explicitly calls this a \"fully travelable\" rainy day.\n  • Historian: Analog patterns (rainy, near‑freezing January days) show 1–3% closure rates; strongly favors school in session.\n  • Safety analyst: Morning commute impact labeled \"minimal\"; road and driving scores 7–8/10 with recommendation to proceed with normal start times.\n  • News/community intel: No RPS closure hints, no neighboring district closures, no strong social/media buzz about dangerous Thursday morning roads.\n- Minor tension: Safety lists ice risk as \"moderate,\" but meteorology and history show no actual freezing rain or snow and roads above freezing. This is treated as a low‑probability, localized black‑ice consideration, not a systemic closure driver.\n\n2. Plow Timing Math\n- Total modeled snowfall: 0\"; no plowing required.\n- Morning bus window: roughly 6–8 AM with temps around 31–33°F, dry or just damp, no active wintry precip.\n- Since there is no snow event ending just before school, the usual \"hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\" calculation is moot. Roads are simply wet/damp, not being cleared of snow.\n\n3. Ice Assessment\n- Meteorology: Precipitation type is rain; no freezing rain modeled and no accumulating snow. Pavement temps above freezing through the key commute hours.\n- Safety: Flags a general \"moderate\" ice formation risk due to near‑freezing temps, but without precip this mainly means isolated slick spots on bridges/untreated side roads, not a district‑wide hazard.\n- Historian: Notes that closure‑level events historically require significant snow, clear ice storms, or extreme cold; none apply here.\n- Conclusion: There is no widespread ice or ice storm signal. At worst, normal winter caution for a few slick patches.\n\n4. Neighboring Districts & Community Signals\n- News intel explicitly finds no Jan 8 closure announcements for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD.\n- Rockford Public Schools website shows Jan 8 as a normal school day with no weather alerts or prep messaging.\n- No event cancellations or strong social-media sentiment indicating dangerous Thursday‑morning conditions.\n- Under the competition rules, absence of neighboring closures means no +15–20% upward adjustment; community is effectively neutral to slightly \"this is routine\" for West Michigan.\n\n5. Weighting the Experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Strong signal for a standard wet, above‑freezing school day; pushes probability toward the floor (≈1–5%).\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as safe with only moderate afternoon rain impacts; supports low closure odds (≈5–10%), but slightly higher than pure meteorology due to generic slick‑spot caution.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates around 1–3%; reinforces a very low baseline probability.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No closure chatter or neighboring domino effect; pulls probability down toward the historical/meteorological base.\n\n6. Numerical Decision & Brier Strategy\n- Michigan thresholds: With 0\" snow and no ice storm, the event is below even the \"<4\" snow\" category that starts around 5–15%. This justifies going below that range.\n- Combining:\n  • Meteorology suggests ~1–2%.\n  • History suggests ~1–3%.\n  • Safety (accounting for generic slick‑spot risk) might allow ~5–7%.\n  • News intel leans firmly to normal operations (~1–3%).\n- Weighted average lands near 3%. To minimize Brier score vs. a very likely \"school open\" outcome, it is rational to be decisive and keep the probability very low rather than hedging in the 10–20% band.\n\n7. What Would Make This Wrong?\n- An unmodeled overnight shift to freezing rain or a quick burst of snow that creates widespread glazing before 5–7 AM.\n- A last‑minute Arctic push dropping temps several degrees below forecast, causing widespread black ice on wet roads.\n- Sudden, early‑morning power outages or flooding not currently indicated.\n- A surprise regional decision wave (multiple neighboring districts closing for reasons not reflected in current data).\nGiven the current analyses, these are low‑likelihood edge cases, which justify a nonzero but very small probability.\n\nFinal call: This is an ordinary wet, gray January school day in West Michigan. School is overwhelmingly likely to be in session with normal start times.",
