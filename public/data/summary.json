  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- All four streams agree the *overnight through early-morning commute (before ~8 AM)* is dry but cold, with roads largely clear for plows and traffic.\n- They agree on **low snow totals (~1.1\")**, with the main hazard being a **late-morning to early-afternoon transition to freezing rain (11 AM–1 PM)** creating slick conditions.\n- They concur this is *not* a high-end snowstorm (no blizzard conditions, no extreme cold) but does pose **moderate travel risk** once freezing rain develops.\n- News intel and historian both emphasize that Rockford and neighboring districts are **already on Winter Break**; closures on Dec. 26 are calendar-based, not weather-based.\n\n2. Disagreements / nuances:\n- Meteorologist: explicitly notes a **low probability of a traditional morning snow day closure**; sees the primary risk as late-morning/afternoon travel and activities.\n- Safety analyst: labels risk as **moderate** overall, highlighting **significant afternoon impact** but only **moderate morning commute impact**.\n- Historian: similar mixed-precip patterns show **~25–30% snow-day rates**, but that’s for days when school is actually in session and when icing occasionally reaches higher impact.\n- News intel: clarifies that **no actual snow-day decision exists** because school is closed for break; that effectively dominates the operational outcome.\n\nThere is no substantive conflict about the *weather*: the differences are in how impactful the event would be **if school were in session**. In reality, the NEWS intelligence makes clear the key operational fact: **no classes that day**.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Snow and mixed precip begin around **09:00**.\n- Standard high-school start/reference time: **~07:40 AM**.\n- End of meaningful freezing-rain threat: **~13:00**.\n- From the **end of snow/ice to 07:40 AM**, for this specific calendar day, is not relevant because the event is *after* the typical start time. If school *were* in session, plow crews would actually have a **clean, dry overnight window (midnight–7 AM)** to fully prep roads before any precip starts.\n\n4. Ice presence:\n- Yes, **freezing rain is explicitly forecast** 11:00–13:00 with temps 30–32°F and a high risk of glazing on untreated surfaces.\n- This *would* be a serious concern for midday travel and could justify early dismissals or activity cancellations if school were in session.\n- However, it does **not** coincide with the early-morning bus window, which is the main driver of a classic snow day.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel reports that **Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and other Kent ISD districts** are also on **winter break**; any closures are **calendar-driven**.\n- There are **no weather-based closure chains** or domino effects to factor in; thus, no +15–20% bump from neighboring districts is appropriate.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- The only realistic way to be wrong on a *snow day* probability here would be if the **calendar information were incorrect** (i.e., school unexpectedly in session) or if a district opted to brand some weather-related action (like cancelling a camp or optional program) as a full ‘closure.’\n- All provided official sources, however, consistently show **Winter Break Dec. 22–Jan. 2** with no classes Dec. 26. The probability of a true instructional-day snow day is therefore effectively tied to a calendar reversal, which is extremely unlikely.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates **low morning hazard, higher late-morning/afternoon hazard**, and only ~1.1\" snow with mixed freezing rain. On weather alone, this supports a **low–moderate** snow-day risk if school were open, mainly because of the ice.\n- Safety (25%): Rates overall risk as **moderate**, but emphasizes that **core 6–8 AM commute is mainly dry**, with worst travel 09:00–13:00. That again suggests **not a classic morning closure**, more of a midday concern.\n- History (20%): Analog events show ~25–30% closure rates **when school is in session** and when icing sometimes lines up with commute windows. Given the later timing here and Michigan’s higher thresholds, that historical signal is **on the low side** of closure probability.\n- News Intelligence (20% – ‘secret weapon’): Provides the decisive context: **Rockford Public Schools is closed for Winter Break; no instructional day exists to cancel.** Neighboring districts are also on break. This essentially collapses the actual, realized snow-day probability for Dec. 26, 2025, toward 0–5%, regardless of the marginal meteorological case for closures on a normal school day.\n\nSYNTHESIS INTO A PROBABILITY\n- If this were a normal school day:\n  - 1.1\" of snow + mid/late-morning freezing rain with high ice risk would put the **base closure probability** roughly in the **20–30%** range given Michigan thresholds (low snow amount, but presence of ice and tricky midday timing).\n- However, because **school is already out for Winter Break**, the operational question “Will there be a snow day?” translates to: “Will the district declare a weather-related school closure on a day where no school is scheduled?” Historically and practically, that is almost never done.\n\nGiven that:\n- Calendar certainty is high (official website, multiple posts, regional practice),\n- Neighboring districts are also on break (no chain-reaction effect),\n- No indication of an emergency-level storm (blizzard/ice storm with infrastructure failure),\n\nI assign a **5% snow day probability**. This is not 0% only to allow for highly unusual administrative labeling (e.g., if the district bizarrely issued a ‘closure’ notice despite break), but such a scenario is extremely unlikely.\n\nConfidence is **high** because the key determinant (the calendar) is clear and corroborated, and all weather experts broadly agree on timing and magnitude of the event.\n\nIn summary: Weather may cause **hazardous midday travel**, but it will almost certainly **not** result in a formal snow day for Rockford, since school is already closed for Winter Break.",
