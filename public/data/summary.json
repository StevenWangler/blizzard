  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: No additional accumulating snow, no freezing drizzle, 0.00\" QPF overnight; cold, dry, overcast; winds light; visibility generally good.\n- Historian: Pattern is a classic cold, calm, post-storm day. Historically only ~3–8% of such days are closures; Michigan usually holds school in these conditions.\n- Safety analyst: Mixed precip ends by early Wednesday evening; from ~6 PM Wed to 7:40 AM Thu there is a 13–14 hour plow/salt window. Primary roads ~9/10, secondary ~8/10, parking lots ~8/10; risk level low and supports normal start.\n- News intel (cross-checked with meteorology/safety): No new storm for Thursday morning; concerns are residual slick/ice in spots, not an active weather event.\n\nCommon agreement: Weather for Thursday morning is cold but routine, with no fresh snow/ice. Any hazards are leftover slick spots, not ongoing storm conditions.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorology (35%), History (20%), and Safety (25%) all independently point to a VERY LOW operational need for closure based on weather conditions alone.\n- News Intelligence (20%) reports that Rockford Public Schools and multiple neighboring districts are ALREADY officially listed as CLOSED for Thursday, Dec 11, on FOX 17’s authenticated closings list.\n- This is not a disagreement about the weather itself; it is a divergence between what the models/history say the district *should* do and what districts have in fact *decided to do*.\n\nGiven the problem framing (predict actual closure outcome for Rockford on Dec 11), the News Intelligence must be given decisive weight once it shows confirmed official closures.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Mixed wintry precip tapers off around 4–6 PM Wed (Dec 10).\n- Conditions are dry from roughly 6:00 PM Wed through the Thursday morning commute.\n- School start ~7:40 AM Thu.\n- That gives about 13–14 hours of plow and salt time.\n- Safety analyst confirms this window allows:\n  • Primary routes to be fully plowed and treated.\n  • Secondary routes and bus corridors to be in good shape, with only residual compacted snow/ice on some lower-volume or rural roads.\n- Conclusion: The plow math strongly favors safe-enough operations under normal Michigan standards.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- There is no NEW freezing rain or drizzle overnight.\n- Residual ice risk:\n  • Moderate for untreated spots: bridges, overpasses, shaded rural curves, and low-drainage parking-lot corners.\n  • However, this is characterized as localized and manageable, not a widespread black-ice event.\n- Cross-check confirmation: No strong signal for an advisory-level ice situation or sudden, unexpected black ice beyond what is already in the safety assessment.\n\nConclusion: There is some residual ice, but not the kind of broad, active icing that typically drives a blanket closure in Michigan by itself.\n\n(5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel tool (secret weapon) finds:\n  • Rockford Public Schools – CLOSED for Thu, Dec 11, on FOX 17’s official closings list.\n  • Neighboring/nearby districts also CLOSED: Cedar Springs, Comstock Park, Kenowa Hills, Northview, Greenville, plus several additional rural districts (Tri County, Central Montcalm, Lakeview, etc.).\n- This is far beyond the 3+ neighboring districts threshold and constitutes a strong, regional north-of-Grand-Rapids closure cluster.\n- Per your rules: 3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20% probability bump, and in this case the target district itself is explicitly listed as closed.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Two directions:\n  • Overestimate risk (predict closure, but they open): That would require FOX 17’s authenticated closings list to be erroneous or prematurely updated, and for Rockford and multiple neighboring districts to reverse their closure decisions and open on time despite already notifying media.\n  • Underestimate risk (predict open, but they close): That already appears to have happened at the decision level—media closings show closure. Predicting “open” would almost certainly be wrong.\n- Given the reliability of major TV closings systems (they reflect direct district submissions), the chance that all these closure entries are reversed is extremely low.\n\n2. WEIGHTING THE EXPERTS\n\nUsing your prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Says conditions do NOT require a closure; suggests probability in the 5–10% range.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good plow window, minimal commute impact; again 5–10% based on conditions.\n- History (20%): Similar post-storm days give ~3–8% closure historically.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Overwhelming, direct evidence that Rockford and many neighbors have already chosen to close.\n\nIf I only used the first three (conditions-based) experts, I would land around 5–10%, well within your Michigan thresholds for a dry, cold day after a storm.\n\nHowever, your instructions explicitly state that News Intelligence is the secret weapon and that neighboring closures should shift probabilities up heavily. Here, the News Intel does not merely hint at possible closure—it reports Rockford itself as officially closed.\n\nGiven that our task is to predict the *actual* outcome (for Brier score against students), the reality of a confirmed closure must override the low theoretical need for one. Therefore:\n- I retain the meteorology/safety/history insight only as context.\n- I give decisive weight to the News Intel once it shows confirmed closures.\n\n3. AVOIDING 40–60% AND APPLYING THRESHOLDS\n\nYour Michigan thresholds:\n- <4\" snow = 5–15% (routine)\n- 4–6\" = 15–35%\n- 6–8\" with good timing = 35–50%\n- 8+ inches OR ice = 60–85%\n- Blizzard/ice storm = 80–95%\n- 3+ neighboring districts closed = +15–20% adjustment\n\nPurely by weather, this would be a <4\" post-storm scenario on a dry day: default 5–15%.\nBut the *actual* closure decisions and 3+ neighboring closed condition push us far beyond the theoretical thresholds. Since Rockford is explicitly listed as closed, the probability of a snow day, defined as “Will school be closed?”, is effectively near certain.\n\nTo remain honest and Brier-score oriented, I choose:\n- 99% snow day probability, very high confidence.\n- 100% would imply zero chance of error (e.g., a late-night correction, technical mistake on the list). 99% allows for that tiny tail risk while still reflecting the overwhelming evidence.\n\n4. SUMMARY OF WHY THE PREDICTION IS SO HIGH DESPITE LOW WEATHER RISK\n- Meteorology, Safety, and History say: This is a day where, under strictly weather/operations criteria, Rockford *could* be open.\n- News Intelligence says: Rockford and a cluster of neighbors have *already decided* otherwise and submitted official closures.\n- In a forecast competition where the target variable is the actual closure outcome, the district’s communicated decision is the ground truth. Once confirmed via a reliable channel (FOX 17 closings list), it dominates the probability estimate.\n\nThus, even though the physical conditions do not demand closure, your model’s goal is to predict what *will happen*, not what *should happen*. All credible signals indicate that Rockford will indeed have a snow day on Thursday, Dec 11, 2025.\n",
