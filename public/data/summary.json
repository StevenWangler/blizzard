    "Primary hazard is patchy ice (light freezing rain/drizzle 01:00–05:00) on bridges/overpasses, intersections, and untreated neighborhood/bus-route roads; snow accumulation is not the driver",
    "Road clearing outlook: main routes likely serviceable by ~06:00–07:30, but local/subdivision streets remain inconsistent hard-pack/ice—this favors a DELAY more than a full closure",
    "Visibility conflict resolved: web cross-check does NOT support the API’s ‘0 mile’ visibility; dense fog at 06:00–08:00 looks unlikely based on available web sources",
    "No confirmed wind chill ≤ -20°F (closure threshold not met); feels-like likely in the ~-11°F to +7°F range depending on source/variant",
    "Neighboring-district ‘domino’ pressure exists due to Wednesday’s regional closures, but there are no confirmed Thursday closure postings yet on major closings lists or district sites",
    "Power outages not currently a primary driver (no meaningful local outages visible); however, regional grid-stress/conservation messaging slightly increases operational risk if conditions deteriorate"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: (a) snow totals are not the issue; (b) a pre-dawn icing window is the main risk; (c) primary roads improve by the morning commute but secondary/local roads stay variable; (d) wind chills are cold but not at the near-automatic closure threshold.\n2) Disagreements: the only major conflict was the API’s near-zero visibility values vs other sources. Web verification did not corroborate dense fog at 06:00–08:00, suggesting the ‘0 mi’ entries are likely invalid/missing rather than true whiteout fog.\n3) Plow timing math: freezing precip risk ~01:00–05:00; effective ‘melt’ is limited due to very cold pavement, so the key is abrasives/traction. By 06:00–07:30, trunklines/primaries should be moving, while local/subdivision streets remain inconsistent—this profile usually produces DELAYS more than district-wide closures.\n4) Ice? Yes—this is the core concern. Even light glaze can create bus-route failures on hills/bridges.\n5) Neighboring districts: prior-day closures were widespread, but there is no confirmed Thursday closure wave yet (closings list and district sites show no postings at check time). So I do not apply the +15–20% ‘3+ neighboring districts closed’ bump for Thursday.\n6) Power outages: not currently present at meaningful scale; grid stress is elevated with conservation messaging, but that’s not a direct closure trigger absent outages at schools.\n7) Wind chill verification: no multi-source confirmation of ≤ -20°F.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) icing is more widespread than forecast (trace becomes a real glaze) especially on secondary roads, (b) an unexpected dense freezing fog forms right at bus time, (c) an early ‘domino’ closure wave starts overnight and Rockford follows.\n\nWeighting the experts per directive: Meteorology (25%) and Safety (25%) dominate because this is an ice/commute-timing event; both point to ‘delay more likely than closure.’ History (15%) supports that trace icing events more often yield delays. News intel (15%) adds upward pressure from recent closure momentum, but lacks confirmed Thursday closure signals tonight. Infrastructure (10%) indicates main roads likely serviceable by ~06:00–07:30 but locals remain problematic. Power (5%) is a minor add (grid stress, but no outages). Web verifier (5%) reduces closure odds by downgrading the dense-fog/visibility-zero concern.\n\nNet: I’m setting a 30% chance of a FULL closure (snow day). The most likely operational outcome is a 2-hour delay rather than closure, driven by patchy black ice on bus routes.",
