  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist, historian, safety analyst, and news intel all agree that:\n  • A significant winter event will impact Rockford early Monday, Dec. 29, with rain changing to snow overnight.\n  • Temperatures fall below freezing before and during the morning commute window, creating flash‑freeze/ice risk on previously wet surfaces.\n  • Winds are strong (25–30 mph sustained, gusts up to ~45–55 mph) with blowing and drifting snow and periods of very low visibility.\n  • Travel during the early‑morning through late‑morning period will be hazardous, especially on rural and open roads.\n  • Nearby counties to the west/north are under Winter Storm Warnings; Kent County (including Rockford) is under a Winter Weather Advisory.\n  • Crucially: Rockford Public Schools (and most neighboring districts) are on Winter Break on Dec. 29, so there is no normal school day to cancel.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist: Places the *weather‑based* closure probability around 70–80% if school were in session (weighing timing, wind, whiteouts heavily).\n- Historian: Historical analogs give about a 50–60% closure rate for similar events when school is in session.\n- Safety analyst: Rates risk level as \"severe\" for travel, strongly implying that a closure or long delay would be advisable *if* school were scheduled.\n- News intel: Emphasizes that there is NO SCHOOL due to Winter Break, and that neighboring districts are also on break—no live closure choices are being made.\n\nThe only real \"disagreement\" is conceptual: the first three implicitly assume a standard school day is possible; the news intel clarifies that operationally there is no snow‑day decision because the calendar already has no classes.\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions: ~2:00 AM – 1:00 PM.\n- Around Rockford, snow and heavy blowing/drifting are ongoing through and beyond the 7:40 AM start‑time proxy.\n- That means there are effectively 0 hours of post‑storm cleanup before the normal start of school; plows would be working *during* peak conditions (strong winds, near‑zero visibility, active snowfall/blowing).\n- In a normal session this would support a relatively high closure probability; but here it mainly informs travel advice rather than a snow‑day call.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Yes: high ice/flash‑freeze risk.\n  • Wet roads from prior rain.\n  • Temperatures dropping into upper 20s by the commute.\n  • Safety analyst explicitly flags ice formation risk as \"high\" and notes flash‑ice potential on untreated surfaces.\n- This would substantially elevate closure odds in a normal school scenario.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel shows:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: Official calendar says \"NO SCHOOL – Winter Break\" Dec. 22, 2025 – Jan. 2, 2026, including Monday, Dec. 29.\n  • Cedar Springs: Also on Winter Break through Jan. 2.\n  • Regional calendars for Kent ISD districts: Broadly indicate Winter Break during this week; no active snow‑day announcements, just scheduled no‑school days.\n- Therefore, there are effectively many neighboring districts \"closed,\" but for scheduled break, not as weather‑driven snow days. The Michigan thresholds rule about \"+15–20% for 3+ neighboring districts closed\" does **not** apply because the closures are not weather decisions.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Overestimation risk (predicting a snow day that doesn’t exist):\n  • Ignoring the calendar and treating this as a standard session day would inflate the snow‑day probability toward 60–80%, which would be logically incorrect given that no snow‑day decision is being made.\n- Underestimation risk (missing a de facto closure):\n  • The district could, in theory, cancel scheduled events (practices, camps, extracurriculars) because of weather. But the question is about a **school snow day**, which is already overridden by Winter Break.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND WEIGHTING\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Weather alone strongly supports at least a delay and likely full closure if school were in session: 2–4\" of snow, flash freeze, whiteouts, Winter Weather Advisory during commute hours, and 40–55 mph gusts. This suggests a notional 70–80% *conditional* closure probability on a normal school day.\n- Safety (25%): Safety assessment marks road and walking conditions as severe, with high ice risk and poor visibility from before the morning commute into midday. That aligns with a strong recommendation to avoid normal school operations during that period.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs give roughly a 50–60% closure rate for similar patterns when school is in session, slightly moderating the meteorologist’s 70–80% estimate but still clearly in the closure‑is‑plausible range.\n- News Intelligence (20%): This is decisive for the **actual** question. It confirms there is no regular school scheduled (Winter Break) for Rockford and neighbors on Dec. 29, so the operational snow‑day probability collapses regardless of how likely a closure would be if school were in session.\n\nGiven the competition context (Brier score, being decisive), the correct interpretation is:\n- Conditional on school being in session: the probability of a closure would be high, roughly 65–75%.\n- Unconditional, given that school is *not* in session: the probability of an official snow day is effectively near 0. I assign 5% to cover edge‑case interpretations (e.g., the district branding cancellations of break‑week programs as a \"snow day\"), but for the standard K‑12 calendar definition this is essentially no snow day.\n\nTherefore, the final snow day probability is set to **5% with high confidence**, driven primarily by calendar status from News Intelligence, with meteorology, safety, and historical data reinterpreted as travel‑risk context rather than closure odds.",
