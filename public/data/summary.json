  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree this is NOT a heavy-snowfall event; the main risk is timing (pre-dawn through bus hours) plus slick roads and some blowing snow. All also agree a DELAY is more likely than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The biggest conflict was WeatherAPI implying near-whiteout/very low visibility and advisory wording suggesting -15°F to -20°F wind chills. Web verification (fresh NWS update) does NOT support <= -20°F wind chills for Rockford Tuesday morning and does NOT confirm near-whiteout during 5–9 AM; safety analyst also downgraded the ‘severe’ label if vis stays ~0.5–1+ mile.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow impacts ease ~09:00–10:00, which is AFTER a typical 06:30 bus rollout and AFTER a ~07:40 start. That means buses would run during the worst window; local streets likely won’t be consistently bus-ready until later morning.\n4) Ice: No freezing rain signal; the ice concern is mainly packed snow/black-ice potential from very cold temps and untreated spots.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Tue 1/27 closures/delays found yet on key nearby district sites; no social buzz.\n6) Power: Material change—Consumers Energy shows ~33,990 outages statewide. Rockford/Kent-specific impact is unconfirmed; this adds downside risk but cannot justify a high closure probability without local confirmation.\n7) Wind chill verification: Multiple web sources confirm wind chills around -2 to -4°F in the key 5–9 AM window—NOT the <= -20°F trigger.\n8) What would make this wrong: If a narrow band overperforms and produces widespread near-zero visibility or fast drifted-over roads on bus routes, or if outages expand into Rockford/Kent County overnight, the closure odds jump quickly.\n\nWeighted decision (per directive): Meteorology (25%) and Web verification (5%) pull probability DOWN because totals are light and extreme wind chill/whiteout are not confirmed. Safety (20%) and Infrastructure (10%) pull probability UP due to bus-route timing vs ongoing snow and local-street variability. News (15%) is neutral-to-down (no confirmed neighbor calls). Power (10%) pulls UP modestly due to the new statewide outage spike but with local uncertainty. History (15%) supports delay-preferred outcomes for this pattern. Net: a low-to-moderate closure chance, but meaningfully elevated above a routine 0.5–1\" snow day because conditions are peaking during transport hours and local roads are the weak link.\n\nRecommendation focus: A 1–2 hour delay is the most likely operational choice; full closure is plausible but not the base case without verified whiteout, major icing, or local outages.",
