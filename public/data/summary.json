  "decision_rationale": "1) EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: Only about 0.5–0.6\" of snow on Tuesday, all snow, no ice, with the main burst 9 AM–early afternoon. Morning temps in mid‑20s°F rising toward freezing.\n- History: Events like this (light snow, marginal cold, winds 15–25 mph, no ice, modest visibility drops) almost never cause full snow days in West Michigan; historical closure rates 2–10% depending on exact analog.\n- Safety: Critical 6–8 AM window is cold, windy, and mainly dry; worst conditions are 9 AM–1 PM. Roads are passable but slick, particularly later in the morning and midday. No strong safety case for full closure; recommends normal start with caution and re‑evaluation.\n- News/Community: Heavy snow has recently impacted the region and roads are currently described as snow‑covered and slippery, but as of the timestamp there are no pre‑announced closures for Rockford or neighboring districts, and community sentiment is ‘uncertain’ rather than confidently expecting a snow day.\nAll four agree: this is a nuisance/light-to-moderate snow situation for Tuesday with higher impacts late morning, not a classic heavy-overnight or ice-based closure setup.\n\n2) EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS / TENSIONS\n- The main tension is between: (a) the forecast for only ~0.6\" new snow on Tuesday with no ice and (b) news intel noting that several inches of heavy snow have already fallen in the broader region and that plows are still working on snow‑covered roads.\n- Meteorology and history strongly downplay closure odds based on Tuesday-specific totals and timing; safety and news acknowledge that existing snow cover plus ongoing cleanup will make travel slow and slippery.\nHowever, no expert suggests conditions rise to typical Michigan closure triggers (8\"+ snow, ice, or severe wind chills) during the school day in Rockford.\n\n3) PLOW TIMING MATH (END OF SNOW TO START OF DAY)\n- Importantly, there is essentially NO new accumulating snow overnight before school: snow probability overnight is 0%, with snow only appearing on the forecast around 9 AM.\n- That means from midnight to the 7:40 AM start, plows are dealing with:\n  * existing snow from the prior event (already ongoing), and\n  * dry, very cold conditions suitable for clearing.\n- Rockford/Kent County crews are experienced with sub‑2\" and several‑inch events and have multiple hours before buses roll to treat and clear primary routes. There is no late-ending heavy band just before school to compress plow time.\n- By 7:40 AM, main roads are likely to be plowed and treated, with secondary/rural routes still slick but usable at reduced speeds—typical for West Michigan operating days.\n\n4) ICE RISK\n- Meteorological analysis: All snow, temps largely 24–32°F, no freezing rain signal.\n- Safety notes ‘moderate’ ice formation risk, but that is from cold surfaces, residual packed snow, and thin glaze in spots, not a distinct ice storm.\n- Historically and operationally, Michigan districts reserve closures for more severe icing scenarios. Here, conditions are better described as cold, snowy/slushy, and intermittently slick rather than a dedicated ice event.\nConclusion: There is some patchy slipperiness, but not enough to reclassify this as an ice-driven closure day.\n\n5) NEIGHBORING DISTRICT STATUS\n- News intel: As of the latest check, no full‑day closures have been announced for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD member districts for Dec 9.\n- TV closing lists show no preemptive Rockford or regional shutdown.\n- Community sentiment is ‘watchful but uncertain,’ not ‘everyone expects to be off.’\nAccording to your rules:\n- 3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20%: NOT MET.\n- Community broadly expecting closure → +10–15%: NOT MET; sentiment is mixed.\n- Community saying ‘this is nothing’ → lean lower: also not fully met; there is concern, but not a strong closure drumbeat.\nNet community adjustment: roughly neutral—perhaps a slight upward nudge from the fact that roads are currently snow‑covered and plows are still at work, but not enough to override low-snow, no‑ice, post‑commute timing.\n\n6) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nThe main ways to be wrong (i.e., an unexpected closure occurs) are:\n- Forecast bust that pulls accumulating snow several hours earlier into the 4–8 AM window with higher rates than 0.3\"/hr, creating poor visibility and untreated accumulation right at bus time.\n- Underestimation of Monday’s storm leftovers—if rural and hilly routes north/east of Rockford remain poorly cleared by early Tuesday, the superintendent might call a closure or delay based on bus access, independent of Tuesday’s modest new snow.\n- A late-evening regional decision where multiple neighboring districts pivot to closing after updated observations show more widespread drifting or heavier totals.\nNone of those are strongly indicated in the current data, but they explain the residual (non-zero) chance.\n\n7) WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your percentages)\n- Meteorology (35%): Points to ~0.6\" new snow, no overnight accumulation, no ice, and post‑commute onset. This strongly favors school being open. I weight this heavily in driving the probability down toward ~10–15%.\n- Safety (25%): Labels risk as ‘moderate,’ emphasizes a manageable but slower morning commute with more intense conditions mid‑day. Safety explicitly says there’s no strong indication for a full snow day and recommends a normal start, which supports the meteorological view but adds that mid‑day operations need caution.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show 2–10% closure rates, with a seasonal probability adjustment downward (‑0.15) given local norms and experience. This anchors the prediction in the low-probability band.\n- News Intelligence (20% – ‘secret weapon’): Shows that roads are currently snow‑covered and slick, which could argue for a small upward adjustment from pure forecast stats; but crucially, there are NO neighboring district closures and NO strong community expectation of a snow day. Under your rules, I do NOT apply the +15–20% or +10–15% boosts. Instead, I nudge the historically implied ~10% up to about ~15–18% to reflect real-world messiness and current road challenges.\n\n8) FINAL QUANTITATIVE PLACEMENT\nMichigan thresholds you gave:\n- <4\" snow → 5–15% typical.\nWe are well below 1\" forecast on Tuesday with no ice and the worst weather after the morning start. Historically that’s around 5–10% closure odds. Current messy roads and some community concern justify slight upward adjustment but not a different regime.\nBlending:\n- Historical analogs: ~5–10%\n- Meteorology & safety: strongly suggest open; I center near ~10–15%.\n- News intel: adds a few percentage points, but no closure domino or strong expectation.\nI land at **18%**: low, but not negligible. That keeps us outside the 40–60% ‘mushy middle’ and aligned with your Michigan thresholds while accounting for current road issues.\n\nConclusion: The best forecast, balancing all four expert perspectives and real-world signals, is that Rockford Public Schools **will most likely have a regular school day on Tuesday, Dec 9, 2025**, with some slower travel and midday operational challenges, not a full snow day.",
