    "No ice/freezing drizzle signal in the Thu AM commute window; primary risk is patchy slick/compacted snow and black ice on bridges/untreated roads",
    "Winds (10–16 mph) can cause some drifting/blowing, but not a high-end whiteout setup for Rockford",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays for Thu 1/22 as of the latest checks; community buzz minimal",
    "Main “could-be-wrong” factor: a narrow lake-effect band/snow squall shifting inland during 06:00–08:00 creating a sudden visibility drop and rapid road deterioration"

  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1) Agreement across experts: All four sources converge on a low-accumulation event for Rockford with the most impactful snow overnight (roughly 2–5 AM) and little/no additional precip shown during the 6–8 AM commute window. All note cold/wind chills near 0°F and some risk of slick spots; none present a strong Kent County advisory/major storm signal for Thu AM.\n2) Disagreement: News intel emphasizes this week’s *regional* travel hazards (I-196 pileup earlier in the week; broader arctic messaging), which raises general caution but does not directly conflict with the point forecast showing minimal Thu AM snow. Meteorology/safety/history align that this is more “normal winter day” than closure.\n3) Plow timing math: Worst snow ends ~05:00 and first bell/bus window ~07:40 → ~2 hours 40 minutes (~2.7 hours) of cleanup/treatment time. This strongly favors open, with possible slow neighborhoods.\n4) Any ice?: No freezing rain/freezing drizzle indicated for 05:00–09:00; ice risk is “moderate” mainly from compaction/polishing/black ice on untreated surfaces (bridges, rural roads), not a glaze-ice event.\n5) Neighboring districts: Latest checks found no verified closure/delay announcements for Rockford-area districts (Rockford/Forest Hills/Northview/Sparta/Cedar Springs/Lowell/Kentwood) for Thu 1/22; closings aggregators also did not show postings.\n6) What would make this wrong?: A mesoscale lake-effect band/snow squall crossing Rockford during ~06:00–08:00 causing a sudden visibility crash and rapid slickening of secondary roads; or an under-forecast overnight burst that leaves more than ~3\" plus drifting.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): 1.1\" total, snow ends before commute; no Thu headline → strongly lowers closure odds.\n- Safety (25%): moderate patchy slickness; enough plow buffer; points to “open or possibly delay,” not closure.\n- History (20%): similar patterns yield low snow-day rates (~8–18%), more delays than closures; steady subfreezing reduces freeze-thaw ice risk.\n- News Intel (20%): no confirmed neighboring closures; regional hazard context increases vigilance but not enough to override low totals/timing.\n\nMichigan thresholds: <4\" typically 5–15%. With no verified neighboring closures (no +15–20% bump) and no ice storm signal, I place this near the upper end of that band due to patchy black ice + recent regional travel issues: 12% chance of a full snow day (closure).",
