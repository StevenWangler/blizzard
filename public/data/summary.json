  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology: Clear and dry for Rockford on Monday 1/12, with 0\" new snow, no freezing rain, and no visibility issues. Wind chills are in the teens, not extreme.\n- History: Past patterns with nearly identical conditions (dry, near 30°F, prior light event) yield a 1–5% closure rate, with high confidence that schools usually stay open.\n- Safety: Road and travel risk is rated low (primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10). Morning and afternoon commute impacts are both labeled minimal.\n- News/Intel: Rockford and neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no closures or delays posted for Monday. Coverage emphasizes a weekend system ending Sunday, not a Monday storm.\nAll four experts agree that: (a) there is no active storm Monday, (b) conditions are typical for Michigan winter, and (c) there is no strong signal toward a closure. There are no significant conflicts among the experts.\n\n2. Plow timing math\nSunday’s light snow/freezing rain and advisory conditions taper by Sunday midday/afternoon. That gives roughly 12–18+ hours before the Monday 7:40 AM start for plows and salt to work, with no new overnight precipitation. With temps near 28–30°F and traffic on main routes, that window is ample for Kent County crews to return primary and most secondary roads to safe condition. The safety analyst’s scores (8–9/10) are consistent with this.\n\n3. Ice risk\nMeteorology explicitly indicates no new freezing rain or drizzle overnight and zero precipitation for the commute. Safety flags only a moderate risk of refreeze on untreated spots (bridges, shaded bends, low-volume side roads). This is localized black-ice potential, not a district-wide ice event. Historically, Rockford and similar Michigan districts stay open under these conditions, using driver cautions rather than cancellation.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\nNews intelligence confirms: no early closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, no Monday-focused advisories for Kent County, and no widespread power/road crises. Community sentiment is described as uncertain but not alarmed, and coverage is past-tense about the weekend storm. Per the weighting rules, we would only increase the closure probability by 15–20% if multiple neighboring districts were already closed; here, they are not, so no upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\n- Meteorology (35%): Dominant signal is a dry, cold, normal winter day with no new snow or ice and decent visibility. This strongly pulls the probability toward the very low end (~1–3%).\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, high road scores, and minimal commute impact further support a very low closure probability, consistent with meteorology.\n- History (20%): Analog days show approximately 1–5% closure rates. This narrows the plausible band to the low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closure chatter, no posted closures, and no Monday advisory for Rockford all confirm that local decision-makers are not preparing for a snow day.\nBalancing these, a 3% probability best matches the integrated signal: above absolute zero to acknowledge small residual-ice uncertainty, but squarely in the 5–15% Michigan guideline band for <4\" snow—here with 0\" new snow and only leftover slick spots.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 3% estimate could fail are:\n- An unforeseen localized icing issue overnight (e.g., freezing fog or a mis-forecast patch of light freezing drizzle) creating much more black ice than expected on key bus routes.\n- A last-minute, non-meteorological factor (significant bus mechanical issues, staffing shortages, or unrelated emergencies) causing closure despite benign weather.\nGiven current data and typical Rockford practice, both are low-probability scenarios.\n\nOverall conclusion: With no new snow, no ice storm, and only isolated refreeze risk after a modest Sunday event, Rockford Public Schools are overwhelmingly likely to operate on a normal schedule Monday, January 12, 2026.",
