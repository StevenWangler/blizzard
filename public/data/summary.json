    "No confirmed domino-effect closures from neighboring districts and no RPS announcement yet (as of latest checks)",

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, safety, and history, the core agreement is that Monday is a *brief freezing-rain glaze risk* morning—not a snowstorm. The highest-risk window (roughly 5–7 AM) overlaps school dispatch and bus routes, and at mid-teen temperatures salt can be slower to work on low-volume roads/parking lots, so a delay is plausibly the most common operational response.\n\nWhere there was a conflict: the web verification initially flagged ≤ -20°F wind chill from a Weather.com page. A cross-check indicates that extreme “Feels Like -26°F” appears to be a wrong-location/wrong-date context (including a Rockford, IL page), and additional hourly sources align much closer to the provided WeatherAPI feed (single digits above 0°F wind chills, not extreme). With the extreme-cold trigger removed, there is no automatic-closure driver.\n\nNews intelligence also matters here: there are no confirmed neighboring district closures yet and no Rockford Public Schools closure/delay post visible in the latest pulls—typical for an overnight icing event where districts often decide very early based on road checks. Power grid conditions are calm (statewide outages extremely low), so there’s no infrastructure forcing function to close.\n\nNet: A *district-wide* closure is plausible but not the base case; it would require freezing rain to be steadier/longer than forecast and to create widespread slickness on secondary roads and school lots during the 6–7:30 AM window. The more likely outcome is a 1–2 hour delay or opening with caution if pretreatment is effective and the freezing rain ends on time. To optimize Brier score in a Michigan context (high tolerance for winter, low tolerance for ice), the most defensible full-closure probability remains in the low-to-mid 20s.",
