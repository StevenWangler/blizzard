  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorology: No accumulating snow, no active winter storm, temps ~30–35°F, freezing fog risk 5–10 AM, some patchy slick spots.\n  • History: This pattern (post‑system, patchy freezing fog, no snow/ice storm, temps around freezing) almost never produces closures in West Michigan; historical closure rates 2–5% with high confidence.\n  • Safety: Moderate overall risk, centered on black ice and reduced visibility between ~5–10 AM; primary roads passable, afternoon normal.\n  • News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring‑district closure notices, no large Kent County wave of closings, no strong social chatter expecting a snow day.\n  All four agree: there is no significant snow or ice storm, and conditions are marginal—not the kind that usually trigger district‑wide closure in Michigan.\n\n- Disagreement / tension:\n  • Meteorology frames the day as routine with only minor travel caution.\n  • Safety labels risk as \"moderate\" for the morning commute, with potentially significant but localized slick spots.\n  This is more about framing than substance: both describe patchy black ice and fog; neither suggests widespread, crippling conditions. There is no direct conflict about facts.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- New snow: 0\"; no active overnight snow means there is nothing for plows to \"clear\" in the traditional sense.\n- Main concern is refreeze and freezing fog creating glaze on existing wet surfaces.\n- Hazard window: approx. 5–10 AM, with the worst between about 6–8 AM—overlapping the bus commute.\n- Because the risk is thin glazing, road crews respond primarily with salt/brine, not heavy plowing. With no continuous precipitation, treatment can be proactive before buses roll.\n- Time from end of meaningful precip to first bell: prior mixed precip ends late evening Jan 6; first bell ~7:40 AM gives several hours for crews to treat primary routes and key secondary roads.\n  → Plow/salt timing is favorable compared with true snow events; there is no backlog of accumulation to move.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- There is no forecast ice storm or new freezing rain during the morning; precipitation probabilities are essentially zero.\n- Ice risk is from:\n  • Refreeze of prior wet surfaces as temps hover near/just below 32°F.\n  • Moisture deposition from freezing fog on cold pavement, especially untreated lots, bridges, and shaded rural segments.\n- Safety marks ice formation risk as \"high,\" but within the context of patchy black ice, not a widespread glaze. Meteorology explicitly notes \"no significant new snow or ice\" and characterizes roads as having \"some patchy slick spots\" rather than general hazardous coverage.\n  → This is a meaningful hazard that warrants caution and possibly spot route checks, but it does not reach the \"ice changes everything\" threshold of a true ice storm.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no closures or delays posted for Jan 7 as of late Jan 6.\n- Regional TV closing lists show no broad-based West Michigan closure wave.\n- Rockford’s own site lists school in session with no weather alert; no superintendent updates or emergency notices.\n- Social/media sentiment is quiet and uncertain—no clear \"everyone expects a snow day\" buzz.\n  → Per weighting rules: absence of neighboring closures and absence of strong community expectation argue firmly against raising the probability. Instead, they reinforce a very low likelihood.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per provided percentages)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates routine, marginal conditions with no snow or active icing event. On its own this suggests a closure probability in the 3–8% range.\n- Safety (25%): Flags moderate risk and significant morning‑commute impact from patchy black ice and fog, but also states primary roads are passable and afternoon is fine. That pushes slightly upward vs. meteorology alone, but not into typical closure territory—perhaps into the 7–12% range on its own.\n- History (20%): High‑confidence historical closure rates 2–5% for nearly identical setups, plus a seasonal adjustment downward because this is milder and less stormy than a typical closure day. This strongly pulls the combined estimate toward the low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no domino effect, no strong community expectation; this argues for staying near or even slightly below the historical baseline.\n\nCombining these:\n- Baseline from history + news: ~4–5%.\n- Upward adjustment for genuine but localized black‑ice risk during commute: +2–3 percentage points.\n- No upward adjustment from neighboring districts or community buzz (both neutral/negative in terms of closure odds).\n  → Final synthesized estimate: about 7% snow‑day probability.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Snow: 0\" – falls well below even the <4\" (5–15%) band; that band already assumes some actual accumulation, which we do not have.\n- There is no blizzard or ice storm; conditions are \"routine marginal winter\" for this region.\n- Michigan schools, particularly in Kent County, routinely operate through worse (light snow, more persistent cold) without closures.\n- Given the explicit guidance to avoid 40–60% unless there is real conflict, and the clear convergence of evidence toward a normal day, a very low probability with high confidence is appropriate.\n\n7. What would make this wrong?\nI would be wrong (true closure despite 7% estimate) if one or more of the following occurs unexpectedly:\n- Freezing fog becomes much denser and more widespread than forecast, dropping visibility near zero across a large part of the district exactly at bus time and persisting longer than expected.\n- A late‑developing band of freezing drizzle or unforecast light freezing rain redevelops before dawn, creating more uniform glazing on roads and parking lots.\n- A serious cluster of early‑morning crashes or emergency‑service reports prompts Kent County or multiple neighboring districts to close on safety grounds despite marginal meteorological signals.\n\nGiven the available data, these are plausible but low‑probability deviations. They justify monitoring conditions closely early in the morning, not preemptive closure.\n\nConclusion: The most consistent, cross‑checked interpretation of all four expert domains is that Rockford Public Schools will very likely have a normal school day on Wednesday, Jan 7, 2026. The estimated closure probability is about 7%, with high confidence.",
