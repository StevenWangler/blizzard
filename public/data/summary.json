    "No accumulating snow forecast (0\") and light winds → typical ‘schools open’ pattern in West Michigan",

    "Carryover/refreeze/black-ice risk on secondary & residential roads (salt less effective in extreme cold)",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures for Fri 01/30 as of latest checks (weak ‘closure momentum’)",

  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis (weighted by directive):\n1) Agreements: All experts agree there is no meaningful new snow expected for Rockford Friday and winds are light; the only plausible disruption is commute-time visibility (fog/ice fog) plus refreeze/black ice on untreated spots. \n2) Disagreements: The only major conflict was wind chill. Web verifier initially flagged sub -20°F feels-like, but follow-up shows Weather.com pages were inconsistent (including a Rockford, IL mis-match and wrong-date headers). No authoritative NWS point forecast was retrievable in-tool to confirm <= -20°F. Therefore I do NOT apply the near-automatic closure modifier.\n3) Plow timing math: With no new snow, this is not a “can plows keep up?” event. Infrastructure/safety both indicate major roads should be driveable by 06:30; remaining risk is last-mile neighborhood hard-pack/refreeze and bridge decks.\n4) Any ice? No freezing rain is forecast Friday, but refreeze/carryover ice risk is moderate (especially bridges, shaded roads, intersections).\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 01/30 closures/delays surfaced on nearby district sites or in the closings snippet. No +15–20% momentum bump.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages are extremely low; no clear evidence of Rockford-area facility outages. No outage bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: Dangerous <= -20°F is unconfirmed; most consistent date-specific source (WeatherAPI) is around -4 to -6°F at commute—unpleasant but not typically closure-triggering.\n8) What would make me wrong? If dense fog/ice fog becomes widespread and persistent (e.g., <=0.10–0.25 mi across most of the district through ~07:30–08:00) OR if secondary roads show widespread continuous glare ice causing operational failures (slide-offs, buses unable to safely turn/stop).\n\nProbability call: Baseline for “dry, cold, light wind” is low (single digits to teens). I raise to 22% mainly for the near-zero visibility risk window plus refreeze uncertainty (and the inability to fully verify NWS wind chill/visibility). This is more a DELAY setup than a full closure; the 22% reflects ‘closure’ specifically (not delay).",
