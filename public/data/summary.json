  "decision_rationale": "1. AGREEMENTS ACROSS EXPERTS\n- Meteorologist: Explicitly forecasts NO snow or ice, 0\" accumulation, and no precip through the school day.\n- Historian: Finds multiple strong analogs with this same dry, near-freezing pattern and reports a 0% historical snow-day rate for such setups, with high confidence.\n- Safety Analyst: Rates road and travel conditions in the 7.5–9/10 range, notes only localized black-ice risk, and explicitly states conditions do not justify a snow day or delay.\n- News/Intel: Finds no closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, no active closings on TV stations, and no active winter alerts for Kent County; community signal leans toward normal operations.\n=> All four agree there is no storm, roads are broadly fine, and nothing closure-level is expected.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- The only minor tension is the safety analyst flagging “moderate” ice-formation risk while meteorology shows no precip. This is easily reconciled: with temps near 30–32°F and very high humidity, isolated black ice on bridges and shaded spots is possible even in dry patterns, but not at a scale that drives closures in Michigan. All experts still converge on normal operations.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Forecast snowfall: 0\". No accumulating snow event is expected, so plow timing is essentially irrelevant.\n- With no falling snow, there is no ‘snow end time’ to work backward from. Roads are expected to be dry or only locally damp/patchy.\n- Any road work is routine salting/spot checks, not full plow operations. Effective ‘clear roads’ exist well before the 7:40 AM bell.\n=> Plow timing presents no constraint on opening; it effectively supports a 0–5% closure probability.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorology: 6 freezing-hours with temps around 27–30°F but no precipitation at any point; no freezing rain, drizzle, or snow.\n- Safety: Labels ice-formation risk as “moderate” specifically due to marginal temps and humidity, and appropriately recommends a 5:30–6:00 AM spot check of bridges and known trouble spots.\n- History: Notes that with no precip and daytime temps creeping above freezing, treated surfaces historically IMPROVE through the day.\n=> There is some non-zero chance of patchy black ice, but this is a routine Michigan winter hazard, not a system-wide closure trigger. It may justify cautious driving and a quick early-morning inspection, but not a snow day.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel confirms: no pre-announced closures for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, or Rockford itself.\n- FOX 17 closings page: no active school closings or delays for West Michigan related to this date.\n- No winter storm-level buzz or map of broad closures.\n=> The specific competition rule (+15–20% if 3+ neighboring districts close) clearly does NOT apply. If anything, the absence of any closures is further confirmation that this is a routine day.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nTo be wrong with a 1% forecast, one of the following would have to occur despite the current guidance:\n- An unforecast surprise event, e.g., a sudden lake-effect burst or freezing drizzle develops overnight and ices roads broadly; OR\n- A non-weather operational issue (major power outage, water main break, or unrelated emergency) prompts a closure unrelated to the forecast pattern; OR\n- A last-minute, ultra-cautious district decision based on isolated black-ice reports spreads across much of the region despite the dry forecast.\nAll of these are low-probability ‘tail’ events based on the available meteorology, history, safety assessment, and news intel.\n\n7. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Calls risk “effectively zero.” With no precip and temps near/above freezing, this justifies a base closure probability near 0–2%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low risk, normal operations recommended. This supports staying at the low end (0–5%).\n- History (20% weight): Multiple high-confidence analogs with 0% closure rate; this strongly anchors the probability near 0–1%.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight): No current or neighboring closures, no alerts, and no community chatter about bad roads. This rules out any upward adjustment.\nCombining these, the rational calibrated value is a non-zero but extremely small probability. To avoid an unrealistically absolute 0% (given tail risks), I set the final probability at 1%.\n\n8. DECISION\nGiven:\n- No snow, no ice storm, no accumulating precip.\n- Only routine winter cold and wind.\n- Historically zero closure rate in similar patterns.\n- No neighboring closures or warning signals.\nThe prediction is that Rockford Public Schools will operate on a normal schedule on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.\n\nSnow day probability (closure or full remote day): 1%.\nConfidence Level: Very High.\n\nThis should yield a very strong Brier score if, as expected, school is open ( (0.01 − 0)² = 0.0001 ).",
