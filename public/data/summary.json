  "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT DO ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON?\n- Meteorologist: About 3\" of straightforward snow, all-snow event, ending near or shortly after daybreak; winds under ~20 mph; no mixed precip or ice storm signal; typical West Michigan system.\n- Historian: Very similar past events (3–5\" overnight, tapering by commute, no extreme winds/cold) rarely close schools in Rockford/Kent County; historical closure rate ~5–15% for this pattern.\n- Safety analyst: Roads will be slick/snow-covered 5–7:30 AM, with significant but manageable morning commute impact; improvement through 8–10 AM; 2‑hour delay is the main mitigation, not an obviously necessary full closure.\n- News intel: No current Rockford or neighboring Kent County closures/delays posted; no strong community or media drumbeat expecting a snow day; districts are planning normal operations.\n\nCommon ground: This is a routine 3\" overnight snow event with a messy early commute but improving conditions after 8 AM. No ice storm, no blizzard, no extreme cold, and no existing closure domino effect.\n\n2. WHERE DO THEY DISAGREE?\n- Apparent conflict: Meteorologist labels closure likelihood as low; safety analyst labels overall road risk as “high.”\n- Cross-check resolution: Both are looking at the same weather but different questions:\n  • Meteorology: For a Michigan district, 3\" all-snow ending around daybreak is **normal operations** weather.\n  • Safety: Focused on operational weak spots: early rural routes, parking lots/sidewalks, and the fact that snow is still tapering right into the early bus window. That makes **5–7:30 AM conditions meaningfully hazardous**, even if not extraordinary.\n- Reconciled view: Conditions are **challenging but typical**: slick and somewhat hazardous early, but not severe enough to normally justify a full-day closure in Rockford. The higher safety “risk” points more toward considering a delay, not toward high odds of a full snow day.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (RELATIVE TO 7:40 AM START)\n- Snow end: Meteorology and safety both point to snow tapering and effectively ending around **7:00–7:30 AM**.\n- Safety analyst’s timing:\n  • Primary roads substantially cleared: **~8:15–8:45 AM** (about 1–1.5 hours after snow end).\n  • Main-route bus travel reasonably safe: **~8:00–8:30 AM**.\n  • Secondary/subdivision roads reasonably safe (still slick but serviceable): **~9:00–10:00 AM**.\n- At the scheduled **7:40 AM** start:\n  • Snow has only just ended or is still tapering.\n  • Plows are mid-catch-up; primaries and especially secondaries remain snow-covered and slick.\n- With a **2‑hour delay (start ~9:40 AM)**:\n  • You are 2.5–3.5 hours post-event.\n  • Primaries generally in good winter shape; secondaries improved to marginal but workable.\n\nConclusion: Plow timing clearly favors a **delay over an on-time start**, but does **not** indicate conditions stay bad enough, long enough, to justify a full-day closure.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Meteorologist follow-up: Temp profile 5–8 AM stays ~27–29°F, all-snow, no warm layer aloft, no freezing rain/sleet, and no freezing drizzle signal. After snow ends, skies turn overcast and cold but not into a rapid radiational refreeze scenario in the commute window.\n- Baseline risk: Surfaces remain below freezing, so roads/sidewalks will be slick and can compact to snow/ice, and there is later-day freezing fog risk. But **no organized ice storm or mixed precip**.\n\nConclusion: This is a **snow-only** event in the critical window. The absence of a true ice component keeps closure probability firmly in the low band.\n\n5. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS DOING?\n- News intel re-scan:\n  • Rockford: Official website still advertising school resuming Jan 5 with **no closure/delay banner** as of Sunday evening.\n  • Neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kentwood, GRPS, Kent ISD): No posted weather-related closures or delays for Jan 5.\n  • West Michigan TV closings portals: No active Kent County school closures/delays yet for Jan 5.\n- Community sentiment: Best described as “watching the weather,” not “we’re definitely getting a snow day.”\n\nPer your rules: No neighboring closures → **no +15–20% bump**. In fact, the lack of any early domino suggests admin expectations lean toward being open (possibly with a delay if conditions warrant).\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nMain ways the call could miss:\n- **Underestimated snowfall:** If actual totals run 5–6\" with higher rates near commute time, plows could be further behind, pushing conditions toward more serious hazard and making a closure more plausible.\n- **Operational constraints:** If Rockford’s rural routes are more extensive or under-resourced than assumed, or if there are equipment/personnel issues overnight, buses may not have safe access to key areas by even mid-morning.\n- **Surprise ice or banding:** A narrow, unmodeled band producing heavy rates closer to 6–8 AM or a patch of freezing drizzle could sharply worsen conditions, though current data shows this as unlikely.\n\nGiven current data, these are possible but low-probability deviations.\n\nPROBABILITY AND WEIGHTING\nUsing your weighting guidance:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): 3\" all-snow ending near daybreak, modest winds → baseline snow-day probability for <4\" in Michigan: about **10–15%**. I’ll use **12%**.\n- Safety (25% weight): Labels risk “high” for the **early commute**, recommends a 2‑hour delay as a strong option, and notes that full closure is a consideration mainly for very rural/hilly districts. This nudges probability above the bare meteorological baseline but does not imply >50%. I interpret as **~25%** chance of full closure, with delay more likely.\n- History (20% weight): Analog closure rate for this pattern: **5–15%**, mid-range around **10%**.\n- News/Community (20% weight – your “secret weapon”): No closure wave, no advisory focus on Kent County, community not expecting a snow day, Rockford still advertising school as normal. That **pulls the probability down slightly**, to around **8–10%** on this dimension.\n\nWeighted blend (approximate):\n- 0.35 × 12% ≈ 4.2\n- 0.25 × 25% ≈ 6.3\n- 0.20 × 10% ≈ 2.0\n- 0.20 × 9% ≈ 1.8\n→ Sum ≈ **14.3%**.\n\nI then adjust modestly upward to **18%** to account for:\n- Explicit safety analyst language: “significant” morning commute impact and high risk label.\n- Plow timing showing that **on-time** operation is legitimately questionable, which marginally increases the odds that an admin errs on the side of a full day off instead of a delay.\n\nThis 18% sits **within** your Michigan <4\" band (5–15%) but slightly above its upper edge to respect the strong safety caution, while still signaling a **decisively low** closure likelihood.\n\nImportantly, I avoid the 40–60% indecision zone: the evidence is not that conflicted; it leans clearly toward school being open, with a delay as a practical administrative compromise.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
