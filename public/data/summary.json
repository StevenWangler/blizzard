  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs disagreement\n- Agreement:\n  • All four domains show this is a post-storm day: worst weather is late evening Dec 30 through about 2–3 AM Dec 31, not during a school commute.\n  • Meteorology, history, and safety all indicate conditions by early morning are cold but manageable, with limited new snow, improving visibility, and plowable roads.\n  • No blizzard criteria, no heavy snow during the commute, and no extreme cold or widespread glazing-level ice are present.\n  • News intel confirms there is no active weather-driven closure decision on Dec 31 because Rockford is on Winter Break.\n- Disagreement:\n  • There is essentially no substantive conflict. Regional news emphasizes significant storm impacts over the broader period, but this aligns with the meteorologist’s and safety analyst’s view that the peak impacts occur before the hypothetical school day in question.\n\n2. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Safety timing analysis: worst conditions 9 PM Dec 30 – 3 AM Dec 31.\n- Meteorological summary: meaningful snow/mix 9 PM–1 AM with blowing snow; precip largely shuts down by 2–3 AM.\n- Assuming a normal Rockford start around 7:40 AM:\n  • Snow effectively ends: ~2–3 AM.\n  • First buses/commuters: ~6:30–7:40 AM.\n  • Plow window: roughly 3.5–5.5 hours of improving conditions and sub-freezing but workable temps (mid‑20s°F) for salt.\n- This is ample time for Kent County and local plows to clear primary and most secondary/bus routes; residual issues would be isolated slick spots, not system-wide inaccessibility.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Meteorology: Precip type for the overnight period in question is snow; earlier on Dec 30 there was light freezing rain mixed in, but amounts are low and taper by late evening.\n- Safety: ice-formation risk is rated “moderate,” not high; primary/secondary roads and parking lots score 8–9/10, suggesting some patches but not a glaze event.\n- History: explicitly notes this is not a significant, widespread icing scenario and that such moderate mixed-precip events almost never trigger closures when crews have an overnight window.\n- Conclusion: There may be some icy patches on untreated surfaces, but this is far below the “ice changes everything” threshold (no ice storm, no widespread glaze).\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: Officially on Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 4; no Dec 31 snow-day decision is posted or needed.\n  • Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): likewise on break; no targeted weather closure announcements for Dec 31.\n  • Earlier in the storm period there were “hundreds of closures,” but those correspond to earlier days and/or when school was in session elsewhere.\n  • Community sentiment is described as “uncertain,” focused on general travel caution rather than clamoring for a school closure.\n- Michigan rules from the prompt:\n  • 3+ neighboring districts closing for weather would merit a +15–20% boost. Here, that mechanism does not apply: the lack of school in session means there is no real-time domino effect to observe.\n  • Therefore, news intelligence strongly supports keeping the probability at the historically expected low level rather than bumping it up.\n\n5. Weighting the experts\nUsing the required weights:\n- Meteorology (35%):\n  • 0.5\" total new snow overnight, ending ~2–3 AM.\n  • Cold, breezy, but otherwise typical West Michigan winter day.\n  • No active storm during school hours.\n  → This strongly favors school being open; on the given Michigan threshold scale, <4\" with this timing implies about 5–15% baseline.\n- Safety (25%):\n  • Road scores (8–9/10) and minimal commute impact both morning and afternoon.\n  • Moderate ice risk, but manageable with standard treatment and caution.\n  → Supports the low-end snow-day probability (around 5–15%).\n- History (20%):\n  • Analog patterns have 5–10% historical snow-day rates.\n  • Seasonal adjustment of -0.15 reflects that Michigan operates through this type of weather routinely.\n  → Pushes the estimate toward the very low end of the range (~5–10%).\n- News Intelligence (20%):\n  • Secret weapon: reveals there is no actual snow-day decision to be made for Dec 31, as the district is on Winter Break.\n  • No neighboring-district weather closures specifically for this date, so no +15–20% bump.\n  • Community concern is about general storm impacts, not school operations.\n  → Reinforces that any hypothetical snow-day probability should remain in the single digits.\n\nSynthesizing these:\n- Meteorology suggests ~10% or less given <1\" overnight, good timing, and typical cold.\n- Safety suggests ~5–10% based on manageable roads and minimal commute disruption.\n- History suggests ~5–10% based on analog snow-day rates.\n- News intel blocks any upward adjustment and confirms no actual snow decision process on this date.\n\nGiven the Michigan-specific thresholds (<4\" → 5–15%) and the strong consensus across experts, I place the final hypothetical snow-day probability at 8% with high confidence. That keeps us within the 5–15% bracket but closer to the historical analogs’ 5–10% range.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThis 8% forecast would be wrong mainly if:\n- A last-minute, intense lake-effect band unexpectedly locks over Rockford from pre-dawn through the commute, dropping 4–8\" with near-whiteout conditions; or\n- A more serious, unforecast ice glaze develops overnight, significantly reducing friction on secondary roads and hills; or\n- Major infrastructure issues (e.g., large, localized power outage affecting many bus routes or buildings) develop in Rockford itself.\nThose would raise the true closure likelihood into the 30–60% or higher zones, but they are not supported by the current data.\n\nBottom line: For the specific date and conditions given, if school were in session, the odds of a snow day would be low, and in reality the question is moot because the district is already on Winter Break.",
