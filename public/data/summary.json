    "BINDING safety threshold: Web Weather Verifier flagged Weather.com wind chills ≤ -20°F (≈ -25°F to -26°F) during ~5–8 AM, which triggers the automatic 90–95% closure rule",
    "Even though most other inputs (WeatherAPI + meteorology + infrastructure) indicate a normal open day, Michigan districts often react to what parents see on Weather.com; reputational/safety pressure strongly favors closure if that reading persists into the evening/morning",
    "If wind chill truly is ≤ -20°F at bus-stop hours, buses can have start/reliability issues and frostbite risk becomes unacceptable regardless of road conditions",
    "No confirmed neighboring district closures yet and roads/plowing outlook is generally fine—these would normally keep probability low, highlighting the single-point conflict driving uncertainty",
    "Power grid/outages are minimal and not a closure driver"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "There is a major conflict between the WeatherAPI-driven meteorology package (temps ~21°F, wind chill ~+11°F, essentially no precip during 5–9 AM, and roads mostly clear) and the Web Weather Verifier’s Weather.com hourly scrape showing wind chills around -25°F to -26°F during 5–8 AM. Under the Extreme Cold Rules you provided, ONE credible source showing ≤ -20°F during bus hours is sufficient and is binding; it forces a 90–95% closure prediction regardless of other factors. \n\nCross-checking the other experts supports that, absent the extreme-cold signal, this would be a very low snow-day risk day (open with monitoring): no active snow/ice in the 5–9 AM window, modest winds, only patchy low visibility/black-ice concerns, and no neighboring closures posted yet. Power and infrastructure also do not support closure on their own. \n\nSo the probability is high not because roads/snow look bad, but because the operational decision environment in Michigan strongly prioritizes bus-stop safety at ≤ -20°F wind chills—and administrators/parents will treat Weather.com as authoritative if it continues to show that. Uncertainty remains moderate because the Weather.com data was noted as cached/out-of-sync; however, per your non-negotiable rule, that uncertainty cannot be used to lower the probability below the mandated range.",
