    "No accumulating snow expected Tuesday (0\" forecast), with light winds—Michigan districts typically remain open in this setup",
    "Main risk is localized patchy black ice from Monday’s light wintry mix + overnight refreeze (bridges/overpasses, shaded rural connectors, untreated subdivision streets)",
    "Patchy mist/freezing fog around 5–9 AM may briefly drop visibility (<0.5 mi in spots), increasing crash risk at bus/commute time",
    "Wind chill uncertainty exists (Weather.com colder than WeatherAPI), but even the colder credible values are not ≤ -20°F; extreme-cold automatic-closure rule is NOT triggered",
    "No confirmed neighboring district closures/delays and no community ‘closure buzz’ (no domino-effect pressure)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Cross-checking the six inputs, there’s strong agreement on the big picture: Tuesday is a no-new-snow day with light winds, so a full closure is unlikely in winter-hardened West Michigan. The only credible closure pathway is if Monday’s freezing drizzle/light mix left a more widespread glaze than expected AND Tuesday morning’s refreeze + patchy freezing fog creates broad hazardous traction during the 6–8 AM bus window.\n\nConflicts/uncertainty: The only material conflict is temperature/wind chill (WeatherAPI suggests feels-like around +11–13°F; Weather.com shows much colder -13 to -16°F). Per the directive, I lean toward the colder set for safety framing, but it still does not hit the ≤ -20°F automatic-closure threshold, and winds are modest—so cold alone should not drive a closure. Visibility ‘0 mi’ values appear to be an artifact; meteorologist indicates localized drops (possibly ~0.25 mi) rather than area-wide zero visibility.\n\nPlow timing math favors opening: precip impacts were Monday; there are ~17 hours until buses, giving MDOT/Kent County ample time for treatment. Infrastructure input suggests main routes passable; remaining issues are patchy and neighborhood-level. News intel shows no confirmed neighboring closures/delays and no community buzz, which keeps closure probability low.\n\nNet: I expect RPS to OPEN with heightened monitoring, with a higher likelihood of a 1–2 hour delay than a full cancellation if early road checks find widespread glaze (especially on secondary/rural routes).",
