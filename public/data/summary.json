  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, cold, dry pattern; explicitly estimates 5–10% chance of a snow/ice day. No significant snow or ice event aimed at Monday.\n- Historian: Similar patterns in early December (light prior icing, then dry/cold) historically yield very low closure rates (3–10%), especially when road crews have a full weekend. Says this does not match Rockford’s usual closure triggers.\n- Safety analyst: Primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10; risk level \"low\" and explicitly recommends normal operations for Monday.\n- News intel: No storm headlines, no winter alerts, no district or neighboring-district closure chatter, and no advance hints of a Monday closure.\nAll four agree: school is very likely open and Monday’s weather is routine for Michigan. There are no material conflicts in their core conclusions.\n\n2. Plow timing math (snow/plow vs. 7:40 AM)\n- Worst-weather window from safety analysis is confined to early Saturday (Dec 6), ending ~08:00 Saturday.\n- Saturday and Sunday are then cold but largely dry, with only light, scattered snow showers possible and no accumulation signal.\n- That provides roughly 48+ hours between the end of any meaningful weather and the Monday 7:40 AM start. Road crews have the whole weekend to scrape, salt, and improve surfaces.\n- With 0\" new accumulation expected Sunday night, there is effectively no plow timing risk for Monday morning.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Ice formation risk is assessed as \"moderate\" only in the sense of typical patchy refreeze on untreated surfaces with temps hovering around freezing.\n- Critically, there is **no ongoing freezing rain/drizzle event** expected into the Monday commute, and temperatures are not plunging into extreme cold that would overwhelm treatment.\n- Historically, Rockford tends to close for widespread glazing or active icing on main roads. Here, the data suggest only localized slick spots on back roads/parking lots – manageable with normal caution and operations.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel shows **no neighboring district closures** and no regional TV or social media chatter about a significant Monday storm.\n- Official RPS communication has no hint of a pre-emptive closure; recent notices are about a past Dec 3 event only.\n- Community sentiment is basically quiet/uncertain, not hyping a big storm or expecting a shutdown.\n- Under the competition rules, we would raise the probability 15–20% if several neighboring districts were already closing – but there are none, so no upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis and weighting\nWeights (per instructions): Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News 20%.\n- Meteorologist: 5–10% → midpoint ~7.5%\n- Historian: analog rates 3–10% → midpoint ~6.5%\n- Safety analyst: effectively implies ~5–10% closure risk (low, only residual ice) → midpoint ~7.5%\n- News intel: no signals of closure; consistent with ~5–10% → midpoint ~7.5%\nWeighted blend (rounded):\n- Meteorology (35% of 7.5) ≈ 2.6\n- Safety (25% of 7.5) ≈ 1.9\n- History (20% of 6.5) ≈ 1.3\n- News (20% of 7.5) ≈ 1.5\nTotal ≈ 7.3%, rounded to **7%**.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Expected new snow: ~0\" → well below the 4\" threshold where probabilities begin to rise (5–15% band).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard conditions, no 8+\" snow event, and no extreme cold wind chills (not near -15°F) that would trigger cold-related closure.\n- This places Monday squarely in the \"routine winter day\" category, right near the lower end of the 5–15% band.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe most likely ways to be wrong (i.e., an unexpected closure) would be:\n- A surprise localized freezing drizzle or black-ice event Sunday night that isn’t in the current guidance, producing widespread glazing on main roads by early Monday.\n- An unexpectedly intense, narrow lake-effect band Sunday night that drops several inches exactly over Rockford with poor timing before crews can respond.\n- A non-weather factor (major power outage, water main break, building issue) that forces closure despite benign weather.\nGiven all four expert streams, these are low-probability edge cases, but they justify not going all the way down to 0–3%.\n\nPutting it together: The converging evidence from meteorology, safety, history, and real-world news/community signals all indicate **school is overwhelmingly likely to be open**. A prediction of **7%** balances decisiveness with a small allowance for last-minute, localized ice or lake-effect surprises, while staying consistent with Michigan’s higher tolerance for winter conditions.",
