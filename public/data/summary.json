  "decision_rationale": "1) Expert agreement:\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, quiet day; no snow/ice, no alerts, roads dry, closure probability \"near zero.\"\n- Historian: Matching patterns have 0–1% historical snow-day rate; Rockford only closes for major snow/ice or dangerous cold, none present here.\n- Safety analyst: Roads and walking conditions are good (scores ~8–9.5/10); morning and afternoon commute impacts minimal; no weather justification for delay/closure.\n- News intel: District already lists Dec 22 as NO SCHOOL for Winter Break; no inclement-weather alerts, no social-media buzz, no road or power problems.\nAll four line up that weather impacts are negligible and that any lack of school is calendar-driven, not weather-driven.\n\n2) Conflicts and clarifications:\n- The only minor tension is that the safety analyst flags “moderate” ice-formation risk from residual damp spots, while meteorology shows no new precip and generally dry roads. This is easily reconciled: in Michigan cold, some isolated black ice is always possible, but not at scale to drive a snow day. There is no conflict on overall risk: all agree on low danger and normal operations capability.\n- No other material disagreements among experts.\n\n3) Plow timing math:\n- Forecast snow: 0.0\"; snow probability: 0% overnight and morning. That means there is nothing for plows to clear tied to this event.\n- Safety analysis explicitly states that road commissions “should have little to do beyond standard maintenance; primary and secondary routes and school lots/sidewalks should be in good shape by 6 AM.”\n- With no active snow and dry roads, the usual question of “hours from snow end to 7:40 AM” is moot: effective cleanup time is infinite, as there is no accumulation.\n\n4) Ice risk:\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no new precip, and dry conditions; temperatures stay below freezing but with no moisture source.\n- Safety analyst: Identifies only localized, background black-ice risk on bridges/untreated patches from prior days. This is a routine hazard, not a system-wide glaze event.\n- Conclusion: There is no organized ice event. Isolated slick spots are not enough to justify closure by Rockford standards.\n\n5) Neighboring districts:\n- News intel shows no neighboring districts closing for weather on this date and no weather-related announcements. The only closures in the region are winter-break calendar closures.\n- That means no +15–20% adjustment for regional weather closures is warranted.\n\n6) What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A surprise, unforecasted overnight system (snow or freezing rain) developing and depositing several inches or causing widespread ice between now and morning. Given 0% modeled precip and no alerts, this is low probability.\n- A sudden equipment/operations problem unrelated to weather (e.g., heating, power, or transportation failure) forcing a closure; this falls outside a weather-based snow-day model.\n- An error in the district calendar; however, multiple official sources confirm Dec 22 as Winter Break, and news intel finds no contradictory announcements.\n\n7) Weighting of experts:\n- Meteorology (35%): Shows no snow, no ice, no wind/cold extremes; this heavily suppresses weather-driven closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Road and travel risk are low, with minimal commute impact; endorses normal operational capability.\n- History (20%): Analog events virtually never result in closures; supports a near-zero probability baseline.\n- News Intel (20%): Confirms the closure on Dec 22 is scheduled Winter Break, not weather-related; also confirms no regional weather disruptions or buzz. This strongly reinforces a near-zero *weather-caused* closure chance.\nCombining these, the justified weather-related closure probability is essentially 0–2%. To avoid overconfidence while acknowledging small tail risks (unforecasted precip, infrastructure failures), I set the probability at 2% with very high confidence.\n\nInterpretation in context of thresholds:\n- Snow amount: 0\" → well below the <4\" Michigan threshold band (which itself would be only 5–15%).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no dangerous wind chills. All Michigan-specific high thresholds for closure are not met.\n- No neighboring district weather closures to add any upward adjustment.\nTherefore, a 2% snow-day probability is consistent with both the quantitative thresholds and the unanimous expert guidance that weather will not drive any additional closure beyond the already-scheduled Winter Break.",
