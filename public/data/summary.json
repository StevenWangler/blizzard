  "decision_rationale": "Cross-checking the experts: Meteorology, history, safety, and news all converge on a ‘cold but quiet’ setup with **no accumulating snow** and no active precip expected into Monday morning—this is typically one of the lowest snow-day patterns in Michigan. The only credible disruption pathway is **ice-type risk**: carryover glaze from earlier light freezing rain and/or freezing fog/ice fog producing patchy but meaningful slickness right during the 5:30–9:00 AM operations window. Infrastructure assessment supports roads being generally clear with only spot-treatment needs; power-grid assessment shows no evidence of a Kent County/Rockford-centered outage event that would force closure.\n\nKey conflict/uncertainty: apparent-temperature (wind chill) sources disagree, and at least one credible web source shows **≤ -20°F at times**. That’s a serious safety tail-risk, but it is not consistently indicated across sources for the 6–8 AM bus window in the provided summary. Given (a) no precip, (b) light winds in the main forecast feed, (c) no closure domino signals yet, the best Brier-score play remains **low single digits** for a full closure, while acknowledging a higher chance of a **2-hour delay** if early-morning spotters confirm widespread glaze or if the colder wind chill verifies at bus time.\n\nRecommendation: **OPEN with monitoring** as the base case; be prepared to pivot to a **2-hour delay** if pre-dawn road checks show widespread secondary-road icing or if verified wind chills drop into the -15 to -25°F range during bus-stop hours.",
