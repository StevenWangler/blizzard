  "decision_rationale": "1. What all four experts agree on:\n- Meteorology: The heavy storm and Winter Storm Warning end well before Monday; no significant snow, wind, or ice during the Monday morning commute.\n- History: Days like this—large weekend storm, then cold, dry Monday—almost always have school open; historical snow day rates are in the low single digits.\n- Safety: Roads and lots are rated good (8/10 primaries, 8/10 secondaries, 7/10 lots). Commute impact is labeled minimal with normal winter caution.\n- News/Intelligence: No closure chatter, no official warnings, no neighboring district plans to close; all communications point to a normal return from break on Monday.\nAll four point to normal but wintry operations, not closure conditions.\n\n2. Where they disagree:\n- Safety labels overall risk as “moderate” due to refreeze/ice-spot potential, while meteorology and history essentially frame Monday as routine winter conditions.\n- History suggests extremely low closure probabilities (~3–7%), while the safety lens leaves a bit more room for concern in poorly treated spots.\n- News intelligence doesn’t show any heightened concern yet, which aligns more with the meteorological/historical view than the cautious framing of the safety analyst.\nNet effect: slight tension between cautious safety language vs. historically and meteorologically low risk, but not true disagreement on likely open status.\n\n3. Plow timing math (end of snow to 7:40 AM):\n- Heavy snow warning ends: Sunday 11/30 at 10:00 AM.\n- School-day bus window: roughly Monday 12/1 from 6:30–7:40 AM.\n- Time between end of main snow and bus window: about 21–22 hours.\nThat is ample time for Kent County/RPS plows and private contractors to clear major routes, bus loops, and lots—especially given no significant new accumulation during that overnight period.\n\n4. Is there any ice?\n- Forecast shows all snow; no freezing rain or mixed precipitation signal on Monday.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing with high humidity/mist, so patchy refreeze and slick spots are possible, but this is routine black-ice risk, not an ice storm or glazing event.\n- In the Michigan threshold framework, this does NOT qualify as an “ice” scenario that would push probabilities into the 60–85% range.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- Forest Hills, Sparta, Cedar Springs, Lowell, Greenville, and other Kent ISD districts: no closure alerts, no early-dismissal plans, and no special weather guidance for Monday.\n- Kent ISD itself has no regional coordination notice or inclement-weather advisory targeting that date.\n- This means: 0 neighboring districts closed (or even signaling likely closure), so there is no +15–20% upward adjustment from the NEWS rule.\n\n6. What would make me wrong?\nKey failure modes that could raise the true closure chance above 8%:\n- Actual storm totals on Sunday significantly exceed 7–10\" and plow operations fall behind in rural parts of the district, leaving bus routes unsafe by early Monday.\n- An unforecast band of lake-effect snow sets up Sunday night into early Monday, producing several fresh inches and low visibility right during the commute.\n- Unexpected freezing drizzle or black ice event overnight that dramatically worsens traction beyond what standard salting can handle.\n- Multiple neighboring districts detect worse on-the-ground conditions than guidance suggests and decide to close or delay early Monday, pressuring Rockford to follow.\nThese all require forecast error or operational failure; none are indicated strongly by current data.\n\nWeighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates a classic “post-storm cleanup” Monday—cold, dry, no accumulating snow during commute, winds light, no ice storm. Baseline from this alone: ~5–10% closure risk.\n- Safety (25%): Road/lot scores are good-to-very-good, commute impact minimal; moderate refreeze risk but manageable with proper salting. This nudges probability only slightly above the extreme low end: add a couple of percentage points.\n- History (20%): Analog patterns show 3–7% closure rates, with high confidence around ~3% when heavy snow is finished the day before and plows have overnight to work. This strongly pulls the estimate toward the low single digits.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No buzz, no neighboring-district moves, no county-level coordination. This supports the lower end, since in genuine edge cases there is usually at least some chatter or pre-positioning. No upward adjustment from the NEWS rules (no neighbors closed, community expectation is clearly “school resumes Monday”).\n\nPutting it together numerically:\n- Start from historical analog: ~5%.\n- Meteorology (storm done, no active hazards) keeps it in the 5–8% band.\n- Safety (moderate refreeze risk) justifies a slight bump: +1–3 percentage points.\n- News Intelligence gives no reason to raise it (no neighboring closures, no expectation of closure), and arguably trims the high end of the range.\nFinal, decisive estimate: 8% chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.\n\nThis stays outside the 40–60% “mushy middle,” is consistent with Michigan’s higher snow tolerance, and aligns with both the quantitative historical rates and the current real-world signals.",
