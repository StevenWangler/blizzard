  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis and weighting (Meteorology 25%, Safety 20%, History 15%, News 15%, Infrastructure 10%, Power 10%, Web verifier 5%):\n\n1) Agreements across experts: All core ops experts (meteorology/history/safety/news) agree this is NOT an active snowstorm morning for Rockford; the closure mechanism would be residual ice/refreeze + cold, not new snow. They also agree main roads should be passable, with the biggest risk on neighborhood roads, bridges, and parking lots.\n\n2) Disagreements/conflicts: The only major conflict is wind chill. WeatherAPI suggests wind chills around ~0°F to about -5°F for the commute, while a stale Weather.com crawl snapshot showed ≤ -20°F (an auto-closure threshold in your rubric). A tool refresh could not retrieve live NWS (timeout) and could not confirm Monday 5–9 AM hourly rows from Weather.com, so ≤ -20°F is NOT confirmed for the commute. This uncertainty raises probability slightly but does not dominate.\n\n3) Plow timing math: Safety clarified worst window 00:00–04:00 is refreeze/visibility, not snowfall. Assuming no new precip after ~04:00, there are ~3h40m before a ~07:40 bell, plus crews are typically already working before 04:00 on priority routes. That amount of time in Kent County usually prevents full closure, though it can still justify a delay if bus-route spot checks find widespread untreated slickness.\n\n4) Any ice? Yes—moderate risk of black ice/residual slick spots is consistently flagged (safety + infrastructure + history). No meaningful Monday-morning freezing rain is forecast; the ‘light freezing rain’ signal is late Monday night (more a Tuesday concern).\n\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Mon 1/26 closures/delays on Rockford, GRPS, Kentwood, Cedar Springs, or Forest Hills pages during checks. No ‘3+ neighboring districts closed’ trigger.\n\n6) Power outages: Consumers Energy systemwide shows low outages (scattered). No evidence of a countywide outage event that would override road conditions.\n\n7) Wind chill cross-check: Not confirmed ≤ -20°F for the Monday commute due to data freshness and retrieval issues. Because the only ≤ -20°F evidence is stale/unverified, I do NOT apply the near-automatic closure rule, but I keep some tail risk.\n\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) If live NWS/verified sources show wind chill ≤ -20°F at 6–8 AM, closure odds jump dramatically; (b) if early-morning road checks reveal widespread glazing on bus routes (not just spotty slickness), a 2-hour delay or closure becomes more likely; (c) an unanticipated overnight freezing drizzle event.\n\nBottom line: With no new accumulation, no confirmed neighbor closures, and only moderate residual-ice risk, a FULL snow day is unlikely. I set 14% (slightly above the team’s ~11% consensus) mainly because infrastructure notes persistent ice in this cold pattern and wind-chill verification remains unresolved.",
