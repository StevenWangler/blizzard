    "Primary closure driver is extreme cold exposure at bus stops; at least one high-reliability source (Weather.com) indicates wind chills/feels-like around -25°F to -26°F during 05:30–08:00",
    "Major forecast discrepancy: WeatherAPI keeps 05:30–08:00 wind chills notably warmer (about -16°F to -10°F). This uncertainty is the main reason probability is not higher",
    "Trace/very light freezing rain/freezing drizzle potential + rapid overnight cooling → black ice risk on bridges/ramps and secondary/local bus-route roads despite negligible snow accumulation",
    "Road treatment likely makes trunklines/arterials mostly passable by ~06:30, but local/neighborhood segments may remain variable and slick in spots",

  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis and weighting (Meteorology 25%, Safety 25%, History 15%, News 15%, Infrastructure 10%, Power 5%, Web verify 5%):\n1) Agreement: All experts agree snow accumulation is negligible and the only meaningful hazards are (a) extreme cold exposure and (b) patchy ice/black ice from trace freezing precip/refreeze. Power outage risk is not currently a driver.\n2) Disagreement: The key conflict is wind chill severity during the bus window. WeatherAPI suggests bus-window wind chills mostly above the automatic threshold (>-20°F), while Weather.com shows multiple hours ≤ -20°F (roughly -25°F). Web verifier flags this as a major discrepancy and cannot confirm ≤ -20°F across TWO independent hourly sources.\n3) Plow timing math: Precip/icing risk is mainly Thu evening to ~midnight, giving ~6+ hours to 06:30 for treatment. Infrastructure expects main routes mostly drivable by 06:30, but secondary/local bus-route segments remain variable due to extreme cold reducing salt effectiveness. This supports ‘delay more likely than closure’ framing.\n4) Ice: Yes—patchy glaze/black ice is plausible; that elevates risk even with no snow.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 1/30 closures/delays located in checks; therefore no +15–20% boost.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages very low (17 customers affected reported); no evidence of widespread heating/power failure risk.\n7) Wind chill verification: Threshold risk is plausible (Weather.com ≤ -20°F), but not corroborated by a second hourly source; hence not a near-automatic closure call.\n8) What would make this wrong: If NWS/Kent County messaging and multiple sources verify sustained ≤ -20°F wind chills at 06:00–08:00, closure odds jump sharply. Conversely, if wind chills are closer to -10°F to -15°F and icing is minimal, odds drop and school likely opens (possibly with a delay).\n\nFinal calibration: Baseline for ‘no snow, but patchy ice + very cold’ is low-to-low-moderate. I’m setting 30% for a full closure because (i) a credible source indicates wind chills below the -20°F threshold at bus time and (ii) black ice risk on secondary roads is non-trivial in extreme cold. Lack of confirmed neighboring closures, low outage risk, and likely-passable main roads keep it from rising above ~35–40%.",
