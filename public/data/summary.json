  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Cold, quiet day; 0\" new snow, no ice, normal winter wind and visibility, essentially 0% snow-day risk from weather.\n- Historian: Similar past patterns (dry, mid-20s°F, no alerts) have ~1–2% closure rates in West Michigan; closures typically require active heavy snow, significant ice, or extreme cold—none present.\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely in good shape with treatment from the prior day; minor slick spots only; risk level explicitly \"low\" and states weather alone does not justify a closure or delay.\n- News Intel: Jan 2 is a scheduled winter-break day, not a weather closure; regional weather is wintry but not extreme, and there is no signal of a special weather-based shutdown.\n=> Consensus: Weather is routine for Michigan; no snow-day-caliber event; and school is not in session anyway.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Very minor tension: meteorological feed here shows 0\" snow and fully dry conditions, while broader news coverage mentions ongoing lake-effect snow in the region into Jan 2 with several inches possible in parts of West Michigan. However, the local expert summaries (meteorology, history, safety) all converge on: no impactful new accumulation for Rockford itself during the school window, no active alerts, and treated roads.\n- All four agree on low risk for a weather-driven closure. There is no substantive disagreement about hazards for Rockford.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Provided meteorological analysis shows 0% snow probability overnight and in the morning; effectively, there is no new snow event to clear between midnight and the bus window.\n- Any prior light snow/freezing drizzle occurred on Thursday (Jan 1). Safety notes that Thursday evening treatment and traffic should leave primary/secondary roads in good to very good shape by Friday morning.\n- With no ongoing snow, plows and salt crews have the entire night and early morning to clean up and re-treat any slick spots. Functionally, that’s many hours (likely 8+ hours) between last meaningful precip and a typical start time like 7:40 AM.\n- Result: Plow timing is extremely favorable; there is no active storm compressing cleanup time.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorologist: explicitly states no freezing rain or mixed precip for Friday; just cold, dry conditions.\n- Historian: mentions previous day had some light freezing rain/snow but in small amounts, with improving conditions into Friday.\n- Safety: flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk only in the sense of refreeze on untreated moisture—residual slick spots on side streets, lots, bridges. Primary/secondary roads scored 8–9/10.\n- News Intel: No reports of widespread, crippling glazing or power issues in Rockford/Kent County on Jan 2.\n=> There may be patchy black ice on untreated surfaces, but not a systemic ice storm. This is below the district’s usual closure threshold.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News Intel: Kent ISD-area districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, etc.) share a similar winter-break window. They are not announcing snow days for Jan 2 because school is not scheduled; closures are calendar-based, not weather-based.\n- No cluster of emergency weather closures or domino-effect decisions exists for this date.\n=> Per the competition rules, we would normally adjust if 3+ neighbors closed for weather (+15–20%), but here the surrounding non-session status is unrelated to weather, so no upward snow-day probability adjustment is warranted.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Upside risk (actual closure higher than predicted):\n  • A localized, unforecast lake-effect band sets up squarely over Rockford overnight, dropping several inches (4\"+) of sudden snow and creating hazardous, snow-covered roads by morning.\n  • A surprise freezing drizzle event ices over treated roads, creating a de facto ice storm with many accidents.\n  • Non-weather operational issues (major power outage, heating failure, transportation breakdown) prompt a closure on a day that would otherwise be school in session.\n- Downside risk (probability overstated):\n  • Since Jan 2 is officially part of winter break, the true “weather-related snow day probability” is arguably 0%, because there is no decision to make. Assigning 1% covers only the very low chance of a misinterpreted or emergency-style weather closure on some unscheduled activity.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong, detailed signal of calm, cold, dry weather—no snow, no ice, no visibility crisis, no alerts. On Michigan thresholds (<4\" with no ice → 5–15% under normal circumstances), this event sits at the very bottom of that range, effectively near 0 since even the 4\" threshold is not met.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road and walking conditions rated good; ice risk limited to isolated untreated spots. Safety explicitly states low likelihood that weather alone would justify a snow day or delay.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs with similar parameters yield only about a 1–2% closure rate. This aligns with the meteorological and safety assessments and anchors the lower bound.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight – the \"secret weapon\"): Confirms:\n  • Rockford is on winter break through Jan 4; Jan 2 is not a regular school day.\n  • Neighboring districts are likewise on break; there is no regional wave of weather closures.\n  • Community chatter treats this as typical winter weather, not a major emergency.\n  This strongly pushes the effective weather-driven snow day probability toward 0, since there is literally no in-session decision to flip to \"closed.\"\n\nPROBABILITY DECISION\n- If this were a normal session day with this exact forecast (no snow, no ice, calm cold), meteorology + history + safety would imply on the order of 1–3% closure risk.\n- Given that Jan 2 is actually a planned no-school day, the relevant question becomes: what is the chance of a *weather-related* snow day decision? That is effectively at the floor—there is no need for such a decision, and no indication of emergency closure of facilities.\n- To avoid a deceptive literal 0 while remaining realistically at the floor for Brier scoring, I set:\n  • Snow day probability = 1%\n\nThis respects the low-but-nonzero noise level historically, while recognizing that all four expert domains—including the decisive calendar intel—argue overwhelmingly against a weather-driven snow day.\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL\n- Agreement across all experts is unusually strong, and the forecast is simple (no mixed precip, no storm). \n- The only notable uncertainty is the small possibility of an unmodeled localized band or surprise icing, which history suggests is rare at this level.\n- Therefore, confidence is VERY HIGH that there will be no additional weather-based snow day decision for Rockford on Friday, Jan 2, 2026.",
