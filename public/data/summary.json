  "decision_rationale": "1) Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Forecast shows temps ~30–33°F, no measurable snow, no rain/freezing rain, and only freezing fog around daybreak. Visibility around 6 miles, winds modest, no alerts. Their own narrative states weather-based closure probability is effectively near 0%.\n- History (20% weight): Comparable patterns (near-freezing, dry, patchy freezing fog, no storm, no alerts) have essentially a 0% historical snow-day rate in Kent County/Rockford. They emphasize that actual snow/ice storms or extreme cold are typically required for closure.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates primary roads 8.5/10, secondary 7.5/10, parking 7.5/10, with moderate ice-formation risk from freezing fog 4–8 AM. Morning commute impact: moderate, afternoon minimal. They explicitly recommend routine treatment and inspection, not closure.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): Confirms Rockford is closed for winter break Dec 22–Jan 2. Neighboring districts are similarly on break, with no special weather closures or storm alerts. Community sentiment is essentially silent on weather threats.\n\nAll four agree:\n- No storm, no accumulating snow, and no significant ice event on 12/25.\n- Conditions are typical/benign for West Michigan winter.\n- There is no active snow-day-style decision to be made because school is already closed for break.\n\nMinor differences:\n- Safety flags a \"moderate\" ice risk in the 4–8 AM window due to freezing fog; meteorology characterizes this as only isolated slick spots and still very low impact overall. This is a difference in emphasis, not in core facts.\n- No expert presents any scenario where widespread hazardous travel or system-wide school closure would be warranted.\n\nGiven the developer thresholds (Michigan-specific) and weights:\n- Base meteorological closure probability: ~0–2% (rounding up from \"near 0\" for black-ice uncertainty).\n- Historical adjustment: pushes this toward 0%, but I keep a 1% floor to avoid an overconfident 0 in a Brier-scored competition.\n- Safety: moderate but localized ice risk could, in principle, create very rare localized issues; this justifies not going fully 0.\n- News intelligence: Strongly supports that any closure is holiday-based, not weather-based; no neighboring weather closures to bump probability up.\n\nPlow timing math (hours from worst conditions to school time):\n- Worst conditions: 4–8 AM, with freezing fog and temps 31–33°F.\n- Hypothetical school start ~7:40 AM: conditions would still be near their worst between 6–8 AM. However, there is no fresh snow to plow; only salting and spot treatment for potential black ice are needed. Kent County and district crews routinely handle this scale of risk even in live school days.\n\nIce assessment:\n- There is some risk of thin ice from freezing fog on untreated surfaces (bridges, parking lots, shaded sidewalks). Safety labels ice risk as moderate, but meteorology and history both indicate this is patchy and not associated with any storm or accumulating precip.\n- Crucially, there is no modeled freezing rain, glaze event, or broad ice storm; just marginal conditions at or just below freezing.\n\nNeighboring districts:\n- All checked neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) are on winter break with no special weather-driven closure notices.\n- No \"3+ neighboring districts closing for weather\" effect applies, so no +15–20% bump.\n\nWhat would make this prediction wrong?\n- An unforecast freezing-drizzle or ice event overnight, dramatically increasing ice coverage beyond \"patchy\" and causing widespread crashes before crews can respond.\n- A previously unaccounted-for, last-minute policy change where the district decides to tag a weather closure label onto a day already on break (administratively unlikely and not reflected in current signals).\n\nIntegrating all four expert domains with assigned weights yields an effective weather-driven closure probability very close to 0%. To remain calibrated and avoid overconfident zero in a competitive scoring framework, I set:\n\n- Final snow day probability (weather-related): 1%\n- Confidence: very high, because all experts converge on a quiet, non-storm day and the district is already closed for winter break.\n\nThis explicitly separates: (a) the academic/holiday closure (100% certain), from (b) the hypothetical *weather-caused* closure decision, which is what the probability represents.",
