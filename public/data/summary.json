  "decision_rationale": "All four core experts (meteorology/history/safety/news) converged tightly (7–9%, avg ~8%) on a low full-closure risk for Rockford on Tue 2/3 because the forecast shows no new snow/ice during bus hours and light winds, giving road crews ample time to recover from Monday’s wintry mix. The main plausible failure mode is a ‘cleanup + deep refreeze’ morning: any Monday drizzle/moisture that wasn’t fully treated can freeze hard with an overnight low near 3°F, creating patchy black ice—more likely on secondary/rural roads and bridges than on trunklines/major arterials. Visibility is the biggest wildcard: the meteorology clarification indicates the worst fog/visibility restriction is more likely 1–4 AM, with only a smaller possible dip near 7–8 AM; that timing makes a district-wide cancellation unlikely (a delay is the more typical Michigan response if pockets are slick). \n\nPotential conflict resolved: Web verification shows a large Weather.com vs WeatherAPI temperature/feels-like mismatch, but even the colder Weather.com scenario (~0°F with -13 to -16°F feels-like) does NOT cross the ≤-20°F automatic-closure rule, and winds are light. Therefore, temperature uncertainty alone doesn’t justify a high closure probability; it mainly increases refreeze persistence and supports a ‘watch for delay’ posture rather than a full snow day.\n\nRecommendation (operational): OPEN with monitoring as the base case; the realistic operational adjustment, if needed, is a 2-hour delay (not a closure) if early bus checks find widespread untreated ice or freezing fog glaze during 6–8 AM.",
