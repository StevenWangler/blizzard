  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist:\n1) Agreement across experts: all four converge that (a) temperatures stay well below freezing, (b) snow amounts in the provided point forecast are modest (nuisance-level), (c) the real risk is timing + a pre-dawn wintry mix/ice, and (d) this setup favors a DELAY more than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: News intel highlights an advisory with 2–5\" possible in Kent County, while the meteorology point forecast supports ~1–2\" total and <1\" by 7:40 AM. I resolved this by weighting the location-specific point forecast higher for Rockford amounts, while treating the advisory as a “higher-end banding” scenario that could still happen.\n3) Plow timing math: Safety analyst notes worst conditions end ~08:30, which is 50 minutes AFTER the 07:40 bell (i.e., no recovery window before start time). However, Michigan crews can keep main roads passable; the key issue is secondary roads and bus routes.\n4) Ice: Yes—trace to very light glaze (~0.00–0.02\") possible 03:00–04:00. Not a major ice storm, but enough for patchy slick spots.\n5) Neighboring districts: No verified closures/delays found yet; no “3+ neighboring districts closed” bump applied.\n6) What would make me wrong: (a) the advisory verifies at the high end in/near Rockford (band arrives earlier/stronger, yielding 2–4\" by morning), (b) freezing rain is more than a trace and widespread, or (c) early-morning incidents/slide-offs spike on secondary roads.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 35% (points to modest snow + light glaze), Safety 25% (high secondary-road slickness + overlap with commute), History 20% (typical outcome is delay > closure for this pattern), News 20% (advisory messaging increases risk ceiling but lacks confirmed district actions).\n\nResult: A FULL snow day is still unlikely in Rockford given modest expected accumulation by start time and no confirmed neighboring closures; the more probable operational outcome is a 1–2 hour delay. Therefore, snow-day (cancellation) probability set to 18% (decisively low, but not single-digits due to ice + timing).",
