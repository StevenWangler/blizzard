  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- All four domains agree Monday, Dec. 29 will feature a high-impact winter weather period in West Michigan:\n  • Meteorologist: 2–3\" of snow locally, strong WNW–NW winds (20–27 mph, higher gusts), blowing/drifting, and periods of near-zero visibility during typical school commute hours.\n  • Historian: Analog events with similar wind, visibility, and lake-enhanced snow have produced school closures/delays in about 30–40% of cases when school is in session, especially when worst conditions are 5–9 AM.\n  • Safety analyst: High road safety risk with a severe morning commute impact; flash-freeze risk under new snow; strong recommendation to strongly consider closure or at least a delay if school were running.\n  • News intel: NWS/regional media highlight hazardous travel and whiteouts Monday with 3–6\" in favored zones and 50+ mph gusts; infrastructure still stressed from a recent ice storm.\n- All agree there is **no major ice storm during school hours** (icing is mostly as a flash-freeze/icy base under snow, not thick glaze accumulating on powerlines and trees Monday morning).\n- All agree Rockford/Kent County are well-practiced in handling moderate snow events, but timing and visibility make this one more disruptive than a routine 2–4\" day.\n\n2. Expert disagreement/conflict:\n- Impact on *school operations*:\n  • Meteorology, history, and safety all imply a **borderline but plausible snow day or delay** if school were in session (roughly 30–50% closure likelihood on a typical school day under these conditions).\n  • News intel, however, makes clear that **Rockford Public Schools are already on Winter Break** through early January, with Jan. 5 as the return date. That means **no official snow day decision is being made for Dec. 29.**\n- Snow totals:\n  • Meteorologist: 2–3\" focused on Rockford.\n  • News intel/NWS regional coverage: 3–6\" for broader West Michigan favored belts. This is not a major conflict; it reflects local vs. regional variations and lake-effect banding.\n\nGiven the competition context, I must forecast the probability of a *snow day*. Because the district is not scheduled to hold school, the chance of a weather-based snow day decision is effectively near zero, regardless of how hazardous conditions become.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to ~7:40 AM):\n- Worst conditions are expected from about 5 AM to early afternoon (around 2 PM). That means at a typical middle/high school start time (~7:40 AM), snowfall and blowing snow are **ongoing and near peak**, not ending.\n- Therefore, the key operational issue is not “time to clean up after the snow,” but “plows working during an active, visibility-limited event.” Heavy bursts and drifting can quickly re-cover treated roads, and rural routes in particular would remain challenging through the usual bus window.\n- If this were a normal school day, the plow timing strongly **favors closure or delay** because you don’t get a pre-commute lull to clean up.\n\n4. Ice risk:\n- Meteorology: Temps hover near freezing then fall; precipitation type during the critical window is snow, not freezing rain. However, the prior day’s significant rain and saturated surfaces mean **flash-freeze and icy underlayer risk is high**, especially on bridges, hills, and side roads.\n- Safety: Explicitly flags ice formation risk as **high**, emphasizing slick parking lots, sidewalks, and side streets.\n- History: Notes this rain-to-snow flash-freeze setup as an unusual factor that raises closure risk in comparable past events.\n- There is **no major accruing ice storm Monday morning**, but enough refreeze to notably worsen traction under the snow. This meaningfully elevates hazard but does not by itself create a separate ice-storm category event.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel: No neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have posted Dec. 29 weather closures; most are also on winter break.\n- There is **no active chain of school closings** to leverage for community/peer pressure. Under the provided rules, the +15–20% adjustment for 3+ neighboring closures does **not** apply.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- The only way a “snow day” in the conventional sense could occur is if:\n  • Rockford or a comparable district unexpectedly held classes or mandatory activities on Dec. 29 despite calendars saying break, and then\n  • They chose to cancel those due to weather.\n- News intel, district calendars, and current communications all show Dec. 29 as part of Winter Break, with no regular classes. That makes the probability of a formal snow day extremely small.\n- Another potential pitfall would be misinterpreting the question as “Would conditions *justify* a snow day if school were in session?” In that hypothetical, I’d place the probability roughly in the **35–45%** range based on:\n  • Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly disruptive timing/visibility but only 2–3\" local snow.\n  • Safety (25%): High risk, explicitly recommends closure/delay.\n  • History (20%): 30–40% historical closure rate for similar setups.\n  • News (20%): Strong hazard messaging but no closure signals. \n  That blended signal would argue for something near the upper end of the 4–6\" Michigan threshold range. However, the competition framework requires forecasting the *actual* snow-day outcome, not the hypothetical.\n\nWEIGHTED FINAL DECISION\nUsing the instructed weightings for the real-world situation on Dec. 29:\n- Meteorology (35%): Conditions are severe enough that, on a typical school day, closure/delay would be a real possibility.\n- Safety (25%): Rates risk as high; again, this supports closure if school existed.\n- History (20%): Puts similar setups at 30–40% closure historically.\n- News intelligence (20%): This is decisive here. It shows **no school in session** and no neighboring district closures. That collapses the effective probability of an official “snow day” to near zero, regardless of what the weather would otherwise warrant.\n\nAdjusting for Michigan-specific thresholds:\n- Forecast accumulations (~2–3\" locally) are below the 4\" threshold where Michigan snow-day probabilities normally begin to rise.\n- Strong winds, whiteouts, and icy underlayers make it a high-impact travel event, but this mostly influences hypotheticals and general safety guidance, not the existence of a school-day decision.\n\nPutting this together, I set the **snow_day_probability at 5%**:\n- >0% to allow for edge cases (e.g., unexpected programming or misalignment in calendars),\n- But very low because the district calendar and neighboring signals overwhelmingly indicate no formal snow-day decision will be made for Dec. 29.\n\nThe confidence level is **high** because the news/calendar intelligence (your secret weapon) is unambiguous, even though the weather itself is high impact.\n",
