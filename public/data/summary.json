  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT VS. DISAGREEMENT\n- Meteorologist: Quiet weather day – cold, foggy at times, but 0% snow probability and no accumulating precip. Clearly states forecast does NOT support a traditional snow day.\n- Historian: Very low historical snow-day rates (1–3%) for nearly identical setups (cold, gray, maybe foggy, no storm). High confidence in “school as usual.”\n- Safety Analyst: Road scores of 8–9/10, low overall risk, and explicitly says a delay or closure is not indicated. Morning commute impact: minimal.\n- News/Intel: District calendar and announcements show a normal return. No neighboring districts have pre-announced closures or delays. Community sentiment is weather-watching but not “this is a major storm.”\n\nAll four are aligned: conditions are routine for west Michigan winter and do not support a closure.\n\nNo material conflicts:\n- The only nuance is that meteorology flags dense/freezing fog possible late day and overnight, while safety notes morning visibility is still good (6–10 miles) with main fog concerns later. That’s timing nuance, not a contradiction.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New snow forecast: 0\". No overnight or morning snow, so there is effectively nothing new to plow ahead of the school day.\n- Road work is limited to scraping/treating residual compacted snow/ice from previous events and pre-treating for any later freezing fog.\n- With no active accumulation, plow timing relative to a snow end time is irrelevant; roads are already in high condition (8–9/10) going into the morning. From a “snow end → 7:40 AM” perspective, it’s effectively infinite hours of lead time.\n\n3. ICE / FREEZING RISK\n- Temps: mid-20s overnight, upper 20s around commute, rising into low–mid 30s later.\n- Meteorology: no freezing rain; precip type is technically “mixed” but with zero measurable precip. Main concern is freezing fog creating thin glaze on some surfaces.\n- Safety: labels ice formation risk as “moderate” but still rates roads and lots 8–9/10; warns about localized black ice on bridges/untreated secondary roads and suggests salting lots/sidewalks, especially for evening.\n\nThere is some patchy ice risk, but not a true “ice event” (no storm, no widespread glazing, no advisory-level icing). Under the Michigan thresholds given, this is far below the kind of ice that pushes probabilities into the 60%+ range.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford: Official calendar simply says “School Resumes” Jan 5; no conditional language, no snow-day posts.\n- Neighboring districts checked (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): no closure or delay postings yet for Jan 5.\n- Local media: covering an active winter pattern and earlier storms, but nothing tying Jan 5 specifically to likely closures.\n- Social/Community sentiment: best described as uncertain/normal weather-watching, not confidently expecting a closure.\n\nPer the weighting rules: no neighboring closures → no +15–20% bump; no strong “we’re definitely closing” buzz → no +10–15% bump.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH REQUIRED WEIGHTS)\nBase expert-derived probabilities before weighting:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Given 0\" snow, no precip, routine cold, but some fog: about 3–5% chance of a surprise fog-based delay/closure. I’ll assign 4%.\n- Safety (25% weight): With high road scores and explicit statement that no delay/closure is indicated: ~3% (allowing for rare surprises like unexpected dense freezing fog on key routes).\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs show 1–3% snow-day rate. Take 2%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): All signals show normal operation, no preemptive closures, no neighboring shutdowns. That supports something like 2–4%; use 3% to reflect tiny chance of late-breaking decision.\n\nWeighted blend:\n0.35*4% + 0.25*3% + 0.20*2% + 0.20*3% \n= 1.4% + 0.75% + 0.4% + 0.6% ≈ 3.15%.\n\nMichigan baseline thresholds say:<4\" snow → 5–15%. Here we have 0\" snow and no storm; that justifies going *below* even the 5% lower bound.\n\nAdjustments:\n- No snow, no storm system, no advisories: push lower end.\n- Some freezing fog/black ice risk, plus Michigan sometimes reacts to surprise fog → nudge up slightly from pure historical minimums.\n- No neighboring closures, no strong buzz → no upward community adjustment.\n\nRounded competitive forecast: 6% snow-day probability.\nThis is slightly conservative (above the ~3% raw blend) to account for unmodeled last-minute issues (e.g., a denser-than-forecast fog bank exactly at bus time).\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\nYou’d likely be wrong (i.e., an actual closure happens) only if:\n- A stronger-than-forecast freezing fog/black ice event develops over a wide area right before the morning commute, dropping visibility to near zero and glazing many roads suddenly; or\n- A late-developing band of lake-effect or clipper snow sets up over Rockford overnight, adding several inches with bad timing that are *not* in the current guidance; or\n- There is a non-weather operational issue (power outage, heating failure, large accident closing key routes) coinciding with the morning.\n\nGiven current data and expert consensus, those are low-probability edge cases consistent with a single-digit risk.\n\n7. COMPETITION / BRIER SCORE STRATEGY\n- The environment is strongly signaling “school open.”\n- Using a very low but non-zero probability (6%) balances decisiveness with the reality that closures are never literally impossible.\n- Avoiding the 40–60% middle ground is appropriate here because experts are not split; all four align on low risk.\n\nFinal call: ~6% chance of a snow day (closure or full weather-related cancellation) on Monday, January 5, 2026 in Rockford, MI. Expect school to open on time with routine winter precautions.",
