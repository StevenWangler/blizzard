  "primary_factors": [
    "Negligible new snowfall expected (near 0\" total); no strong ice-storm/freezing-rain signal",
    "Primary hazard is early-morning (roughly 5–7 AM) blowing snow/brief wintry burst + drifting causing patchy slick spots, especially on residential/secondary roads",
    "Wind chill is cold but *authoritative NWS Rockford point forecast* does NOT support ≤ -20°F (so no near-automatic cold closure trigger)",
    "Plow timing is tight: precip/drifting window ends close to bus rollout, leaving arterials passable but many neighborhood streets still inconsistent by ~6:30 AM",
    "No confirmed Tuesday-morning neighboring-district closures yet; community/social buzz is minimal",
    "Power outages are negligible (county-level ~1 customer out); not a driver"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: (a) this is NOT a high-snowfall day; (b) the main operational risk is the pre-dawn/early-morning window with patchy slick travel and reduced visibility; (c) cold wind chills are a concern but power outages are not.\n2) Disagreements: wind chill severity. One Weather.com variant showed -23°F to -24°F (closure trigger), but the Web Weather Verifier confirmed an authoritative NWS Rockford-specific MapClick forecast stating Tuesday wind chills only as low as about -2°F (and tonight as low as -5°F). That contradiction pushes me to *downweight* the extreme Weather.com value as a page/variant mismatch.\n3) Plow timing math: the infrastructure monitor places the main burst ~05:00–06:00 with only ~0.5–1.5 hours before ~06:30 bus rollout; arterials likely passable but not clean, and local streets likely still partly snow-covered. This supports delay risk more than full closure.\n4) Ice: safety flags “moderate” ice risk, but there is no clear new freezing-rain/glaze signal—more consistent with refreeze/packed-snow/bridge-deck slickness. That typically elevates delay risk, not automatic closure.\n5) Neighboring districts: news intel found NO verified Tue 1/27 closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts at this time; only general media hints that Tuesday is the best chance. Therefore no +15–20% domino adjustment.\n6) Power outages: confirmed negligible (Kent County ~1 customer affected); no adjustment.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS Rockford point forecast contradicts ≤ -20°F; therefore I do NOT apply the near-automatic cold closure rule.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) if wind chills actually verify ≤ -20°F in Rockford 6–8 AM (or an updated NWS product flips colder); (b) if a narrow lake-effect band produces a quick coating and widespread near-zero visibility right at bus time; (c) if neighboring districts begin closing in a cluster overnight.\n\nWeighting (per directive):\n- Meteorology (25%): low snow totals + short-lived burst → closure unlikely.\n- Safety (20%): moderate risk with tight morning window → pushes up modestly.\n- History (15%): similar patterns usually open or delay → modest.\n- News (15%): no confirmed closures/buzz → keeps probability from rising.\n- Infrastructure (10%): local streets behind by 6:30 → supports some closure risk but more delay.\n- Power (10%): no outages → no bump.\n- Web verifier (5%): resolves cold-trigger conflict toward NWS → prevents big increase.\n\nResult: **23%** for a full Rockford snow day (closure). I would rate a **2-hour delay** as the most likely operational outcome if conditions verify as forecast.",
