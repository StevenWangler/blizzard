  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree snowfall is minor and not the driver; the real hazards are (a) extreme wind chills during the commute and (b) a short overnight icing/refreeze risk. Also agree visibility is mainly an overnight issue and is generally better during 06:00–09:00.\n2) Disagreement: The extent of icing/glazing and how much to weight “domino” signals. Meteorology says glaze should be thin/spotty; safety flags high ice-formation risk on untreated surfaces. News intel confirms one neighboring closure (Kenowa Hills) but not widespread confirmed Friday calls yet.\n3) Plow timing math: If wintry mix ends ~04:00, there are ~3 hours 40 minutes until a 07:40 start. Safety notes that’s typically sufficient for primary corridors but not guaranteed for subdivisions/secondary/rural segments—where Rockford bus routes can be sensitive.\n4) Any ice? Yes: brief freezing rain around ~00:00 with rapid refreeze. Even if light/patchy, with temps plunging well below 0°F it becomes “hard ice” risk on bridges/overpasses and untreated roads.\n5) Neighboring districts: FOX17 closings feed lists Kenowa Hills CLOSED for Fri 1/23; Forest Hills shows “No evening activities” (not a full closure). Rockford/GRPS/Northview/Comstock Park not confirmed closed yet in accessible snapshots.\n6) What would make me wrong? (i) If icing is more widespread than expected on secondary roads, closure odds jump. (ii) If Rockford adopts a strict wind-chill exposure policy (or can’t reliably run buses/buildings in -25 to -30°F wind chills), closure odds also jump. (iii) Conversely, if crews pre-treat effectively and most bus routes stay on treated arterials, a normal open (or just a delay) is more likely.\n\nWeighting the four expert domains per directive: Meteorology (30%) argues against closure due to low snow and no precip after ~04:00 but acknowledges refreeze + extreme cold. Safety (20%) supports a delay/mitigation approach with moderate closure risk, emphasizing secondaries and exposure. History (15%) suggests this pattern more often yields delays than full closures unless icing becomes significant; historical closure rates cluster ~0.30–0.45 depending on glaze. News intel (15%) adds real-world signal: at least one nearby district (Kenowa Hills) is already listed closed for Friday—this meaningfully elevates risk but is not yet “3+ neighboring districts closed,” so it’s a smaller bump than the full +15–20% adjustment.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds: snow totals (<1\") alone would normally be 5–15%, but ice + wind chills near/at the ≤-20°F critical zone is a major escalation. With wind chill projected around -25 to -30°F during bus time, the closure probability rises into the “watch closely” band; however, because visibility is forecast good at commute time and the icing signal appears light/patchy with several hours for treatment, the most likely operational outcome is a DELAY rather than a full closure. I therefore place full snow-day (closure) probability at 47% (leaning slightly below 50, but elevated).",
