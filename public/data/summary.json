  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Light to occasionally moderate lake-effect snow, ~0.6\" new snow Monday, temps well below freezing, **no ice**, winds 10–20 mph, visibility 1–3 miles; calls this a **manageable school day** in typical Michigan terms.\n- Historian: Similar patterns in West Michigan almost always mean school is open; historical snow-day rates ~5–15% for this setup. Conditions are cold and snowy but typical for January.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads will be **slick and hazardous** for the 3–10 AM window, with compacted snow and some ice-like hard pack, poorer on secondary/rural roads and sidewalks.\n- News/Intel: Confirms ongoing wintry pattern but nothing extraordinary or blizzard-like focused on Monday.\n\nShared conclusions:\n- Cold, ongoing snow, and slick travel are expected.\n- Snow totals for Monday alone are modest (<1\").\n- This is a challenging but **not extreme** winter day by Michigan standards.\n- There is **no classic high-snow or ice-storm signal** that would by itself force widespread emergency closures.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist & Historian vs. Safety Analyst:\n  - Meteorologist and Historian both lean toward: \"This is a tough but normal school day; likely open if it were a regular day.\"\n  - Safety Analyst rates **risk as high** with “severe” morning commute impact, emphasizing cumulative snow, cold, and road slickness.\n- News/Intel introduces a crucial factor **outside weather**: Rockford is **already scheduled to be closed** for MLK Day/PD, and neighboring districts also treat it as a planned no-school day.\n\nReconciliation:\n- For a pure weather-based snow-day prediction, I’d weight:\n  - Meteorology (35%) + History (20%) → strong pull toward a low closure probability (maybe ~10–20%).\n  - Safety (25%) → upward pressure due to legitimately rough early-morning travel, maybe into the 20–30% range **if school were actually in session**.\n  - News/Intel (20%) → completely changes the problem: the district has already decided there is **no school for non-weather reasons**.\n\nBecause the competition question is, effectively, \"Will students have school or not on Jan 19?\", the scheduled holiday/PD closure dominates. That leads to a very high effective \"snow day\" probability even though the meteorology alone would not warrant a classic snow day.\n\n3) What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Safety timeline: Worst conditions 3:00–10:00 AM Monday.\n- Meteorologist: Snow is **ongoing** through the early morning with modest rates (≈0.05–0.1\"/hr), with a heavier burst around 7 AM.\n- That means there is **no clear “end of snow” window before the traditional start of school**. Plows can and will work overnight, but:\n  - They are plowing during active snowfall.\n  - Blowing and drifting can partially re-cover lanes between passes.\n- Effective plow timing to a typical high school first bell (~7:40 AM):\n  - Snow does **not** really stop beforehand; instead, there are 0 hours of clean, dry time between snow ending and the main commute.\n  - Primary routes likely remain passable but snow-covered; secondary/rural routes stay marginal.\n\nIf school were in session, this unclear plow window plus a heavier burst near 7 AM would strengthen the case for at least a **delay** from an operations standpoint, even though totals are small.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorologist: explicitly **no ice signal**; temps below freezing all day, all snow.\n- Historian: no mixed-precip events flagged; just snow and cold.\n- Safety Analyst: flags “ice_formation_risk: high” but clarifies it as **compacted snow polishing into hard-pack/ice** at trouble spots, not a freezing-rain glaze event.\n\nConclusion: **No classic ice storm or freezing rain.** The ice risk is from compressed snow and very cold, untreated surfaces, which is serious but much more localized and manageable than a regional ice event.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News/Intel: Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) also show **Jan 19 as a planned MLK/PD no-school day**, not as a weather-driven closure.\n- There are **no separate, storm-triggered closure alerts** for that Monday.\n\nUnder the competition rules, if this were purely a weather day and 3+ neighbors closed **for weather**, we’d add +15–20% to the snow-day probability. Here, they’re closed (or off) for the holiday, not snow, so this is **not** a weather-based bump. Instead, it reinforces that the entire region simply doesn’t have school scheduled that day.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Key ways this prediction could fail:\n  - The district unexpectedly decides to **convert the PD day into a remote-learning or make-up instructional day** and then keeps it open despite weather. (No evidence for this in the intel.)\n  - Forecasts are badly wrong and Monday turns into a **major, headline-grabbing blizzard or ice storm**, forcing additional emergency declarations. Current meteorology and NWS products do not support that.\n  - A late-breaking change where Rockford cancels the PD activities while still labeling the day a “closure” for some other reason; this wouldn’t change the outcome (still no students in school) but would change the closure rationale.\n\nGiven multiple official district communications and regional calendar norms, these failure modes are low probability.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates **low weather-driven closure need**; if Monday were a regular school day, I’d infer roughly a 10–20% chance of a snow day on weather alone. This pulls probability down in a pure-weather framing.\n- Safety (25%): Points to **high morning commute risk** and could justify stronger action (delay or closure) if students were expected to travel, nudging a pure-weather probability upward into the ~20–30% range.\n- History (20%): Strongly supports normal operations for this level of snow/cold; that drags a weather-only closure probability back down, probably closer to ~10–15%.\n- News/Intel (20%): Overrules the operational question by confirming the day is **already designated no-school/PD**. For the competition’s practical outcome (are students in school or not?), this pushes the final effective probability very high.\n\nSYNTHESIZED DECISION\n- Pure weather-based snow day probability (if Jan 19 were a standard school day): approximately **15%**, with most scenarios leaving school open, perhaps with minor delays or slow commutes.\n- Actual effective probability that **students do not attend school** on Jan 19 (the relevant outcome): **near certain**, because the district has officially published \"No School - MLK Day - All Staff PD\" well in advance.\n\nTo keep a good Brier score, I avoid 100% unless absolutely impossible to overturn. While it’s theoretically possible for the district to reverse course, the chance is extremely low. Balancing decisiveness with that tiny residual uncertainty, I set:\n- Final snow day / no-school probability: **95%**.\n\nThis reflects: (a) a scheduled, highly confident non-attendance decision, (b) modest but non-trivial weather challenges that would not alone guarantee a snow day, and (c) a very small residual chance of some unforeseen policy shift.\n",
