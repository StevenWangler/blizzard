  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, no accumulating snow, no precipitation overnight or during school hours, decent visibility, routine winter day.\n- Historian: This pattern (cold, quiet, post-light-snow) almost never produces closures; historical snow-day rate ~2–5% in similar setups.\n- Safety analyst: Road and travel risk is low. Primary roads (9/10), secondary (8/10), parking lots (8/10). Morning and afternoon commute impacts rated minimal.\n- News intel: No active snow-day decision because Jan 2 is already part of winter break; no regional closure chatter or weather emergencies.\n\nAll four converge on: routine winter conditions with low operational risk and no serious weather hazard.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There are no substantive conflicts. The only slight tension is:\n  - Safety notes a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in isolated spots (shaded/low-traffic areas).\n  - Meteorology emphasizes no new precip and typical cold.\nThese are compatible: patchy slick spots are possible, but not enough to justify a closure.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Prior light snow/freezing drizzle occurred on Jan 1, not overnight on Jan 2.\n- Meteorological summary: 0\" precip/snow from midnight through 11 PM Jan 2.\n- Safety analyst assumes no additional overnight snow and that Michigan plows will have cleared routes well before the 6–8 AM commute.\n- Effective plow window: at least several overnight hours with no new snow leading up to ~7:40 AM bus times.\nResult: ample time for plowing/salting; timing favors normal operations.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice?\n- No new freezing rain or drizzle is forecast.\n- Temperatures stay below freezing, so any residual moisture can refreeze, especially on low-traffic/shaded spots.\n- Safety labels ice risk as \"moderate\" in these limited areas, not widespread black-ice conditions.\nConclusion: Some patchy slickness but no significant, system-wide ice event. This does not trigger the high-risk/closure thresholds.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel finds Grand Rapids Public Schools and other area districts list Jan 2, 2026 as part of winter break, not as a weather-related closure.\n- No explicit snow-day announcements for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD.\n- Importantly, these are scheduled no-school days, not reactive closures. Therefore, the snow-day probability should NOT be adjusted upward using the 3+ neighboring closures rule; they are calendar choices, not weather responses.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Underestimation scenarios (actual closure > prediction):\n  - An unforeseen overnight ice event (e.g., mist/drizzle not in current guidance) causing widespread black ice by early morning.\n  - An operational issue unrelated to forecasted weather (e.g., major bus fleet problem, large power outage, building issue) leading to a closure that is not weather-driven.\n- Overestimation scenarios (predicting higher closure odds than reality):\n  - Over-reacting to the word \"ice\" despite it being only a localized refreeze risk; that would inflate probability beyond what history and conditions support.\n\nGiven the strong agreement among experts and absence of any storm signal, the main way to be wrong would be an operational or surprise ice issue not supported by current data. That supports a very low, but non-zero, probability.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Forecast shows 0\" new snow, no precip, subfreezing but not extreme temps, light winds, and good visibility. This strongly pulls the estimate toward the 5–15% Michigan baseline for <4\" events, and actually below that because there is no event at all.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk rating, minimal commute impact, and clear guidance that normal schedules are appropriate. This reinforces a low closure probability.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs with nearly identical conditions show ~2–5% closure rates. This statistically anchors the probability near the very low end.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Secret weapon here: confirms Jan 2 is an already planned winter-break day for Rockford and many neighbors, so no real-time snow-day decision exists. There is no community buzz or neighboring weather closures to push the probability upward.\n\nAPPLICATION OF MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- <4\" snow typically → 5–15% snow-day chance.\n- In this case: 0\" new snow, no storm, no ice storm, and no blizzard.\n- No extreme cold (wind chills in teens, vs. closure thresholds near -15°F).\n- No active NWS advisories or warnings.\nGiven that this is effectively a non-event weather-wise, the true weather-driven closure probability is at or below the bottom of the 5–15% band.\n\nADJUSTMENTS FOR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Neighboring districts are closed, but for scheduled winter break, not weather. Per the rules, the +15–20% bump applies only when neighbors close due to weather. That does NOT apply here.\n- Community sentiment: \"no_buzz\" — people are not even discussing a snow day, consistent with both the calendar break and lack of severe weather.\n- Therefore, no upward adjustment is made from neighboring behavior or sentiment.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY & CONFIDENCE\n- Baseline from history and meteorology: ~2–5%.\n- Safety: supports staying at the bottom of that range.\n- News intel: confirms there is effectively no active snow-day decision on this date.\n\nI set the snow-day probability at 5%:\n- This reflects a small allowance for unforeseen localized ice or operational issues, but respects the near-unanimous expert signal that a weather-based closure would be very unlikely if this were a regular school day.\n- Confidence is HIGH because all four experts are aligned and there are no conflicting indicators.\n\nNote: In practice, Rockford is already closed for winter break on Jan 2, 2026. This probability quantifies the chance of a *weather-driven* closure if school had been scheduled, not the certainty of closure due to the academic calendar.",
