  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear, dry, cold setup. 0.0\" snow, 0% precip overnight, modest winds, visibility generally fine. Explicit conclusion: very unlikely to trigger a snow day; normal operations expected.\n- Safety (25% weight): Roads scored 8–9/10, risk level \"low,\" morning and afternoon commute impact \"minimal.\" Safety recommendations explicitly support a normal start time with only standard cold-weather precautions.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs for similar cold, dry early-December days show 1–3% snow day rates. Seasonally typical pattern, with no storm, no ice, and wind chills above common closure thresholds.\n- News/Community (20% weight): No official Rockford or neighboring district (e.g., Forest Hills) closure hints, no region-wide closure headlines, no social-media buzz, and no event cancellations tied to Dec. 8. All signals consistent with routine school day.\nAll four experts independently point to normal operations. There are no material conflicts to resolve: everyone agrees that conditions are cold but quiet and well within Michigan norms.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- No new snow is forecast between Sunday evening and Monday morning, so traditional “how many hours from snow ending to first bell?” math is essentially moot.\n- Safety analysis defines the worst conditions window as 00:00–08:00 on 12/08 with only minimal impact, associated with cold and possible refreeze of residual moisture rather than active snowfall.\n- With bare/dry or previously treated pavement and no accumulation, the need for overnight plowing is low; any maintenance (salting spot ice, checking trouble spots) can be easily completed before the ~7:40 AM start window.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Meteorology: 24 hours below freezing, but no new liquid precip. Any ice risk is from refreeze, not from an ice storm.\n- Safety: \"ice_formation_risk\": moderate, specified as isolated black ice on bridges, overpasses, and shaded/untreated side streets. Driving and walking scores (7–8/10) reflect that this is a manageable, routine risk, not a disruptive glaze event.\n- No freezing rain in the forecast, no mention of widespread glaze or power outages. This is classic Michigan \"watch for black ice\" weather, not closure-grade ice.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior and community expectations\n- Neighboring districts like Forest Hills show no closure or delay notices for early December 2025 and only generic \"how we communicate closures\" guidance.\n- Kent ISD and local media lists do not show region-wide closure chatter for Dec. 8.\n- Social media sentiment: \"no_buzz\" – nobody is treating this as a storm day; no \"everyone thinks we’re off\" signal that would push admin behavior.\n- Per the weighting rules: we would add +15–20% if 3+ neighboring districts were closing or +10–15% if community strongly expected closure. Instead, there are zero closure signals and no expectations of a day off, so no upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis (with expert weights)\nBaseline, from historical patterns alone (20% weight):\n- Historical snow day rate for this pattern: ~2% (midpoint of 1–3%).\nMeteorology (35% weight):\n- Forecast points strongly to normal operations: assign ~2–4% closure odds. I take 3% to align with a clean \"no storm, no advisory\" setup.\nSafety (25% weight):\n- Explicitly recommends normal start; low risk. Assign ~2–3%; use 3% to stay conservative about black ice pockets.\nNews/Intel (20% weight):\n- No hints of planning for closure, no neighboring closures, no buzz. Implies very low implicit closure probability, ~1–3%; use 2%.\nWeighted blend:\n- Meteorology: 0.35 * 3% = 1.05\n- Safety: 0.25 * 3% = 0.75\n- History: 0.20 * 2% = 0.40\n- News/Intel: 0.20 * 2% = 0.40\nTotal ≈ 2.6%, rounded to 3%.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Snow: 0\" new snow expected. This is below even the <4\" band (which itself only implies 5–15% odds). The Michigan threshold table is driven by storm magnitude and timing; we have no storm.\n- Cold: Wind chills near 0°F at worst, not below -15°F. Local practice, as noted by the historian, only cancels for extreme cold (roughly -15°F to -20°F or lower) or major storms. We’re far from that.\n- Ice/blizzard: No ice storm, no blizzard winds, no visibility collapse. So none of the 60–95% categories apply.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nTo be wrong (school closes or delays despite this forecast), one of the following would likely have to occur:\n- A surprise lake-effect band develops and drops several inches of snow specifically over northern Kent County overnight, creating rapidly deteriorating roads.\n- An unforecast freezing drizzle/light freezing rain event produces widespread glaze and black ice late Sunday night or pre-dawn Monday.\n- A major non-weather factor (e.g., large-scale power outage, facility emergency) coincidentally occurs overnight.\n- Overnight forecast revisions significantly increase storm or wind-chill severity (e.g., wind chills revised to < -20°F or a sudden advisory/warning issued) and the district decides on a short-fuse delay or closure.\nNone of these are present in current data, so they represent low-probability, unforeseen changes.\n\n8. Final call\nGiven unanimous expert agreement, strong historical base rates, and no opposing news/community signals, the snow day (or even delay) probability for Rockford, Michigan on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025 is best estimated at about 3%. That keeps us decisive and away from the 40–60% band, aligned with a competitive Brier Score strategy.\n\nOperationally, the correct expectation is a fully normal school day with standard winter caution for cold and spot ice, but no weather-related schedule changes.",
