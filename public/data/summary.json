  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs conflict:\n- Meteorology: Very quiet pattern for the Sunday-before/Monday-morning window. No accumulating snow (0.0\"), very low precip chances, light winds, only localized freezing fog pre‑dawn. Explicitly labels closure risk as very low.\n- Safety: Rates primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10, walking conditions 7/10, with a low overall risk level. Notes only patchy black ice potential at known trouble spots and recommends spot checks, not broad plowing/salting.\n- History: Analog patterns (cold, calm, no overnight accumulation) show 2–5% closure rates. Rockford historically stays open under exactly these conditions; closures are tied to heavy lake‑effect, ice storms, or extreme wind chills.\n- News/Community Intel: District calendar and updates clearly expect school to resume Jan 5 with no weather disclaimers. Neighboring districts show no closure announcements. Forecasts describe only light snow later Monday and a more notable event Tuesday, not Monday morning.\nAll four experts align on: no active storm for the Monday morning commute, roads largely manageable, and historically/operationally a normal school day. There are no substantive conflicts—only a minor nuance that safety flags a moderate ice formation risk in specific spots, but this is consistent with meteorology’s freezing fog note and history’s mention of occasional slick spots that do NOT typically cause closures.\n\n2. Plow timing math (hours from worst conditions to 7:40 AM start):\n- Worst conditions window (from safety): 2026-01-04T02:00 to 08:00 (freezing fog and any lingering light impacts), i.e., early Sunday.\n- No new accumulating snow or rain is forecast after that; Sunday daytime into Sunday night stays dry and calm.\n- Typical first bus/school start window for Rockford: around 6:30–7:40 AM Monday.\n- Effective time between end of notable conditions (08:00 Sunday) and the Monday morning bus window (≈06:30–07:40 Monday) is roughly 22–24 hours of quiet weather.\nThat is far more time than plow/salt crews need for this level of prior accumulation, especially with no additional overnight snow. Plow timing is clearly favorable for opening.\n\n3. Ice considerations:\n- Temps in the 20s overnight with freezing fog can allow thin black ice on bridges, overpasses, shaded curves, and some sidewalks/parking lots.\n- Safety labels ice formation risk as \"moderate\" in these localized areas, but not widespread glaze, sleet, or a freezing-rain event.\n- Meteorology explicitly notes no ice storm, and no additional liquid precip—just mist/fog and refreeze of existing moisture.\n- Historically, this pattern leads to standard caution advisories, not system-wide closures, in Rockford/Kent County.\nConclusion: There is some patchy ice risk that warrants early-morning spot checks and caution, but it does not reach the \"ice changes everything\" threshold (i.e., no storm-scale icing).\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community expectations:\n- News intelligence shows no weather-related closure postings for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD for Monday Jan 5.\n- Official Rockford communications very clearly describe Jan 5 as a normal return day, and there are no subtle hints (no banners, no \"monitor for updates\" language) that they are considering a change.\n- Social/media sentiment: \"uncertain\" but not strongly leaning toward closure; coverage treats this as ongoing, routine lake-effect with some slick roads, not a closure-level event.\nPer the weighting rules, the lack of neighboring closures and lack of community push for closing support keeping the probability on the low end and give no basis to apply the +15–20% or +10–15% upward adjustments.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis with expert weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Forecast strongly implies a standard school day, suggesting about a 5–10% closure risk given cold, dry, and calm conditions. I take 8% from this domain, near the upper end only because of patchy freezing fog/black ice.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low risk rating, good road scores, and minimal commute impact suggest ~5–10% closure probability. I assign 7% from safety.\n- History (20% weight): Analog rates are 2–5%. Given a slight nod to recent freezing rain earlier in the weekend, I use 4% from history.\n- News/Community Intel (20% weight): Signals a clear expectation of opening, no neighboring closures, and no chatter about a major storm—this domain points to roughly 5–10% odds. I use 8% here, mainly to reflect that unknowns can emerge but none are visible now.\nWeighted blend (rounded):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 * 8 ≈ 2.8\n- Safety: 0.25 * 7 ≈ 1.8\n- History: 0.20 * 4 ≈ 0.8\n- News/Intel: 0.20 * 8 ≈ 1.6\nSum ≈ 7.0 → final snow day probability = 7%.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds and why this is far below closure norms:\n- New snow: 0\"—way under even the lowest Michigan threshold (<4\" corresponds to just 5–15% closure odds, and that assumes it is falling into the commute, which it isn’t).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard criteria, no extreme cold (wind chills well above the -15°F guideline).\n- Multiple quiet hours (almost a full day) for road crews to work before school resumes.\n- No neighboring districts signaling closure and no strong community expectation of closing.\nTogether, these keep the event well below the 15% range and in the very-low-probability bracket. There is no credible path to the 40–60% zone without a major, currently unforecast change (e.g., surprise heavy lake-effect band overnight or a late-developing freezing-rain episode).\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes are:\n- A last-minute, unmodeled burst of snow or localized heavy lake-effect Sunday night into early Monday dropping several inches, specifically timed into the commute.\n- An unexpected patch of light freezing rain or drizzle Sunday night that produces widespread black ice (not just localized) by Monday morning.\n- A shift in district risk tolerance due to non-weather factors (e.g., staffing/transportation constraints) causing them to close on conditions that are normally considered manageable.\nCurrent data and patterns don’t support these scenarios, but they are the ways this 7% estimate could be too low.\n\nOverall judgment: All four expert domains point to a typical winter morning with some slick spots but no active storm. Historically and operationally, Rockford almost always opens under these conditions. A 7% closure probability reflects a small allowance for last-minute surprises while remaining consistent with the data and Michigan-specific tolerance levels.",
