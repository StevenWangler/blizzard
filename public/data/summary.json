  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: No accumulating snow, mainly rain with light sleet after ~15:00–17:00, temps 31–37°F, no freezing rain event, no blizzard-level wind or visibility issues.\n- History: Very strong alignment with past mid-January days in West Michigan that almost never close (historical snow-day rate ~1–3% for similar patterns).\n- Safety: Morning commute impact minimal; roads largely bare/wet. Main impacts are moderate rain/sleet and some slick spots during the afternoon/evening, not during morning bus times.\n- News/Community: No closure announcements, no neighboring district closures, no social media buzz, no power/outage/event disruptions.\nAll four agree there is no major snowstorm, no significant ice storm, and no extreme cold on the morning of Jan. 13.\n\n2. ANY DISAGREEMENTS?\n- The only slight tension: Safety flags a *moderate* ice-formation risk in spots (patchy black ice, slick surfaces) while meteorology emphasizes no organized freezing rain/ice storm. These are compatible: localized slick patches vs. system-wide ice.\n- No direct contradictions in timing, temperature, or precip type. Because the meteorological and historical signals are both very low risk, and safety still rates primary/secondary roads 7–8/10, I treat this as a minor nuance, not a conflict.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW/ICING END TO 7:40 AM)\n- There is effectively **no measurable snow** and no forecast period of steady freezing rain overnight.\n- Roads heading into the morning are described as overcast/misty and around 31–32°F but dry in terms of measurable precip.\n- Since there is nothing substantial to plow or treat beyond routine winter practice, the effective required plow window is near-zero. Crews are dealing with standard winter dampness, not clearing accumulated snow or glaze.\n- Therefore, the classic “plow timing” metric strongly favors *no closure*: there is simply no storm to clean up before the buses roll.\n\n4. ICE RISK ANALYSIS\n- Temps: near freezing overnight (around 31°F) but trending up after sunrise.\n- Precip timing: main liquid (rain with light sleet) comes **after** school has started, with worst from ~15:00–20:00.\n- Expert consensus: no freezing rain setup; any ice is from marginal temps and wet surfaces, not a dedicated ice storm.\n- Safety notes a *moderate* ice-formation risk for patchy black ice on bridges/untreated rural spots and some slick lots/sidewalks, especially late day.\n- Critically for closure decisions: there is **no indication of widespread, road-coating glaze** that would trigger 60–85%+ closure probabilities under the given Michigan thresholds.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Neighboring_district_closures: [] — there are **zero** known neighboring closures.\n- Rockford Public Schools website: shows Jan. 13 as a normal day with no weather contingency posted.\n- Regional media: current winter focus is on prior/northwest Michigan events, not Kent County on Jan. 13.\n- Social media/community: ‘no_buzz’ — the community is not treating this as a significant storm day.\nUnder the rules, neighboring closures could add +15–20% and strong closure expectations +10–15%. Here we have neither; if anything, the absence of buzz reinforces a low probability.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey failure modes:\n- **Unexpected temperature drop**: If temps fall a few degrees lower than forecast (e.g., to 27–28°F) while precip arrives earlier than expected, rain could become freezing rain or produce widespread ice by early morning. That would dramatically increase closure odds.\n- **Model miss on precip timing**: If the main rain/sleet band shifts into the 3–7 AM window with temps at or below 30°F, roads could glaze before plows and salt can respond, particularly on rural and secondary routes.\n- **Unforecast NWS advisories**: A late-issued Winter Weather Advisory or Ice Storm Warning specifically for Kent County focused on the bus window could force a different decision.\nAs of the 2026-01-12T18:14Z analysis, none of these are signaled in the data provided.\n\n7. WEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS\nFollowing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong signal of **no accumulating snow** and marginal temps → pushes probability toward 0–5%.\n- Safety (25%): Recognizes moderate localized slick risk but minimal morning commute impact and acceptable road scores (7–8/10) → supports a low but non-zero probability, perhaps ~5–10% on its own.\n- History (20%): Historical snow-day rates for this pattern are ~1–3%; seasonal adjustment is even negative (less likely than a typical January snow day) → nudges probability toward the very low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no buzz, no advisories, and normal calendar → strongly favors the low end of any forecast range.\nCombining: meteorology and history independently suggest ~2–4%; safety suggests a bit higher due to generic ice caution but focused on afternoon; news pulls back toward the low end. A balanced, Brier-score-minded synthesis is about **3%**.\n\n8. ALIGNMENT WITH MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- Snow: 0\" forecast → well below even the lowest 4\" threshold (which would only be 5–15%).\n- Ice: no clear freezing rain event, just marginal temps with rain/sleet mainly after school → does not reach the 8+ inches OR ice = 60–85% category.\n- Blizzard/extreme cold: not present.\nGiven these, the rational band is **0–5%**, and 3% best matches the combined expert evidence without being artificially absolute.\n\nConclusion: The evidence from all four expert domains overwhelmingly supports a **normal school day** with some caution for afternoon/evening wet and locally slick conditions, not a snow day closure.",
