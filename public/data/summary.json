  "decision_rationale": "This prediction is for FRIDAY, NOV 28 in Rockford, Michigan.\n\nMeteorology: Friday itself features light snow/freezing drizzle, around 1–2\" of additional snow, temps in the 20s to near 30°F, and generally decent visibility. The 11\" total and Winter Storm Watch are tied mainly to the Saturday–Sunday storm, not the Friday school window.\n\nMichigan thresholds: Less than 4\" of snow with routine winter conditions corresponds to about a 5–15% closure probability. Friday’s setup falls squarely into that category: no heavy rates, manageable visibility, and road crews well within normal capacity.\n\nHistorical patterns: Past events with a weaker Friday system followed by a stronger weekend storm show low closure rates on the advisory-type day, with closures more likely only when the heaviest snow coincides with a weekday morning commute. Here, the main storm peaks on Saturday, so direct school-day disruption is minimal.\n\nSafety: The safety assessment flags moderate risk: slick spots and some compacted snow/ice on side roads and lots, but primary roads remain mostly wet-to-slushy with effective plow/salt response. The expert explicitly notes that conditions do not strongly support a full snow day and that, at most, a short delay could be justified.\n\nSynthesis: Combining these, a full snow day for Friday is unlikely in a Michigan context. To stay calibrated and competitive on Brier score and avoid being overly conservative, I set the probability at 18%, at the high end of the <4\" guideline range but still clearly in the \"school open\" regime.",
