  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology: Quiet, dry, cold pattern. 0% snow chance, 0\" accumulation, no alerts. Roads expected to be dry aside from residual cold spots.\n- History: Near-identical past patterns in Rockford/West Michigan (cold, dry, no storm, no alerts) have essentially never produced snow days. Historical snow-day rate ~0%, confidence high.\n- Safety: Road, parking lot, and walking scores are 7–9/10 with only moderate refreeze risk on bridges and untreated spots. Travel risk is low, commute impacts minimal.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closures/delays posted; only generic winter reminders and a past midweek event (Dec 3) where buses shifted to paved roads. Community and media are not signaling a significant Monday hazard.\n\nAll four experts align: there is no active storm, no accumulating snow, and no extreme cold. None suggest a meaningful chance of a closure. There are no real conflicts to resolve—only very minor nuance about isolated ice risk on cold pavement.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Forecast shows no new snow or mixed precip overnight into Monday; plow timing is essentially a non-issue.\n- Any plow/salt work is routine maintenance from prior days, not storm response.\n- Time from last meaningful falling precip (none in the 24 hours before school) to a 7:40 AM start is effectively many hours of dry, cold conditions. Crews are not behind; infrastructure is not stressed.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Temperatures remain below freezing, so any existing damp spots can refreeze.\n- Safety analysis flags only a *moderate* ice-formation risk limited to bridges, shaded curves, and untreated surfaces.\n- There is **no freezing rain or new precipitation** forecast; this is residual, spotty slickness, which Michigan districts handle with routine caution, not closures.\n- Therefore, we do *not* treat this like an ice event under the decision thresholds. It’s ordinary winter refreeze, not a systemic hazard.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior (secret weapon weighting)\n- News Intel explicitly notes: no neighboring Kent County districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have posted closures or delays for Monday.\n- No cascade of Sunday/Monday event cancellations is evident.\n- Under the rules, 3+ neighboring closures would add +15–20% to the probability. Here we have **zero** closures, so there is **no upward adjustment**—if anything, it reinforces the baseline near-zero call.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35%): Dry, cold, quiet. This alone points to ~0–2% closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk; roads in good shape; morning and afternoon commute impacts minimal. Suggests near-normal operations, ~0–3%.\n- History (20%): Analog events show a 0% snow-day rate; Rockford typically operates in harsher cold unless combined with snow/ice or much lower wind chills. Pulls probability down toward ~0–1%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no early hints, no strong community expectation of a Monday storm day. Reinforces the lower bound, ~0–3%.\n\nBlending these with the given Michigan thresholds:\n- There is **0\"** forecast snow, far below the <4\" band (which itself is only 5–15%).\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, and wind chills are above -15°F.\n- No cross-signal (no neighbors closing) to push the number upward.\n\nGiven the strong consensus and absence of any closure trigger, the calibrated probability that Rockford Public Schools cancels or delays for weather on Monday, Dec 8, 2025 is set to **1%** (effectively “open,” but leaving a tiny margin for unforeseen operational issues). This avoids an overconfident 0% while remaining decisively low for Brier-score purposes.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- An unexpected, un-forecast event: a surprise overnight burst of snow or freezing drizzle producing widespread ice.\n- A major non-weather operational issue (e.g., sudden heating failures, large water main break, or power outage unrelated to the current forecast).\n- A last-minute policy decision based on factors not visible in the current data (e.g., lingering issues from the Dec 3 conditions that aren’t publicly posted).\n\nGiven the data at the analysis timestamp, those scenarios are low probability, so the decision remains: extremely unlikely snow day, school almost certainly in session.",
