  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorology: Quiet, cold, and dry on Monday (0\" snow, 0% snow chance, no ice), light winds, good visibility. Explicitly labels snow-day risk as effectively 0%.\n- History: Very similar past patterns (cold, dry day after 1–3\" snow) yield snow-day rates of ~2–5%, with West Michigan districts almost always staying open unless heavy ongoing snow, ice, or dangerous cold is present.\n- Safety: Road risk rated low. Primary and secondary roads 9/10, parking lots 8.5/10, minimal commute impact, low overall risk. Recommends normal operations with attention to refreeze spots and sidewalks—no delay or closure warranted.\n- News/Community: No Rockford or neighboring district closures or delays announced. Community sentiment is general winter-storm awareness, not \"schools will be closed.\" No event cancellations tied to Monday.\nAll four point to school being open; there is no signal suggesting a closure.\n\n2. Points of disagreement\nThere are effectively no substantive conflicts:\n- Meteorology says no precip; Safety still flags a moderate *ice-formation risk* specifically from refreezing of residual moisture. These are compatible: no new precip, but cold temperatures can freeze leftover moisture on bridges/sidewalks.\n- Visibility analysis lists a modeled minimum visibility of 0 miles but then clarifies that is a model artifact and that operationally visibility should be typical (4–6+ miles). This is already internally resolved in the meteorological summary.\nNo cross-tool contradictions about timing, totals, or severity.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Sunday (Dec 7): Light to moderate snow with totals ~1–3\"; organized snow ends by late Sunday.\n- Monday (Dec 8): No new snow (0% chance) overnight or during commute.\n- That leaves well over 8–12 hours from snow end Sunday evening to the 7:40 AM Monday start bell, and several hours before the 6–8 AM bus window.\n- Safety notes that Sunday evening should be focused on clearing/widening, so by Monday morning operations are mainly about de-icing trouble spots.\nGiven this, plow/salt timing is more than sufficient for Michigan standards; main routes and most secondaries should be in good winter condition by morning.\n\n4. Ice risk\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, drizzle, or new precip; temps stay below freezing, so any meltwater can refreeze.\n- Safety: Ice-formation risk labeled \"moderate\" but framed as localized black ice potential on bridges, shaded curves, hills, parking lots, and sidewalks; not systemic glazing.\n- History: Similar post‑storm cold days with patchy ice almost never result in full district closures; at most, they sometimes warrant extra caution or a rare short delay when combined with active precip or worse cold, which we do not have here.\nConclusion: There is some localized ice risk, but not the kind of widespread, invisible ice event that drives high closure probabilities.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News intelligence explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD and found **no public announcements of closures or delays** for Monday.\n- No early, proactive closure chatter in official channels, which often appears when storms are truly disruptive.\nUnder the decision rules, 3+ neighboring closures would add 15–20 percentage points; here we have 0 neighboring closures, so **no upward adjustment** is applied.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe most realistic ways this 2% estimate could be wrong:\n- Forecast bust: An unexpected band of lake‑effect snow sets up late Sunday night into Monday morning over northern Kent County, dumping several inches during the bus window and sharply reducing visibility.\n- Undetected widespread ice: More melt Sunday afternoon than expected followed by a strong radiational freeze, leading to pervasive black ice on a large share of roads, parking lots, and sidewalks beyond what crews can treat by dawn.\n- Infrastructure or power issues: Localized power outages or heating failures not tied to weather severity could force building-specific closures.\nCurrent data do not point strongly to any of these, but they are the residual tail risks captured in the 2%.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear, dry, cold conditions with no new snow or ice are the dominant factor. This alone would imply ~0–3% closure probability, given Michigan’s higher tolerance.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low overall risk, high road scores, minimal commute impact; this strongly supports staying open and may add 1–2 percentage points for localized ice risk but still in the very low range.\n- History (20% weight): Direct analogs show ~2–5% snow-day rates. This anchors the prediction around the low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): No official or neighboring closures, and no strong community expectation of a snow day. This supports staying at the low end of historical probabilities instead of bumping them up.\n\nPutting it together:\n- Baseline from meteorology + Michigan thresholds: Essentially 0%, since there is **no Monday storm** and totals are below any closure threshold.\n- Historical analogs raise this slightly to acknowledge that 1–3\" the day before with cold refreeze can occasionally cause isolated issues: up to ~3–4%.\n- Safety, emphasizing manageable but real localized ice, keeps us from calling it absolutely 0%, supporting a rounded estimate of ~2–3%.\n- News/Intel confirms no neighboring or preemptive closures, so we choose the **low end** of that range to balance Brier score precision vs. realism.\n\nFinal decision: **2% snow-day probability** with **very high confidence** that Rockford Public Schools will be open on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025, under normal schedule, with standard winter cold precautions.",
