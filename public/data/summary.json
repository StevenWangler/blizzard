  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorology: Monday 1/19 has cold, wintry conditions with light additional snow (~0.6–0.8\"), gusty winds (15–20 mph), and subfreezing temps all day.\n- History: This pattern is a typical mid-January West Michigan lake-effect regime—advisory-level, not a major storm; schools usually remain open in similar conditions.\n- Safety: Roads will be slick, with significant morning-commute impact but conditions that Michigan systems can generally manage with plows and cautious driving.\n- News Intelligence: Monday is a non-instructional day for Rockford due to MLK Jr. Day; weather is not driving the closure.\n\nAll four agree the weather is wintry but not catastrophic, and that there is no *new* storm-level trigger that would force closures beyond existing plans.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist & Historian: Both lean toward a LOW chance of a *weather-based* snow day if school were in session.\n- Safety Analyst: Describes conditions as warranting caution, possibly consistent with a delay, but not specifically calling for closure.\n- News Intel: Effectively says the question of a snow day is moot—students are off for a scheduled holiday, independent of weather.\n\nThe only real tension is between “low weather-driven closure probability” (meteo/history/safety) and “closure is already 100% scheduled” (news). There is **no** conflict about the weather severity itself.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window per safety: 00:00–10:00 on 1/19.\n- Meteorology: Snow showers persist through the early commute (heaviest 4–9 AM) with lingering activity into late afternoon.\n- That means there is **no long gap** when snow fully stops before the 7:40 AM bell; instead, plows work *during* ongoing light to moderate snow.\n- Practically: crews have been plowing since the weekend, so primary routes will be passable but repeatedly re-covered between passes. Effective “clean window” is close to **0 hours** of no snow before first bell—consistent with slick, not catastrophic, conditions.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorology for Monday: precipitation type is snow; temps remain well below freezing; no new freezing-rain signal.\n- Historian: notes earlier *Sunday* light mixed precip in the broader pattern, but Monday is predominantly snow.\n- Safety: flags **high ice formation risk** from refreeze and ongoing cold, not from active ice storm. This is patchy/black ice on untreated surfaces, not glaze ice on trees/lines.\n\nConclusion: No major ice storm or accretion; ice risk comes from cold, compacted snow and refreeze—serious for traction but routine for Michigan and below “ice storm” closure criteria.\n\n(5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News Intel: Most Kent County neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) customarily close for MLK Jr. Day. The intelligence indicates they are **very likely scheduled off** as well.\n- Importantly: these are *planned* federal-holiday closures, not last-minute snow days.\n\nPer your rules, 3+ neighboring districts closed typically adds +15–20% to snow-day probability. Here, that criterion is satisfied in a technical sense (many neighbors closed), but the driver is the federal holiday, not weather.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- If the district calendar or news intel were incorrect and Rockford actually had a regular instructional day on Jan 19.\n- If a surprise, intense lake-effect band locked over Rockford produced several inches (6–8\"+) of rapid snow overnight with near-whiteout conditions at bus time.\n- If a late-developing ice event (freezing rain) occurred Monday, causing widespread glaze and power issues.\n- If wind chills dropped into the sustained -15°F to -20°F range district-wide, triggering extreme cold closures.\n\nGiven the current data, none of these higher-impact triggers are indicated.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Shows <1\" additional snow on Monday, advisory-level winds, occasional reduced visibility, and continuous subfreezing temps. Independently, this supports only about a **10–20%** chance of a *weather-based* closure if it were a school day.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates conditions as **moderate risk**—significant morning impact but within Michigan’s capabilities. Recommends extra caution, possibly delay-like impacts, not clear closure. Implies roughly **15–25%** weather-closure probability.\n- History (20% weight): Historical snow-day rates for similar patterns are **2–10%**, strongly pointing to school being in session in a normal year.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, but functionally decisive): Confirms Rockford is **already officially closed** for MLK Day and that neighbors are also off. This turns the operational probability of “no school on Jan 19” for students into essentially **100%**, but for *non-weather* reasons.\n\nCombining the first three (weather-only lens) yields a low closure probability (on the order of 10–20%), consistent with Michigan thresholds: <4\" fresh snow, no blizzard, no major ice → 5–15% baseline. Safety concerns might nudge that into the low 20s at most.\n\nHowever, the News Intelligence layer overrides the decision context: the district has already chosen to close for a holiday. For the student-outcome question, the relevant probability is: “Will students have school on Monday?” That is overwhelmingly **no**, with closure already scheduled.\n\n3. APPLYING MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS & ADJUSTMENTS\n- New snow <1\" → baseline 5–15% for a *snow day* if school were in session.\n- No ice storm, no 8+\" event, no blizzard → no jump into 60–85% or 80–95% ranges.\n- 3+ neighboring districts closed → normally +15–20%, but here, those closures are due to the MLK holiday, not weather.\n\nTo honor both the weather logic and the real-world outcome:\n- Weather-based closure probability for this pattern, if Jan 19 were a regular school day: around **15%** (consistent with meteo/history/safety and thresholds).\n- Actual probability that students do **not** have school on Jan 19 (holiday + any weather noise): effectively **~100%**.\n\nFor the competition framing (Brier score), the operational question is “Will there be school?” Given multi-source official documentation, the best calibrated forecast is to treat this as a **near-certainty of no school**, while keeping a small allowance for the possibility of an administrative/calendar error or last-minute schedule change.\n\nThus I set the final **snow_day_probability = 95%** (very high but not absolute), reflecting: \n- 80–85 percentage points from the *pre-scheduled MLK closure* and widespread neighbor closure norms.\n- A minor upward nudge (≈+5–10 points) from the fact that, even if school were scheduled, conditions are at least marginally supportive of delays or heightened caution.\n\n4. WHY AVOID THE 40–60% RANGE\nExpert consensus on weather severity is fairly tight—light additional snow, advisory-level conditions, no major ice, no extreme cold. There is no genuine, high-conflict uncertainty between experts. The only point of tension is semantic (weather snow day vs. pre-planned holiday). That justifies a decisive posture (very high probability of no school) rather than a hedged mid-range forecast.\n\nIn summary: for Rockford students, Monday is effectively a snow day in outcome (no school), but the *cause* is calendar/holiday, not meteorological extremity.\n",
