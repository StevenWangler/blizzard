  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorologist: Cold, quiet pattern. No new accumulating snow, light winds, patchy freezing fog. Roads mostly dry/treated; only isolated slick spots. Explicitly notes conditions are very unlikely to justify a snow day.\n- Historian: Very similar past patterns (cold, dry, maybe some refreeze/patchy ice) have produced snow days only about 2–5% of the time. Rockford usually stays open unless there is 8–10\"+ snow, active ice storm, blizzard, or extreme wind chill well below -15°F.\n- Safety analyst: Risk level \"low\". Morning and afternoon commute impacts both rated minimal. Primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 7/10. Recommends standard start time; no justification for delay or closure.\n- News intel: No storm headlines, no travel advisories beyond routine winter caution, no power issues, no advance closure chatter or neighboring-district moves, no community assumption of a snow day.\nAll four agree this is a routine cold winter day with only minor slick-spot risk and no major weather driver for closing.\n\n2. Any conflicts?\n- Minor nuance: Meteorology mentions some freezing fog and potential slick patches; safety flags \"moderate\" ice-formation risk but still scores roads high and calls overall risk low. This is a difference in wording, not in bottom-line assessment.\n- No expert suggests significant snowfall, ice storm, blizzard conditions, or widespread dangerous wind chills. No one hints at a borderline call.\nGiven the strong alignment, there is no substantive conflict that requires tool-based clarification.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Snowfall: Forecast total for Sunday into Monday is 0.0\"; any snow from earlier (Friday) has had multiple cold, dry days and nights for plowing and treatment.\n- Active accumulation window: None during Sunday night into Monday morning.\n- Plow/road work: With no new snow and ample prior time since the last light event, county and city crews can have main routes and bus corridors in very good shape well before the morning commute.\n- Time from end of meaningful precipitation to first bell (≈7:40 AM): Effectively many hours to multiple days; there is no overnight accumulation that compresses plow timing.\nConclusion: Plow timing is extremely favorable; road readiness is not a limiting factor at all.\n\n4. Any ice?\n- Meteorology: Mentions mist and freezing fog late Sunday night with visibility drops in spots; potential for slick patches on untreated roads and lots. No freezing rain signal, no accreting ice, no glaze type ice storm.\n- Safety: Labels ice-formation risk as \"moderate\" but in a context of otherwise dry, frozen pavement. Primary/secondary roads remain high-scoring, with caution mainly on untreated side streets, bridges, and parking lots.\n- Historian: Notes this type of freezing-fog/patchy black ice setup is familiar and usually handled by standard salting rather than district-wide closures.\n- News intel: No freezing-rain or ice-storm headlines from NWS or media, no utility or road-agency alerts suggesting widespread icing.\nConclusion: There may be localized black ice and slick bus stop/sidewalk spots, but there is no systemic ice storm or widespread glazing that would drive closures in Michigan. It is a manageable risk, not a closure-level threat.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News intel: Checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD. None have posted planned closures, delays, or even strong hints of schedule changes for Monday, Dec. 15.\n- TV station closing lists: No advance listings for Rockford or neighbors.\n- Communication tone: Forest Hills explicitly notes they expect school to run normally in the upcoming week despite some snow in the broader forecast.\nTherefore: 0 neighboring districts are closed or signaling likely closures. Per the decision rules, there is no positive adjustment from neighboring closures (+15–20%) to apply.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nMain routes to being wrong:\n- An unmodeled, intense lake-effect snow band develops late Sunday night squarely over northern Kent County, rapidly dropping several inches of snow between ~3–7 AM with high snowfall rates and sudden road deterioration.\n- A surprise freezing drizzle episode adds a thin glaze of ice on top of cold pavement, transforming otherwise good roads and parking lots into hazardous surfaces right during the bus/parent commute.\n- A colder/windier-than-forecast pocket pushes wind chills well below typical thresholds (e.g., sustained -20°F or lower during bus times) and administrators decide to close or delay mostly for cold exposure.\n- A late-breaking infrastructure issue (widespread power or heating problems) emerges Sunday night that is unrelated to the current forecast.\nNone of these are indicated in the provided analyses as of Dec. 12; they remain low-probability tail risks.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates 0\" new snow, quiet high-pressure pattern, modest winds, and only localized freezing fog issues. This heavily caps the closure probability under Michigan thresholds.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, minimal commute impacts, high road scores, explicit statement that there is no justification for delay or closure. This supports a very low probability and reduces any temptation to overreact to the word \"ice\" in isolation.\n- History (20%): Analog events produce snow days about 2–5% of the time. This anchors the probability in that single-digit range and confirms that staying open is the norm in these conditions.\n- News intelligence (20%): Secret weapon indicates:\n  • No major storm narrative in media.\n  • No district or neighboring-district closure chatter.\n  • No special travel, utility, or event-cancellation warnings for Monday.\n  • Community sentiment is \"routine winter,\" not \"we all know school will be closed.\"\n  Under the provided adjustment rules, there is no reason to increase the baseline probability (no neighboring closures, no strong community expectation of closure, and some implicit sense that people see this as nothing beyond standard winter).\n\nQUANTITATIVE DECISION\n- Michigan closure thresholds from the prompt:\n  • <4\" snow → 5–15% (routine)\n  • 4–6\" → 15–35%\n  • 8\"+ or ice storm → 60–85%\n  • Blizzard/ice storm → 80–95%\n- Here: Forecast accumulation is 0\"; there is no storm, only cold and patchy slick spots. Historically similar days show ~2–5% closure rates.\n- Starting from historical 3–5% and cross-checking with current forecast and safety assessment, the rational range is around 2–6%, clearly below the 5–15% generic <4\" snow guideline because this is not even an active snowfall day.\n- To be competitive on Brier score, I should avoid an artificially inflated probability when all signals agree on “routine.” I therefore set the probability near the middle of the historical band but below generic thresholds: 4%.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nGiven:\n- No accumulating snow or ice storm,\n- Low safety risk and good road readiness,\n- Very low historical closure rate for this pattern,\n- No neighboring closures and no community expectation of a snow day,\nI recommend a NORMAL, ON‑TIME SCHOOL DAY for Rockford Public Schools on Monday, December 15, 2025.\n\nThis prediction: snow day probability = 4%, confidence = high (because all expert domains and real‑world signals are strongly aligned).",
