  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs disagreement\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • Meteorologist: Monday is cold, mostly dry, with no meaningful snow during the 6–9 AM commute and only ~0.6\" late‑evening snow. Ice storm/freezing rain is NOT a concern.\n  • Historian: This setup (prior‑day advisory snow, calmer/dry school day) historically yields very low snow‑day rates (~2–5%) in Rockford and West Michigan.\n  • Safety Analyst (after clarification): Morning risk is from refreeze and cold, not falling snow. Commute window risk is rated ~3–4/10 with minimal impact; primary roads expected in good winter shape.\n  • News Intel: No closures posted yet for Rockford or neighbors; community chatter is speculative but not strongly expecting shutdowns; guidance is to wait for early‑morning checks.\n  All four converge on: normal winter school day, with some slick spots but not closure‑level hazards.\n\n- INITIAL DISAGREEMENT & RESOLUTION:\n  • Original safety write‑up suggested “worst conditions 00:00–09:00 with moderate morning commute impact,” which looked inconsistent with meteorology (dry commute). I queried the safety analyst, who REVISED the timing: worst is now 2–7 AM due to cold/mist/refreeze, NOT active snow, and the commute impact is “minimal.” This now aligns with the meteorological guidance.\n  • No remaining substantive conflicts between experts after this correction.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Main storm and advisory impacts end by Sunday evening.\n- Advisory is explicitly noted as NOT extending into Monday; Monday daylight is mostly dry.\n- Plow/salt crews have: Sunday late afternoon + evening + overnight (roughly 12–16 hours) in mainly dry conditions before the 6–9 AM Monday commute.\n- Morning start time reference: about 7:40 AM bus/first bell. Snow effectively ENDS well before midnight Sunday, so there are ~7–10+ dry hours before that bell.\n- Safety analyst now rates primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 7.5/10. That’s consistent with successful overnight cleanup.\n- Conclusion: Plow timing is strongly favorable to having school; this is textbook \"storm the day before, clear overnight\" timing.\n\n3. Ice / freezing concerns\n- Meteorologist: No freezing rain signal; temperatures stay below freezing but dry during commute. Ice is specifically called “not a concern on Monday.”\n- Safety Analyst: Confirms no meaningful freezing drizzle signal; black ice risk only from routine refreeze of Sunday moisture on side streets, bridges, and parking lots.\n- Historian: Michigan closures in this region are usually driven by active ice storms or heavy banding during the commute—neither is present.\n- Conclusion: There is NO ice storm or freezing‑rain event. Only normal refreeze patches, which Michigan districts manage routinely with salting and caution.\n\n4. Neighboring districts / community signal\n- News Intel:\n  • No posted closures or delays yet for Rockford or nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Northview, Kenowa Hills, GRPS, etc.) as of late Sunday night/early Monday.\n  • Kent ISD has no region‑wide closure announcement.\n  • Sunday church/event closures were high, but those were about the weekend peak, not Monday.\n  • Social media: people are waiting for early‑morning alerts; no strong, unified expectation that \"everything will be closed.\" This is a neutral/uncertain, NOT a closure‑demanding, sentiment.\n- Per your rules: \n  • 3+ neighboring district closures → +15–20% probability bump. We have ZERO confirmed closures, so no upward adjustment.\n  • Community is not strongly saying \"this is nothing\" either; sentiment is mixed/wait‑and‑see. So I don’t apply a strong downward community adjustment, but I also do NOT add the +10–15% “everyone expects closure” bump.\n\n5. Michigan thresholds vs this event\n- New snow for Monday: ~0.6\" total, with NONE during commute/school day. This is well under the <4\" category, which your Michigan‑specific guidance says corresponds to 5–15% closure probability.\n- Total weekend snow: 6–12\" in the broader region, but that fell before Monday and is being cleaned up with a long dry window. Michigan districts handle this routinely when timing is favorable.\n- No blizzard conditions Monday: winds under 10 mph, no blowing/drifting during school.\n- No extreme cold: lows teens, wind chills in single digits/low teens—far from -15°F or lower.\n- No ice storm.\n- Historical analogs: 2–5% closure rate on such follow‑up days.\n\n6. Weighting of experts (per your percentages)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors school open. I translate this to a baseline closure probability around 5–8% (because conditions are routine and dry during commute).\n- Safety (25%): After correction, they explicitly say there is no basis for a snow day solely on road conditions; commute risk 3–4/10. That supports staying in the low single‑digit to low‑teens range.\n- History (20%): Similar setups close ~2–5% of the time. This strongly pulls the probability DOWN from any mid‑range guess.\n- News Intel (20%): No neighboring closures and only neutral community expectation → I do NOT apply any +15–20% bump; if anything, this slightly nudges probability DOWN because there is no early closure wave.\n\nCombining these:\n- Start from historical 2–5% and meteorological 5–8% → central tendency ~5–6%.\n- Safety analyst’s modest concern for patchy black ice and cold bus stops justifies nudging slightly UP, since an ultra‑cautious superintendent might close in a worst‑case localized scenario → up to about ~7%.\n- News intel gives no reason to nudge upward (no closures) and no strong reason to nudge way down (people did experience a hard weekend storm). Net effect ~0.\n\nFinal calibrated probability: 7% snow‑day chance.\nThis stays inside your 5–15% bracket for sub‑4\" events and matches both history and current conditions. It’s decisively low, not wishy‑washy in the 40–60% middle.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside (higher closure chance than I’m predicting):\n  • Overnight temperatures run colder than forecast AND plow/salt coverage underperforms, leading to widespread untreated ice on rural/secondary roads.\n  • A locally intense lake‑effect band unexpectedly redevelops over northern Kent County before 5–7 AM, dropping a quick additional 2–4\" with low visibility during the bus run.\n  • An unforecast patch of freezing drizzle produces a glaze on roads and sidewalks in the early‑morning hours.\n  • A cluster of neighboring districts, after 4:30–5:30 AM road checks, find conditions are worse than modeled and close en masse, pressuring Rockford to follow.\n\n- Downside (schools more certainly open than even 7% suggests):\n  • Crews over‑perform: roads and lots are almost completely bare and dry by 6 AM and bus test‑drives find only minor slick spots.\n  • Community and district leadership strongly prioritize returning from holiday break unless conditions are very clearly unsafe, making them less likely to close for routine winter hazards.\n\nGiven all available data and expert cross‑checks, the low‑single‑digit to low‑teens range is appropriate, and 7% best balances the small but non‑zero tail risks against overwhelmingly routine conditions.",
