  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clearly indicates **no new snow or ice** for Rockford overnight into Thursday, with good visibility and breezy but not severe winds. Rockford is *near but outside* the main advisory focus. Meteorologist explicitly states the risk of a snow day is **very low**.\n- History (20% weight): Analogue patterns—post-lake-effect, cold, mostly dry mornings—show **~5–10% historical snow day rate** for Rockford-like inland districts. Context emphasizes that Michigan districts routinely stay open in exactly these conditions.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates roads and travel conditions as **low risk** with minimal morning and afternoon commute impact, assuming standard plow/salt operations. Recommends **normal in-person operations**, with only routine caution for slick spots and cold.\n- News/Community Intel (20% weight): No official announcements, no neighboring district closures, and only a **regional**, non-specific note that “additional snow days are expected” somewhere in West Michigan. Major closing boards show **no early closures**.\n\nAll four sources broadly agree: conditions are cold and somewhat slick from the prior day but **not severe enough** to typically trigger a closure in Rockford.\n\n2. ARE THERE CONFLICTS?\n- The only potential tension is that a regional weather site mentions that some areas in West Michigan may see additional snow days on Thursday. However:\n  - It does **not** single out Rockford.\n  - Meteorology, history, and safety, which are localized to Rockford, all strongly support **low closure likelihood**.\n- There is **no direct conflict** in the core data: no ice, no new snow, good visibility, and good plow readiness all line up.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW END TO ~7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions end: around **late evening Wednesday (2026-01-14 ~23:00)**.\n- School start window: buses/commute around **6:00–7:40 AM Thursday**.\n- That gives roughly **7.5–8.5 hours** (11 PM–7:30 AM) of no new precip before typical start time.\n- With Michigan’s strong plow and salt operations and a low-traffic overnight window, this is **ample time** to clear primary routes and treat trouble spots. The safety assessment specifically expects primary roads to be “largely cleared and treated by 6–8 AM.”\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Forecast: **no new freezing rain or mixed precip** overnight into Thursday.\n- Risk is limited to **refreeze** of melt on pavement: characterized as **moderate ice formation risk** but manageable (parking lots ~8.5/10, walking 7/10, driving 8/10).\n- This is qualitatively very different from an active ice storm; it creates **spotty slick areas**, not system-wide hazardous ice.\n- On Michigan scales, this level of refreeze does **not** typically justify cancellation, especially with advance salting and sanding.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- News intel shows:\n  - **No neighboring district closures** currently listed.\n  - Major TV closing boards (e.g., FOX 17) show **no active closings** for Thursday yet.\n  - Community sentiment is marked \"uncertain\", not strongly expecting a snow day or treating this as a major event.\n- Per the instructions, if 3+ neighboring districts had closed, we’d add +15–20 percentage points. Right now there is **no such domino effect**, so **no upward adjustment** is applied.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey ways this 10% estimate could fail:\n- A **surprise, intense lake-effect band** shifts inland overnight and sets up directly over Rockford during the 4–7 AM window, producing sudden whiteouts and new accumulation. Current guidance and advisory language make this unlikely but not impossible.\n- A **worse-than-expected refreeze/black ice event** (e.g., under-estimated residual moisture) leads to widespread ice on rural bus routes, prompting a last-minute cancellation.\n- **Administrative caution**: If regional media push a strong “expect snow days” narrative or if several nearby inland districts decide to close for consistency, Rockford could follow despite relatively manageable local conditions.\n\n7. WEIGHTED DECISION (SHOWING THE MATH)\n- Meteorologist (35%): Describes a very low risk. Interpreted as roughly **5–10%**. Weight contribution (take midpoint 7.5%): 0.35 × 7.5 ≈ **2.6**.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, normal operations, minimal commute impact. Interpreted as **5–10%**. Midpoint 7.5% × 0.25 ≈ **1.9**.\n- History (20%): Analogues 5–10%, seasonal adjustment slightly downward. Use **7.5%** → 0.20 × 7.5 ≈ **1.5**.\n- News/Intel (20%): Regional mention of “additional snow days” pushes slightly above the bare-minimum risk but with no local closures or strong buzz. Interpret as **10–15%** local closure risk for Rockford, midpoint 12.5% → 0.20 × 12.5 ≈ **2.5**.\n\nSumming contributions: 2.6 + 1.9 + 1.5 + 2.5 ≈ **8.5%**. Rounding slightly upward to reflect the non-zero regional caution signal yields a **final probability of 10%**.\n\n8. THRESHOLD CHECK (MICHIGAN-SPECIFIC)\n- Expected new snow: **0\"** (well under the <4\" bracket, which itself only carries 5–15% risk in Michigan).\n- No ice storm, no accumulating snow, no blizzard criteria, and no 3+ neighboring district closures.\n- This squarely supports a probability in the **lower end of the 5–15% band**.\n\nFinal call: **Rockford Public Schools are very likely to be open on Thursday, January 15, 2026**, with only a small (≈10%) chance of a closure or delay driven by unexpected localized issues or administrative caution.\n",
