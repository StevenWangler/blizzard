  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology: Calls for a cold, windy day with light accumulation (≈0.6\", maybe up to ~1\") and a late-morning burst of moderate snow/blowing snow. Explicitly labels snow-day closure probability as low.\n- History: Analog events (1–2\" daytime snow, temps near 30–33°F, gusts 20–30 mph, no ice) show only 5–10% closure rates. Emphasizes that West Michigan usually stays open unless there is 8–10\"+ before the commute, ice, or extreme cold.\n- Safety: Rates road/driving conditions as moderate but manageable (primary roads 7/10, secondary 6/10, walking 5/10). Recommends a normal school day with monitoring; states totals and timing do not justify a full snow day.\n- News/Intel: Local forecasts and district communications show ~1\" during school, with the bigger 3–5\" event Tuesday night into Wednesday. No Rockford or neighboring district closures announced; no strong social/media expectation of a snow day.\n\nAll four lines of evidence agree that:\n- Snow amounts during the school day are low (≈0.5–1\").\n- The heaviest impacts are mid/late morning, not before the bus commute.\n- There is no ice storm signal.\n- Local infrastructure and norms treat this as a routine winter day.\n- No domino-effect of neighboring closures is underway.\n\nThere are no substantive conflicts—only minor emphasis differences (safety calls risk “moderate,” meteorology calls closure probability “low”), which are compatible: conditions can be moderately risky yet still below closure thresholds.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Snow onset: Around 9 AM.\n- Morning bus window: ~6–8 AM.\n- Snow end / taper: Heaviest from ~9 AM–noon, then lighter/blowing snow into early afternoon.\n- By 7:40 AM (typical start time), there has been essentially 0\" accumulation. Plows have **nothing significant to clear before buses**.\n- During the day, totals remain around 0.5–1\"; this can be handled with on-the-fly salting and intermittent plowing of main routes and lots.\n\nEffectively, the plow timing is highly favorable for **staying open**: no overnight backlog and low total accumulation, so the usual criterion of “not enough time to clear before school” is not met.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology explicitly notes no meaningful freezing rain or ice signal; this is a pure snow/wet-snow/blowing-snow setup.\n- Temps rise from mid-20s°F at daybreak toward 32–33°F by late morning/afternoon—conditions where salt is effective.\n- Safety flags only a *moderate* ice-formation risk in the sense of slick spots/black ice, not a glaze event.\n\nIn Michigan decision-making, ice is often the major game changer. Its absence strongly supports a low closure probability.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Rockford Public Schools: Website shows a normal schedule for Dec 9 with no alerts, banners, or special instructions.\n- Forest Hills Public Schools and other nearby districts: No public closure/delay announcements or hints of leaning towards closure.\n- Regional news/closing lists: No evidence of a broad Kent County closure wave for Dec 9.\n- Community sentiment: Characterized as uncertain and generally treating this as a “messy but manageable” winter event, not an exceptional storm.\n\nPer the weighting instructions, News/Intel is the “secret weapon”: since there are **no neighboring closures** and no clear expectation of closure, we do **not** apply any upward adjustment for domino effects or strong public expectation.\n\n5. Quantitative weighting\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly suggests a low closure risk due to light totals and favorable timing. This alone would suggest roughly a 10–15% probability.\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as moderate but explicitly says they do not justify a full snow day. That supports a probability near the low end, about 10–20%; I lean ~15% from this component.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 5–10%. This pulls the blended probability down into the single/low double digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures announced, no social/media drumbeat for a snow day, and recognition that the **bigger** event is Tuesday night/Wednesday. This supports a probability near or slightly under 15%.\n\nCombining these, and applying Michigan’s thresholds (<4\" → 5–15% in this framework), the integrated probability naturally falls near the **lower part** of the 5–15% band. I set the final value at **12%** to reflect that there *is* some risk (e.g., if the morning snow arrives earlier or is heavier than forecast) but that all expert lines keep this clearly below typical closure criteria.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nMain ways this could be too low:\n- Forecast bust toward **heavier, earlier snow**: If snow bands form 3–4 hours earlier, producing several inches (4\"+) on roads before 6–7 AM, closure probability would jump into the 35–60%+ range.\n- Undetected **ice component**: If a warm layer aloft or surface-based freezing drizzle develops and creates significant glazing, Michigan districts would likely close or at least delay, especially on untreated rural routes.\n- Sudden **domino of neighboring closures** overnight: If 3+ major neighboring districts close based on localized conditions or updated forecasts, Rockford might follow for consistency and safety.\n\nWays it could be too high (overestimating risk):\n- If snowfall underperforms even the current light forecast (e.g., only flurries, little accumulation), the true closure probability would be closer to the 5% floor.\n\nGiven that current data show none of the high-risk failure modes in play as of the 2025-12-08 23:05Z analysis time, a 12% snow-day probability with **high** confidence is justified.\n\n7. Final decision\n- **Best estimate**: Rockford Public Schools hold a **normal in-person school day on Tuesday, Dec 9, 2025**, possibly with slightly slower midday travel and attention to dismissal conditions, but no full closure.",
