    "Forecast is rain (not snow) with air temps staying above freezing around bus/commute time (mid-30s °F); no accumulating snow/ice signal",
    "No extreme cold signal: morning wind chills/feels-like are ~upper 20s to low 30s (well above Michigan cold-closure thresholds)",
    "Primary hazard is localized: heavier rain around ~4–6 AM plus near-freezing *surface* temps could cause isolated slick bridges/overpasses and ponding—more consistent with minor delays than a closure",
    "News/decision signals are strongly ‘open’: no Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay postings found; FOX17 closings page showed no active closings/delays; no community buzz",
    "Infrastructure and power aren’t stressed: roads currently clear; agencies equipped to spot-treat; power outages essentially nil in Kent County (1 customer out)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs converge on a mild, wet system for Rockford with temperatures above freezing and zero snowfall expected—this is typically an ‘open’ day in Michigan. The only credible pathway to disruption is a narrow-margin surface-temperature issue: if bridge decks/untreated elevated surfaces briefly reach ~32°F while rain is occurring (or immediately after), isolated glazing/black-ice spots could appear, especially on rural routes and overpasses. That scenario historically drives targeted spot-treating and sometimes a 2-hour delay, but it rarely produces a district-wide closure without a clear freezing-rain headline or widespread subfreezing conditions.\n\nThere are no “domino effect” signals: the latest available checks show no active closings/delays on FOX17, no Rockford announcement, and no neighboring-district postings. Infrastructure capability is normal/ready (spot-treatment likely if needed), and power-grid status is stable (Kent County ~0% out). Given the strong consensus (agents within ~2% spread) and the lack of leading closure indicators, the Brier-score-optimized call is a low single-digit-to-high single-digit closure probability.\n\nRecommendation: **Open with monitoring** (not a snow day). If anything changes, it’s more likely to be a **2-hour delay** than a full closure, driven by observed slick bridges or localized flooding/ice-jam detours—not snow accumulation.",
