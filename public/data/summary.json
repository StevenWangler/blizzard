  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. Expert agreement:\n- Meteorologist: Main storm and worst winds are Monday; by early Tuesday (midnight–7 AM) it is cold, dry, and cloudy with no new snow and improving roads. Tuesday daytime sees cold, breezy, mostly quiet weather with <1\" additional snow mainly in the evening.\n- Historian: This is a classic post-storm cleanup day. Historical analogs with similar conditions (post-warning day, light lake-effect mainly after school hours, wind chills above extreme thresholds) yield low closure rates, roughly 5–15%.\n- Safety analyst: Morning commute impact Tuesday is minimal; primary routes good, secondary routes manageable with caution. Main new impacts are after 6 PM Tuesday, suggesting normal opening is safe.\n- News/community: Rockford Public Schools are already closed for Winter Break, with Dec 30 explicitly on break. Neighboring districts appear similarly on break, so there is no active snow-day decision pressure.\nAll four streams agree there is no strong basis for a weather-driven cancellation of a normal school day; additionally, there is no normal school day scheduled.\n\n2. Points of disagreement:\n- The meteorological visibility field lists a minimum visibility of 0 miles, but the narrative clarifies that any whiteouts are mainly Monday and again Tuesday evening, not during Tuesday’s morning window.\n- Safety labels overall risk as “moderate” because of cold, some ice risk, and evening deterioration, but explicitly states that these do not justify a morning closure.\nThese differences are about framing, not about the core question of a Tuesday morning snow day. Substantive conflict is minimal.\n\n3. Plow timing math (midnight–7:40 AM):\n- Storm’s main phase and strongest winds occur Monday, with conditions already improving by late Monday night.\n- The meteorological summary notes a clean, dry window from roughly midnight to at least 7 AM Tuesday with no new snow falling.\n- Safety assessment says road crews will have all day Monday and into the overnight to clean up; primary roads rated 8/10 by Tuesday morning, secondary 7/10.\nThis gives well over 8 hours of non-snowing, subfreezing but dry conditions before a typical ~7:40 AM start, ample for Michigan plow operations.\n\n4. Ice assessment:\n- Temperatures remain below freezing with 24 straight freezing hours and some refreeze risk. Safety flags ice risk as moderate, especially on bridges and shaded spots.\n- Critically, there is no indication of new freezing rain or glazing—just refreeze on residual moisture.\n- No expert flags a major ice event or widespread glazing that would overwhelm treatment.\nSo, there is some routine black-ice risk, but not the sort of significant ice storm that would push probabilities into the 60%+ range.\n\n5. Neighboring district behavior:\n- News intelligence explicitly notes no active snow-day closure announcements for nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) for Tuesday; most are also on winter break.\n- Because districts are already closed for break, the typical “domino effect” of three or more neighboring districts declaring weather closures does not apply; there are no +15–20% adjustments from this channel.\n\n6. What could make this prediction wrong?\n- A surprise, persistent lake-effect band setting up directly over Rockford during the early-morning commute with heavy rates and near-zero visibility—contrary to the current guidance that focuses heavier bands outside that window.\n- More significant overnight icing than modeled (e.g., widespread untreated wet surfaces plus colder-than-expected temps) producing far more black ice and crashes than anticipated.\n- A late-breaking operational or policy decision unrelated to weather (e.g., district using the storm as a reason to cancel an optional break-period activity) but that would be labeled a “closure” by some observers.\nGiven the data, these are low-probability edge cases.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Points to a low-impact Tuesday morning—no new snow, cold but not extreme, and improving roads. On Michigan’s thresholds, <1\" additional snow with good timing implies a very low closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Rates driving and walking conditions as 6–7/10 with only minimal morning commute impact and specifically recommends holding school as normal.\n- History (20%): Post-storm cleanup patterns with similar temps and light additional snow historically show ~5–15% snow-day rates; this supports a low baseline.\n- News intelligence (20%): Key “secret weapon” conclusion is that school is already on Winter Break; there is no operational school day to cancel, and neighboring districts are likewise on break, so there is no closure wave.\n\nPROBABILITY DETERMINATION:\n- Start from Michigan threshold guidance: For the forecast itself (light additional snow, post-storm cleanup, no ice storm, no blizzard during commute), the standard range would be roughly 5–15% for <4\" snow with good timing.\n- Historical analogs center near 10% for this kind of day; meteorology and safety both argue for the lower end of that range because the worst travel is displaced from the morning.\n- However, the decisive factor is the calendar: December 30 is part of Winter Break, so the chance of a traditional “snow day” decision (closing a scheduled day of instruction) is effectively near-zero.\nCombining these, I assign a 5% probability to capture small residual scenario risk (e.g., if one interprets cancellation of a specific optional program during break as a ‘closure’), but operationally this is a \"no snow day\" outcome.\n\nConfidence is high because all four expert domains align: the weather does not warrant a closure by Michigan standards, and there is no school day scheduled to close.",
