  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Ice, not snow, is the issue: All agree there is essentially no accumulating snow and that any hazard is from light freezing rain/drizzle plus freezing fog and saturated surfaces.\n- Marginal temps: Everyone has temps hovering 31–33°F through the night and commute—supportive of patchy glaze but not a deep-freeze ice storm.\n- Some risk to the morning commute: Meteorology, safety, and cross-check all point to hazardous spots on untreated surfaces for the early morning, especially bridges, rural and subdivision roads, sidewalks, and parking lots.\n- Rockford is on the fringe of the worst icing: Advisory core is north of Rockford (north of M‑46 / Newaygo, Mecosta, etc.); Rockford is at the southern/eastern edge.\n- Conditions improve mid-morning: Visibility and manageability improve after about 7–8 AM, with no new significant precip.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Closure severity:\n  • Meteorologist: \"Pattern favors school being open or, at most, a localized delay rather than a full snow day.\" \n  • Historian: Analog closure rates about 10–20% and an explicit seasonal adjustment toward LOWER closure probability.\n  • Safety analyst: Labels risk as \"high\" and gives ~55% probability that safety would justify full closure, 35% for 2‑hour delay, only 10% for normal start.\n  • Cross-check (met + safety): For Rockford proper, about 30% chance the morning verifies as the safety analyst’s \"high\" risk, ~60% as \"moderate,\" ~10% as \"low.\" It explicitly says the meteorologist’s framing better matches Rockford-specific data.\n- Visibility severity at commute: Safety stresses multiple hours near-zero visibility even into the commute; cross-check refines this—worst vis is mainly 12–6 AM; by 6–7 AM vis often 0.25–1 mile, and by 7–8 AM it improves sharply to several miles.\n- Ice amount at Rockford: Safety implicitly leans toward advisory-level 0.10\" glaze; meteorologist + cross-check say Rockford’s most likely extra accretion is 0.00–0.03\" from freezing fog/mist, not a full 0.10\" sheet.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow/ice end to 7:40 AM)\n- Cross-check/met: Meaningful new freezing rain/drizzle in Rockford tapers to very low levels roughly 3–5 AM, transitioning to freezing fog with little measurable QPF.\n- Safety tool clarifies:\n  • Treat ~4:00–5:00 AM as the window when new accretion becomes minimal; after that it’s mostly existing glaze.\n  • First buses: ~6:00–6:30 AM.\n  • Main start: ~7:30–7:45 AM.\n  • That gives about 2–3.5 hours between taper and first bell, depending which exact taper time you use, and 1–2 hours before the first buses.\n- This is enough for primary routes to be largely treated and passable in a Michigan system, but secondary and rural roads will still have meaningful slick spots.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Yes, but likely light to locally moderate in Rockford:\n  • Advisory targets ~0.10\" north of Rockford; Rockford is on edge.\n  • Cross-check: Expect total untreated glaze in Rockford to be mostly thin, patchy glaze (0.00–0.03\" additional overnight) on bridges, stairs, parking lots, and shaded pavement, not district‑wide thick ice.\n  • Safety correctly emphasizes that even a thin, invisible glaze is dangerous where it exists—especially at bus stops, parking lots, and rural routes.\n\n(5) Neighboring districts\n- News intel: As of late Monday night / very early Tuesday, there are NO posted closures or delays for nearby Kent County districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview, Kent City). No domino effect, no cluster of preemptive decisions.\n- That removes the +15–20% upward adjustment associated with 3+ neighbors closed.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- I’m underestimating closure risk if:\n  • The advisory ice corridor shifts just far enough south that Rockford actually gets ~0.10\"+ accretion by dawn (full advisory verification in-district), and/or\n  • Dense freezing fog with vis near 0–0.25 miles persists right through 7–8 AM instead of improving as guidance suggests, AND\n  • Road treatment underperforms (salt not applied aggressively overnight) so secondary roads and hills are sheet ice at 5–7 AM.\n  In that combination, a closure is much more defensible, potentially in the 50–60% realized-closure range.\n- I’d be overestimating closure risk if:\n  • Advisory underperforms in Kent County (as current Rockford-specific QPF fields suggest), with roads mostly wet and only spot-slick by 4–5 AM,\n  • Fog is patchy rather than dense at bus time, and\n  • Early-morning checks show main and secondary routes largely manageable.\n  Then actual closure odds could fall closer to 10–20%.\n\n2. WEIGHTING THE EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Emphasizes no snow, marginal icing, Rockford on advisory edge, point forecast with zero additional QPF and improving visibility. Meteorologist explicitly expects school open or at most localized delay.\n- Safety (25%): Strongly ice-averse, giving 55% closure from a pure safety lens, but its high-risk framing was partly based on broader advisory conditions, not the Rockford-fringe pattern clarified by met/cross-check.\n- History (20%): Multiple analogs all show 10–20% historical closure rates in nearly identical setups (light glaze, fog, temps near 32°F, main roads treated, no snow). Seasonal context for Michigan pushes probability DOWN (unusual to close for this without more severe ice or snow).\n- News Intel (20%): Critical tiebreaker. No neighboring closures, no crash-wave reports, no high-anxiety community chatter. Discussion continually frames Kent County as on the southern/fringe edge of concern.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Meteorology + History + News Intel are aligned on: marginal event, more likely open than closed.\n- Safety is the main outlier, but cross-check tempers its worst-case for Rockford to a 30% probability of truly \"high\" risk and 60% \"moderate\" risk.\n- Applying the prescribed weights:\n  • Meteorology (35%): suggests something like 20–25% closure odds.\n  • History (20%): suggests ~15–20%.\n  • Safety (25%): 55% closure, but scaled down for Rockford-specific cross-check (30% chance of that high-risk verification) → effective closure signal closer to ~30–35%.\n  • News (20%): with no neighbor closures and fringe risk, leans ~15–20%.\n  Weighted blend lands roughly in the mid‑20s to low‑30s; I choose 32% to reflect: (a) real ice risk, (b) modest tail risk of advisory sliding south, but (c) strong local tolerance and fringe placement.\n\n3. APPLYING THE MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS & NEWS RULES\n- Snow thresholds: 0\" snow → base 5–15% for Michigan (routine), barring major ice.\n- Ice rule: \"8+ inches OR ice = 60–85%\" is for clear, widespread icing events. Here, Rockford is fringe, with expected light glaze, not a classic ice storm.\n- Historical base for this specific pattern: ~10–20% closure rate suggests we stay well below 50%.\n- News intelligence adjustments:\n  • No 3+ neighboring districts closed → no +15–20% bump.\n  • Community sentiment is \"uncertain / wait-and-see,\" not \"we’re definitely closing.\" No +10–15% bump here.\n  • No chatter of \"this is nothing\" either, so I don’t drive it all the way down to minimum values.\n\n4. FINAL CALL & WHY I AVOID 40–60%\n- Expert conflict is real, but cross-check resolves much of it in favor of \"moderate\" risk for Rockford, not genuinely split 50/50.\n- Meteorology, history, and news (75% of the weighting) clearly point to a sub‑40% closure scenario.\n- Safety, even after Rockford-specific moderation, still argues for caution—but not enough to overcome the other three domains, especially in a high-tolerance Michigan district with no neighbor domino.\n- That justifies a decided stance below 40% rather than a hedged 40–60% range.\n\nThus, I set the snow/ice day probability at **32%**, with **moderate** confidence: there is a non-trivial chance of closure or delay if overnight observations surprise to the icy side, but the more likely outcome is that Rockford opens, possibly with enhanced caution or a localized delay rather than a full snow day.\n",
