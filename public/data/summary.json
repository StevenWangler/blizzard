    "No accumulating snow expected during the 12:00 AM–7:40 AM school window; plowing operations are not the limiting factor",
    "No extreme cold trigger: verified feels-like values remain well above -20°F during 6–8 AM bus hours",
    "Main risk is localized freezing fog/black ice around ~5–8 AM (bridges/overpasses/untreated neighborhood streets), which more commonly leads to caution or a delay than a full closure",
    "Infrastructure signals: main roads expected passable; any response would be spot-salting rather than plows overwhelmed",

  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs broadly agree this is an ‘open’ day meteorologically and operationally: essentially zero morning snow/precip, modest winds, and wind chills nowhere near the ≤-20°F automatic-closure threshold. The only meaningful hazard is a narrow daybreak window of freezing fog/near-saturation air with temps in the mid/upper 20s, which can create isolated black ice—especially on bridges/ramps and untreated neighborhood routes that buses use. That risk supports monitoring and potentially a targeted/short delay if driver test-loops find widespread glazing, but it does not justify a district-wide closure in typical mid-Feb Michigan readiness absent confirmed widespread icing, crashes, or materially reduced visibility.\n\nNews intelligence reduces the ‘domino effect’ concern for Tuesday: FOX17 currently shows no active closings/delays, and Rockford Public Schools has no Tuesday closure/delay post visible on its website/news archive. Power-grid conditions are also supportive of normal operations (statewide outages very low and decreasing), making an outage-driven closure unlikely.\n\nNet: keep full closure probability low but non-zero (freezing fog can overperform and produce crash clusters). The most likely admin action is OPEN, with a smaller chance of a 2-hour delay if early-morning spot checks show widespread glazing on bus routes.",
