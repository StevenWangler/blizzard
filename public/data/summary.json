  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement checklist\n• Meteorologist: No new snow or precip Sunday into Monday; cold, breezy, but routine winter conditions. Explicit statement that meteorological risk for closure is very low and school should be open on time.\n• Historian: Very similar past patterns around Rockford almost never produce snow days. Analog snow‑day rate ~2–5% with this setup and local standards. Notes that true closure events require 8\"+ snow, blizzard/whiteout, significant ice, or dangerous arctic cold – none present.\n• Safety analyst: Rates road and travel conditions as good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, lots 8/10); morning and afternoon commute impact both \"minimal\". Recommends normal operations and states weather/roads do not justify a snow day or delay.\n• News/community intel: No district or neighboring district closure announcements, no special weather messaging, no event cancellations, and social media sentiment is quiet (\"no_buzz\").\n\nAll four lines of evidence independently point to: (a) no active storm, (b) manageable winter roads, and (c) no institutional or community movement toward closure.\n\n2. Conflicts and clarifications\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n• Meteorology vs. Safety: Both say conditions are cold but dry, with only localized slick spots. No disagreement on timing or severity.\n• Meteorology vs. History: Forecast fits a common mid‑January, post‑system pattern with extremely low historical closure rate. Alignment is strong.\n• Safety vs. News Intel: Good road conditions and lack of active hazards are consistent with the absence of closure chatter or official alerts.\nThe only slight nuance is that the safety report flags a \"moderate\" ice formation risk in the abstract, but then immediately characterizes actual Monday‑morning impacts as minimal and manageable. That nuance does not rise to a real conflict.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n• Worst conditions from the prior minor event: Saturday 2026‑01‑10, roughly 17:00–22:00 local.\n• Sunday 2026‑01‑11: Dry, below‑freezing, breezy, no new snow or rain.\n• School start: about 7:40 AM Monday 2026‑01‑12.\nThat leaves all of Sunday daytime and Sunday night (well over 24 hours after the last meaningful precip) for plows and salt to work. With total new snow since Saturday being light and no additional overnight accumulation, Kent County’s experienced crews can easily clear and treat roads. By bus time, conditions should be standard winter driving, not storm conditions.\n\n4. Ice considerations\n• Air temps stay below freezing, so any remaining moisture can refreeze.\n• However, there is no new precipitation Sunday into Monday: no rain, freezing rain, or drizzle to create fresh glaze ice.\n• Safety analysis expects only isolated slick spots on bridges, shaded curves, and lesser‑traveled roads/sidewalks, not widespread ice.\nGiven Michigan norms, scattered slick patches are handled by standard salting and winter driving protocols and are not usually enough to cancel school absent other hazards. There is no signal of a true ice event.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals\n• News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD and found no pre‑announced closures for Jan 12.\n• Kent County messaging focuses on weight restrictions related to thaw, not snow/ice hazards, reinforcing the non‑event character of this period.\n• Social media and local chatter show no organized expectation of a snow day – no \"everyone’s talking about shutting down\" signal.\nUnder the competition rules, we would only bump probabilities up if there were multiple neighboring closures or strong community expectation; here, there is the opposite: region‑wide normal operations.\n\n6. How each expert was weighted\n• Meteorology (35% weight): Direct forecast of 0\" new snow, dry conditions, and no active advisories at decision time. On its own, this suggests a closure probability near the very bottom of the Michigan threshold scale (~5–10%).\n• Safety (25%): High road and travel scores, minimal commute impact, normal operations recommended. This reinforces a very low probability, keeping the estimate near 5–10%.\n• History (20%): Analog snow‑day rates of ~2–5% for this exact synoptic setup in Rockford/Kent County. Pulls the forecast slightly toward the lower end of our internal range.\n• News/Intel (20% – \"secret weapon\"): No closure announcements, no buzz, no neighboring‑district moves. Crucially, there are no positive closure signals that would justify any upward adjustment. In fact, the lack of buzz supports staying at or just above the historical base rate.\n\n7. Calibration vs. Michigan thresholds\nYour provided Michigan thresholds:\n• <4\" snow → 5–15%\nHere we have 0\" new snow and no ice storm. That firmly places this day at the very bottom of that bracket. Given local tolerance for winter weather and the complete absence of an active event, the calibrated Brier‑score‑focused choice is toward the low edge.\n\n8. Final probability and confidence\nCombining:\n• Historical analogs (~2–5%).\n• Dry forecast and strong infrastructure (argues near 5%).\n• Slight residual risk from patchy ice and the generic possibility of last‑minute issues (argues not going all the way to 0–2%).\nI set the final snow‑day probability at 5% with high confidence. This is decisively out of the 40–60% uncertainty band and aligned with both data and Michigan closure norms.\n\n9. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes are:\n• A late‑developing, poorly forecast band of snow or freezing drizzle Sunday night that materially changes conditions after this analysis.\n• A non‑weather operational issue (major power outage, heating failures, or a significant accident impacting transportation).\n• An unexpectedly cautious administrative decision unrelated to the forecast pattern (for example, stacking a closure on top of other calendar factors). These are historically rare in Rockford with this kind of weather.\nBecause these scenarios are low‑probability but not impossible, I do not go to 0–2%; 5% captures these tail risks while still recognizing that, based on all four expert inputs, a normal school day is overwhelmingly likely.",
