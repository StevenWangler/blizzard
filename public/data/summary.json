  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. AGREEMENTS ACROSS EXPERTS\n- Meteorology: Cold, dry, below-freezing day with NO new snow or freezing rain and generally good visibility during the commute.\n- Safety: Roads mostly clear with only patchy residual ice from Sunday; risk level explicitly marked as low and commute impact minimal.\n- History: Very similar past patterns in Rockford have closure rates of ~1–5%; districts almost never close for cold alone at these temps without an active storm.\n- News/Intel: No advisories or closures for Kent County; Rockford calendar shows a normal day; no neighboring districts signaling closure and no social media \"buzz.\"\nAll four agree there is no active storm, no widespread ice hazard, and that conditions are typical operational winter weather.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS\n- There are essentially no substantive conflicts. Meteorology, safety, and history are tightly aligned on “low risk, routine winter day.” News intelligence confirms the lack of closure signals. Minor nuance: safety notes a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in spots, but still rates overall conditions and commute impact as low.\nGiven this, there is no need to adjust for expert conflict; the signal is consistently low-risk.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM STORM END TO 7:40 AM)\n- Precipitation associated with the prior freezing-rain event is described as occurring Sunday, with **no new precip after Sunday night** and none overnight into Monday.\n- By the time we reach Monday 7:40 AM bus/school arrival, crews will have had:\n  - Most of Sunday + Sunday evening to work the roads after the freezing rain.\n  - The entire night with **no new accumulation**.\n- Effective plow/salt window before 7:40 AM is well over 8–12 hours of dry time (in reality closer to a full day), which is more than enough for Kent County/Rockford operations to clear primary and most secondary routes.\nThis supports the safety analyst’s scores (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10).\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorology: \"no accumulating snow or ice expected\" Monday; no freezing-rain signal overnight.\n- Safety: flags **moderate ice-formation risk** only in the sense of refreezing of residual moisture/patchy black ice, not new glaze. They still classify travel risk as low and commute impact minimal.\n- History: Similar situations (post-ice, then dry and cold) rarely lead to closures once crews have had a full treatment window.\nConclusion: There may be localized slick spots (bridges, shaded rural roads, sidewalks/parking lots), but there is **no evidence of a widespread, active ice event**. In Michigan terms, this is manageable and not closure-worthy.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICT ACTIONS\n- News intelligence explicitly states: no closing lists populating for Rockford or core neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD), and no hints of a “domino effect” setup.\n- No Winter Weather Advisories or Warnings for Kent County.\nPer the weighting rules, we would only add +15–20% if 3+ neighboring districts were already closed or strongly signaling closure. Currently, none are.\nTherefore, there is **no upward adjustment** from neighboring-district behavior.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nKey ways this forecast could fail:\n- A surprise overnight event: unforecast freezing drizzle or a localized band creating a widespread ice glaze before crews can respond.\n- A major model bust: unexpected lake-effect band parking over Rockford pre-dawn, laying down several inches with poor visibility and untreated roads.\n- Significant localized black ice that’s much worse than indicated by current data (e.g., due to unnoticed melt/refreeze on many rural routes) leading to multiple early-morning accident reports. In that case, districts could make a 5–6 AM call based on law-enforcement/transportation feedback, but present guidance does not suggest this is likely.\nGiven current data, these are low-probability tail risks, but they justify not giving a 0% prediction.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates no storm, no precip, and only typical cold/wind. If used alone, this would suggest a closure probability around 2–4%. I anchor at ~3% from this domain.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates conditions as low risk with minimal commute impacts and high road scores. This aligns with a similar 2–4% closure likelihood; I use ~3% here as well.\n- History (20% weight): Historical snow-day rates for matching patterns: 1%, 2%, and 5%. A blended value is ~2–3%. I use 2.5% from history.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): \"No buzz,\" no alerts, no neighbors hinting at closing, normal district calendar. That pushes probability slightly **downward** from what pure weather/climatology might imply, suggesting ~1–3%. I use ~2% for this component.\n\nCombining (roughly):\n- Meteorology: 3% * 0.35 ≈ 1.1\n- Safety: 3% * 0.25 ≈ 0.8\n- History: 2.5% * 0.20 ≈ 0.5\n- News/Intel: 2% * 0.20 ≈ 0.4\nTotal ≈ 2.8%, which I round to a clear, decisive **3%**.\n\nGiven Michigan’s higher closure thresholds, the absence of active winter alerts, no neighboring closures, and very low historical closure rates for this setup, a 3% probability is both realistic and conservative for Brier-score competition: not 0% (tail risk acknowledged), but firmly in the “school almost certainly in session” regime.\n\nDECISION: Rockford Public Schools should **plan for a normal, on-time school day** on Monday, Dec 15, 2025.",
