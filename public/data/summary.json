  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert Agreement vs. Conflict\n- Meteorologist: Describes classic lake-effect nuisance event—cold, scattered light to moderate snow showers, about 0.8\" new snow on Sunday, no major storm overnight into Monday. Assigns roughly 10–20% chance of a full closure and 50–60% chance of a normal school day.\n- Historian: Finds analog patterns where advisory-level snow over the weekend with teens/low 20s temps and modest winds almost always leads to school operating on time Monday. Historical closure probability 5–15% in the closest matches, rarely above 20% unless there’s a stronger band or extreme cold. \n- Safety Analyst: Rates primary roads 7/10, secondary 6/10, parking lots 6/10, walking 5/10—\"moderate\" risk but explicitly concludes conditions support holding school open with standard winter precautions rather than a full snow day.\n- News & Community Intel: Confirms Jan 19, 2026 is already listed as \"No School – MLK Jr. Day / All Staff PD\" on Rockford’s official calendar and communications. No neighboring districts are issuing weather-based closure alerts for that date; most are also off for the holiday.\n\nAreas of agreement:\n- All three operational experts (meteorology, history, safety) indicate a low, not zero, probability of a weather-driven closure if this were a normal school day.\n- All agree this is an advisory-level, routine West Michigan winter pattern, not a high-end storm or ice event.\n- News intel strongly supports that there is no active weather-based closure domino effect; Jan 19 is a calendar holiday/PD day.\n\nMinor tensions (not true conflicts):\n- Safety flags a \"high\" ice formation risk but still concludes conditions are consistent with staying open using winter protocols.\n- Meteorology suggests 10–20% closure probability; historian leans closer to the lower edge of that range (~5–15%). These are compatible, not contradictory.\n\n2. Plow Timing Math\n- Worst conditions span most of Sunday (00:00–23:59 Sunday) with ongoing lake-effect.\n- New snow in the 24 hours before Monday is modest (~0.8\"), spread over the day with no intense overnight burst right at normal bus time.\n- With active plow and salt crews all day Sunday and Sunday night, there are many hours between the last modest bursts and a typical ~7:40 AM school start window. Even if light snow continues, crews in Kent County are accustomed to handling this level of accumulation.\n- Effective \"hours from last significant accumulation to the commute\" is comfortably within what Rockford usually operates in, so plow timing does not point toward a closure.\n\n3. Ice Considerations\n- Temperatures remain below freezing with wind chills single digits; that does favor persistent slick spots and some compacted snow/ice.\n- Critically, there is no strong signal of freezing rain, flash freeze, or melt–refreeze transition—just steady cold. The small mention of possible light freezing drizzle around 4 AM Sunday is (a) not timed to Monday morning, and (b) embedded within an otherwise snow-dominant pattern.\n- Safety assessment labels ice formation risk \"high\" in the sense of ongoing slickness on untreated surfaces, but still rates roads and travel as manageable with proper treatment. This is not the kind of widespread glazing that historically forces broad closures.\n\n4. Neighboring Districts and Community Signals\n- News intelligence shows no weather-driven closure announcements for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD tied specifically to Monday, Jan 19. Where visible, they also show it as an MLK/no-school day.\n- There is no social/media narrative of an imminent Monday-morning storm or catastrophic travel; chatter is about the general lake-effect pattern and cold.\n- Under the competition framework, neighboring district weather closures would normally bump the probability up, but here, they are not closing for weather at all—they are simply scheduled off.\n\n5. Weighting the Experts\nUsing the specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates 10–20% closure risk under normal school operations with current data. I take ~15% as the center of this range.\n- Safety (25%): \"Moderate\" risk but explicitly recommends school open with winter precautions. That corresponds to something like 10–20%; I again anchor near 15%.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs 5–15% closure likelihood; given modest totals and sub-warning winds, I lean toward ~10%.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Secret weapon here: confirms this day is pre-scheduled as no school, not a potential snow day, and shows no neighbor weather-closure trend. In Brier-score terms, for the specific question \"will there be a *weather-caused* snow day announcement?\" this pushes the probability down because the district doesn’t need or typically issue a snow-day call on a holiday/PD day.\n\nBlending these:\n- Raw weather-based closure probability (if Jan 19 were a regular school day):\n  • Meteorology ~15%\n  • Safety ~15%\n  • History ~10%\n  Weighted ≈ 0.35*15 + 0.25*15 + 0.20*10 ≈ 5.25 + 3.75 + 2 = 11% from those three.\n- News Intelligence Adjustment (20% weight): Because this is a planned no-school day, the chance of a *formal snow day* is even less than the raw weather closure risk. Administratively, they have no incentive to rebrand the day as a snow day. I treat news intel as nudging the final probability slightly downward from the ~11–15% band.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high thresholds and the calendar context, I set the final snow day probability at 12%—within the 5–15% band appropriate for <4\" and nuisance-level conditions, and slightly below the midpoints of the meteorology/safety ranges due to the strong calendar signal.\n\n6. What Would Make This Wrong?\n- Upside (probability actually higher than 12%):\n  • A stronger-than-forecast lake-effect band parks over northern Kent County overnight Sunday, dropping several inches (3–5\"+) right into the 3–7 AM window with near-whiteout visibility.\n  • Unexpected significant icing (e.g., a freezing drizzle episode Sunday night) creates widespread glazing on top of packed snow, sharply lowering road scores early Monday.\n  • Power issues or major accidents affecting key corridors.\n- Downside (probability even lower than 12%):\n  • Forecast trends drier, with only flurries late Sunday and mainly clear roads by Monday morning.\n  • District explicitly communicates that Monday is \"no school for holiday/PD\" with no mention of weather at all (which is already the pattern in current intel), reinforcing that they won’t frame it as a snow day.\n\nConsidering all four expert domains and Michigan-specific closure thresholds, the best calibrated, competition-ready estimate for a *weather-caused snow day announcement* on Monday, Jan 19, 2026 is about 12%, with high confidence that any student time off that day is due to the planned calendar, not the storm.",
