  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, overcast day; 0% meaningful precip, 0.0\" snow, no storm, normal visibility; explicitly calls the snow-day probability \"essentially 0%\".\n- Historian: Finds multiple strong analogs (cold, dry, no alerts, modest wind chills) all with 0% historical snow day rate and high confidence; stresses Michigan closures are driven by heavy snow, ice, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold — none present here.\n- Safety analyst: Road and travel risk rated low; primary and secondary roads ~9/10, minimal commute impact, normal schedule recommended; main caution is routine winter slick spots only.\n- News intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closure announcements, no emergency travel advisories, and media framing this as notable cold but not a closure-level event.\nAll four domains independently conclude that Friday is a normal school day with no weather-based justification for closure or delay.\n\n2. Conflicts or disagreements:\nThere are no material conflicts. Every expert indicates:\n- No significant new snow or ice.\n- Cold is noticeable but not at closure thresholds.\n- Roads are serviceable with routine winter caution.\n- No institutional or community signal of closures.\nMinor nuance: news intel mentions \"light snow chances\" <1\" over 48 hours, while the meteorological packet here has 0\". Even if a dusting occurred, it would fall well below any Michigan closure threshold, so this does not change the decision.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Forecast snowfall: effectively 0\"; no accumulating overnight or during commute.\n- End of meaningful precip: already dry by Thursday night and through Friday morning.\n- Time between last snowfall and first bell (~7:40 AM): many hours, but functionally irrelevant because there is no new accumulation needing cleanup.\n- Result: Plows are not required for new snow. Any residual icy patches from previous days can be treated by standard pre-school maintenance, not by a storm-response operation. Plow timing does not create a closure/delay rationale.\n\n4. Ice considerations:\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain or mixed precip; temps remain below freezing but with dry pavement expected.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk noted as \"moderate\" only in the sense that existing slick spots can persist in cold; no active icing event.\n- History: Highlights that closures in this region for ice are associated with active freezing rain or widespread glaze, which is absent here.\nConclusion: There is no active ice storm or significant new glazing — only routine early-December slick spots that schools and cities manage regularly. This is not an \"ice changes everything\" scenario.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel explicitly reports no closure or delay announcements for nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) and no wave of preemptive closures.\n- Therefore, there is no +15–20% upward adjustment for regional closures.\n\n6. What would make this forecast wrong?\nThe main ways this call could miss:\n- An unforecast, localized lake-effect band or freezing drizzle sets up overnight, laying down several inches of snow or a glaze directly over Rockford’s bus routes. Current wind direction (S–SW), lack of alerts, and guidance all argue strongly against this.\n- Wind chills unexpectedly plunge into the -15°F to -20°F range by morning. Given the temperature and wind forecasts, this would require a major model error. No such signal appears in any expert input.\n- A non-weather factor (infrastructure failure, heating issue, or local emergency) triggers closure. That is beyond weather-based prediction, and there are no hints of such issues in news intel.\nGiven the convergence of all expert domains and Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter cold, these failure modes are low probability.\n\n7. Weighting the experts:\n- Meteorology (35%): Dominant signal is zero new precip, sub-alert-level wind chills. This heavily supports \"school as normal\".\n- Safety (25%): Low road risk and explicit recommendation for a normal schedule reinforce the meteorological conclusion.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs with 0% closure rate under near-identical conditions provide strong confirmation.\n- News intelligence (20%): The secret-weapon factor — no closure buzz, no neighbor closures, no emergency advisories — removes any reason to inflate the risk.\nAll four lines of evidence point strongly to the same conclusion: essentially no weather-based justification for a snow day.\n\nSynthesis:\nGiven 0\" forecast accumulation, lack of ice, non-extreme cold, excellent road scores, and complete absence of regional closure signals, placing the probability materially above 0% would inflate the risk without evidence. To remain calibrated for Brier score performance while acknowledging small residual uncertainties (unforecast band, operational issues), the final probability is set at 1% rather than exactly 0%.",
