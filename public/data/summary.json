  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts align that this is not a Michigan-style snow-day setup: forecast snowfall is 0, no meaningful wintry precip signal, winds are modest, and wind chills are far above the -15°F to -20°F danger band (and nowhere near the automatic ≤-20°F threshold). The only credible operational hazard is freezing fog/mist during the 4–9 AM window, which can create (1) pockets of near-zero visibility and (2) patchy black ice—especially on bridges/overpasses, shaded rural segments, and low-lying routes near wetlands/river bottoms. Historically in Kent County, that combination more often produces a 2-hour delay (if anything) rather than a full closure unless visibility is widespread <0.25 mi and/or incidents spike before dispatch. News intelligence shows no neighboring district closures and no closure messaging from Rockford Public Schools at this time; infrastructure status suggests roads are generally clear with routine spot-treatment. Power-grid conditions do not indicate a widespread outage driver. Net: full closure remains unlikely; the practical risk is a short-notice delay decision around 5:45–6:15 AM if dense fog verifies broadly.",
