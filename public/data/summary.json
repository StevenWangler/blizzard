    "Rockford Public Schools is officially scheduled CLOSED on Mon, Feb 16, 2026 for Mid Winter Break (multiple official district sources)",
    "Neighboring districts (e.g., Cedar Springs, Forest Hills) also show scheduled mid-winter break on Feb 16, reinforcing the non-instructional day context (no domino/weather decision needed)",
    "No snow accumulation forecast (0 inches) and no hazardous wind chill signal; weather is not a closure driver for this date",
    "Secondary travel hazard: freezing fog/patchy black ice + reduced visibility (around ~1 mile at times) could affect morning travel, but this would more likely justify a delay *if* school were in session",
    "Power grid/outage risk appears negligible (near-zero county outages; no school facilities impacted)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Resolve the core conflict first: most experts were debating a weather-driven closure probability, but News Intelligence provides decisive operational ground truth—Rockford Public Schools is already closed on Monday, Feb 16, 2026 for Mid Winter Break (confirmed via district homepage/news post/calendar). That makes the family-facing ‘no school’ outcome effectively certain, independent of meteorology. Weather details (no snow, temps ~30–34F, light wind, wind chills mid-20s) do not meet Michigan closure thresholds; the only meaningful weather concern is localized freezing fog/patchy black ice and reduced visibility around 6–8 AM, which would typically support messaging or possibly a delay *if school were in session*, not a districtwide cancellation. Infrastructure and power grid inputs do not introduce override risks (roads generally clear with spot treatment; outages essentially none). Therefore: predict a very high probability of “no school” for Feb 16 due to the calendar closure, not due to weather.",
