  "decision_rationale": "All experts converged tightly (2–4% range; debate average ~3%) on a ‘quiet cold’ Monday: overcast, light winds, and—most importantly—no forecast snowfall or freezing precip, which removes Michigan’s main closure triggers. Web verification does not show any ≤ -20°F wind chill signal; both API and Weather.com sanity check keep feels-like in the single digits above zero, so the extreme-cold automatic-closure rules are not triggered. Infrastructure expectations are routine (no plowable snow), and power-outage risk is very low. The only plausible disruption pathway is local and late-breaking: pockets of reduced visibility (modeled ~1 mile, not dense-fog territory) and patchy black ice that depends on antecedent moisture from prior days/weekend (regional ice issues were noted on Fri 2/6, but no Monday-specific hazard is confirmed). In Michigan operations, those factors more often produce extra caution or, at most, a targeted delay—not a district-wide closure. Net: closure odds remain very low; monitor for a delay only if pre-dawn checks find widespread dense fog (<0.5 mi) or widespread slick secondary roads.",
