  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Meteorologist: Clear, dry, cold day on Thu Dec 11 with 0.0\" new snow, no freezing rain, winds under ~15 mph, and typical mid-20s°F temps. Explicitly calls snow-day risk \"very low\".\n- Historian: Very strong analog support that this pattern (dry, cold day after a previous mixed event) almost never cancels school in West Michigan; historical snow day rates around 1–5% with high confidence.\n- Safety analyst: Roads, parking lots, and walking conditions all rated 8–9/10 with only moderate ice/refreeze risk; morning and afternoon commute impacts both \"minimal\" and recommendation is normal operations with standard winter cautions.\n- News/community intel: No Thursday closures posted yet for Rockford or neighbors; community sentiment is \"uncertain/monitoring\" rather than strongly expecting a snow day. Medium risk messaging from a regional weather blog was focused more on the Wednesday event; there is no specific Thursday-closure drumbeat.\nAll four sources fundamentally agree: no active storm on Thursday, normal winter cold, and no major operational hazards. There are no true conflicts—only that the news intel notes elevated attention to the broader storm but does not contradict the low-risk Thursday forecast.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- The impactful wintry mix/snow is on Wednesday (Dec 10). By midnight going into Thursday, conditions are dry with temps in the low-to-mid 20s°F.\n- Timing analysis: worst road conditions window is shown as 00:00–07:00 on Dec 11, but with \"minimal\" morning commute impact. This reflects residual slick spots and refreeze, not active accumulation.\n- Local practice: West Michigan road crews typically work through the overnight; with no new snow falling, they have many hours to scrape, salt, and sand before a ~7:40 AM bus window.\n- Effective cleanup window: At least several dry, subfreezing hours overnight (roughly 6+ hours) for crews and salt to work. That is more than adequate for primary and bus routes, especially with a 9/10 road score.\nResult: Plow/salt timing supports a normal on-time start. There is no sign that crews will be overwhelmed at or near the opening bell.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Meteorology: No new freezing rain or mixed precip during the overnight into Thursday; air temps stay below freezing but conditions are dry.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk is labeled \"moderate\"—this refers to refreeze of leftover moisture in shaded spots, bridges, and side streets, not an ongoing ice storm.\n- History: Days with only residual slick spots but no active ice event almost never cause countywide closures in this region; instead they lead to cautionary messaging.\nConclusion: There is some background refreeze risk (typical for Michigan after a prior event) but no systemic ice hazard that would justify a high closure probability.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- No confirmed closures or delays yet for Thursday among Kent County neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) in the news intel.\n- TV closing portals (e.g., FOX 17) are in standby mode, with no early mass postings for Thursday.\n- A specialized West Michigan weather site highlights a medium risk for closures tied to the broader system, but specifically notes that ultimate decisions will depend on how conditions look by Thursday morning. That is caution, not a closure expectation.\n- Community sentiment: described as \"uncertain\" with no strong push that \"everyone expects a snow day\" and no notable reports of widespread bad roads or outages.\nPer the weighting rules, since we do NOT have 3+ neighboring districts confirmed closed and do not see a strong community expectation of closure, there is no positive adjustment from news intel.\n\n5. Weighted synthesis using the rubric\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors open; essentially a 0–5% closure scenario based on a dry, cold day with 0\" snow and no extreme cold. I treat this as ~3%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road and travel scores near the top of the scale and a clear statement that schools can operate normally. Interpreted as roughly 2–5% chance of closure for patchy, localized issues; I assign ~3%.\n- History (20% weight): Most analogous patterns show 1–5% closure probability, with the best analogs near 1%. I assign ~2%.\n- News intel (20% weight): Medium risk framing for the broader event and statewide caution, but no specific Thursday buzz or neighboring closures. That slightly nudges us upward from the strict historical/meteorological baseline but only marginally. I assign ~5% from this channel.\nWeighted blend:\n- (0.35 * 3) + (0.25 * 3) + (0.20 * 2) + (0.20 * 5)\n= 1.05 + 0.75 + 0.4 + 1.0\n= 3.2% ≈ 3%\n\n6. Michigan threshold framework\n- Total new snow: 0\" → base category is below the lowest \"<4\" snow\" threshold; per the rubric, that aligns with roughly 5–15% when there IS some snow. Here there is none, so we trend even lower.\n- No ice storm or blizzard, and wind chills are in the teens, well above the -15°F closure benchmark.\n- No mass neighboring closures to trigger the +15–20% adjustment.\nTherefore, a 3% snow day probability is fully consistent with Michigan’s higher tolerance and the provided thresholds.\n\n7. What would make this forecast wrong?\nThis call would be wrong (i.e., school closes) under low-probability but possible scenarios such as:\n- Overnight surprise: An unforecast band of lake-effect or system snow sets up and dumps several inches (4–8\"+) specifically over Rockford before dawn, especially if roads are not yet treated.\n- Black ice outbreak: More residual moisture than expected combined with underperforming road treatments leads to widespread black ice on major routes by ~6 AM, prompting transportation leaders to deem bus travel unsafe.\n- Infrastructure surprise: A localized but significant power outage or water issue emerges in the Rockford area unrelated to the weather forecast models (e.g., equipment failure), forcing closure despite decent roads.\nAll of these have some nonzero chance, but current data show them as unlikely.\n\nGiven strong alignment among meteorology, safety, and historical data, and only mild caution from news intel, I set the final Rockford Public Schools snow day probability for Thursday, Dec 11, 2025 at 3%, with high confidence that school will be open on a normal schedule.",
