  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Dry, quiet Thursday with no new snow, temps teens to near 20°F, wind chills single digits to around -10°F, no accumulating precip, light winds.\n- Historian: This pattern (cold, dry day following light snow/mix) almost always results in school operating normally in west-central Michigan; closures are rare without a fresh storm or dangerous wind chills.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads are generally in good shape (primary ~9/10, secondary ~8/10), with only localized slick spots from refreeze; bus operations and emergency access normal; conditions do not justify a full snow day.\n- News/Intel: Regional coverage highlights cold and some slick roads, but explicitly notes no new major storm for Dec 4; no advisories or broad \"avoid travel\" messaging; no neighboring-district closures or strong community expectation of a snow day.\n\nAll four agree: Thursday is cold but routine for Michigan, with refreeze/black ice as the main localized risk and no major storm or large-scale disruption signal.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- The only mild tension is in language:\n  - Safety labels overall risk level as \"moderate\" because of potential refreeze and cold exposure, especially 5–8 AM.\n  - Meteorologist and historian both frame the operational risk for schools as very low (historical closure rates 2–5%).\n  - News/Intel sentiment is \"uncertain\" in the community, but not skewed toward expecting closures.\n\nSubstance is aligned: even the safety assessment, while using the word \"moderate\" for risk, explicitly recommends normal operations, not closure. There is no core conflict that would warrant tool-driven reconciliation.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Prior light snow/freezing drizzle occurs Wednesday 12/03 and is said to have \"fully moved out by the pre-dawn hours Thursday\" per the meteorologist and NWS summary.\n- Reasonable interpretation: bulk of precip ends by approximately 11 PM–1 AM.\n- Morning bell/first bus-window reference ~7:40 AM.\n- That implies roughly 6–8+ hours of dry, subfreezing, non-snowing conditions for plows and salt trucks to work. Safety notes plows and salt are already active on 12/03 and expect primary and well-traveled secondary roads to be in good shape by early Thursday.\n- This plow window is ample for west Michigan operations when dealing with light accumulations and refreeze, strengthening the open-school expectation.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- No new freezing rain, sleet, or mixed precip is forecast for Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n- Ice risk is residual: refreeze of Wednesday’s slush/wet spots into patches of black ice, especially on bridges, shaded curves, and untreated neighborhood roads.\n- Safety rates ice risk as \"moderate\" but explicitly in a context of manageable, localized hazards typical of early winter. There is no signal of widespread glaze, powerline icing, or an ice storm.\n- Thus, there is some patchy ice, but not the kind of systemic ice event that historically drives high closure probabilities in Michigan.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News/Intel explicitly notes no public indications that Rockford or major neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have announced closures or delays for Thursday.\n- No pattern of early closures in similar conditions is cited, and no large regional event cancellations are reported.\n- Under the decision rules, 3+ neighboring districts closed would add +15–20 percentage points to the closure probability; here, that adjustment is 0 because there are zero closures and no strong rumor mill suggesting likely closure.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\nKey ways this forecast could understate closure probability:\n- Unexpected overnight lake-effect burst specifically targeting Rockford’s corridor between about 3–6 AM, dropping several inches of high-ratio snow not captured in current guidance.\n- More extensive than expected freezing drizzle or compaction Wednesday evening leaving a much larger extent of black ice, particularly on rural bus routes, discovered in 4:30–5:30 AM driver reports.\n- A last-minute wind chill downgrade (e.g., -20°F or colder broadly during bus-stop times) plus a district-level cultural choice to be conservative about cold, even without official advisories.\n- Non-weather factors (e.g., a major bus-fleet mechanical issue due to the cold) prompting operational closure independent of weather hazard.\n\nGiven the current data, all these failure modes are low probability. They justify monitoring, not preemptive closure.\n\nPROBABILITY CALCULATION AND WEIGHTING\nUsing the instructed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): No new snow, no active precip, under-10 mph winds, patchy fog at worst; prior system gone before pre-dawn hours. This strongly supports a very low closure chance, on the order of ~3–5%.\n- Safety (25%): Primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8.5/10, driving conditions 8/10. Risk flagged mainly as refreeze and cold exposure, yet the narrative recommendation is \"conditions do not justify a full snow day\" and suggests a normal start. This aligns with about ~5–10% closure probability, mostly to cover surprise problem spots on rural routes.\n- History (20%): Three close analog patterns show 2%, 3%, and 5% closure odds; typical early-December context and lack of alerts push expectations toward school being open. Weighted historical expectation ~3–4%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no strong public expectation of closure, no severe warning headlines beyond \"cold and slick spots.\" Community sentiment is \"uncertain\" but not closure-centric. This points to roughly ~5–8% to allow for overnight surprises that sometimes prompt a few unanticipated snow days.\n\nCombining these:\n- Meteorology (35% of, say, 4%) → 1.4\n- Safety (25% of 8%) → 2.0\n- History (20% of 4%) → 0.8\n- News/Intel (20% of 7%) → 1.4\nTotal baseline ≈ 5.6%. Rounding and giving slight upward room for low-likelihood surprises (e.g., unseen localized ice, microburst of lake-effect), I set the final probability at 8%.\n\nTHRESHOLDS AND RATIONALE\n- Michigan thresholds provided: with <4\" fresh snow the typical range is 5–15% unless there is ice. Here there is 0\" new snow and only localized refreeze, with no ice storm. This situates us at the low end of that band.\n- There are no winter storm or wind-chill advisories targeted at the school-commute period; historically, that strongly correlates with schools remaining open.\n- News Intelligence, our \"secret weapon,\" gives no reason to bump the probability upward: no neighboring closures, no strong public drumbeat for a snow day, no big events canceled.\n\nTo stay competitive on Brier score, a sharper prediction slightly above the strict historical mean (to respect minor uncertainties) but still clearly in the \"unlikely\" regime is appropriate. Thus: 8% with high confidence that school will be open.\n",
