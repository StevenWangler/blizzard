  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Expert agreement:\n- Meteorologist: Tuesday 12/30 is cold, breezy, but mostly dry with under 1\" new snow and no ice; main storm impacts are Monday.\n- Historian: This pattern matches a typical post-storm, cold-but-quiet day. Historical snow-day rates for similar setups are around 5–15%.\n- Safety analyst: Road and travel risk is low; morning commute impact is minimal, with plows/salt expected to recover the network overnight and normal bus operations recommended.\n- News intel: District is closed for Winter Break; no active snow-day decision and no wave of weather-related closures from neighbors.\nAll four align that Tuesday’s weather is not strong snow-day material and that routine operations (if school were in session) would likely proceed.\n\n2) Disagreements:\n- There are no substantive conflicts. Everyone calls impacts low for Tuesday itself. The only nuance is that the historian allows up to ~15% historical closure rate in rare cases where prior-day damage or drifting lingers, but current safety and news intel do not show widespread outages or catastrophic conditions.\n\n3) Plow timing math:\n- Worst conditions end: late Monday evening (around 23:59 on 12/29).\n- Morning bus window: roughly 06:00–08:00 on Tuesday 12/30.\n- That gives about 6–8+ hours of plow/salt time between the end of the main storm and first buses.\n- Safety expert explicitly states the network should be fully recovered overnight with no new accumulation between midnight and at least mid-afternoon Tuesday.\nThis timing is favorable to having roads in usable condition.\n\n4) Ice risk:\n- Temps stay in the 20s°F with wind chills below zero at times, but there’s no warmup/refreeze cycle or mixed precipitation flagged for Tuesday morning.\n- Safety analyst notes only a moderate risk of hard-pack and slick spots on untreated surfaces, not a glaze/ice-storm scenario.\n- Meteorologist: precip type is snow only, with essentially no Tuesday-morning precip.\nConclusion: no major ice event; just typical frozen/slick winter surfaces Michigan districts routinely handle.\n\n5) Neighboring districts:\n- News intel: no pre-emptive 12/30 snow closures widely reported for nearby Kent County districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, etc.).\n- Many districts are on winter break, reducing the significance of snow-day style decisions. Crucially, there is no signal of a regional “everyone’s closing for weather” move.\nThus, no +15–20% upward adjustment for neighboring closures is warranted.\n\n6) What would make this wrong:\n- An unexpected extension/renewal of warnings into Tuesday morning with heavier-than-forecast lake-effect bands dropping multiple inches right on the commute.\n- A surprise ice component (freezing drizzle or under-modeled freezing rain) creating widespread black ice.\n- Large, unanticipated power outages or serious damage from Monday’s storm not currently evident in the intel.\nThese would all require fresh data; as of the given analyses, they are not indicated.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH DEFINED WEIGHTS)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly supports school being able to run normally if it were in session: <1\" new snow, no morning precip, winds in the 15–20 mph range, and advisory products ending Monday evening. On Michigan’s threshold scale, this is well below 4\" and not a blizzard or ice event. This by itself points to a probability near the bottom of the 5–15% band.\n- Safety (25%): Road scores (7–8/10) and low risk classification confirm that primary and secondary roads plus parking lots should be manageable after overnight work. Morning commute impact is explicitly labeled \"minimal.\" This also argues for a low probability, again in the single digits to low teens.\n- History (20%): Past patterns like this yield closure rates around 5–15%. Historian notes that closures mainly occur when Tuesday inherits unresolved chaos from a much worse Monday, which we do not see evidence of here. Historical context therefore supports a low, but non-zero, probability.\n- News & intelligence (20% – secret weapon): The district is officially closed for Winter Break on Dec 30; there is no active snow-day decision. Neighboring districts are not announcing weather closures for that date. Community sentiment is focused on general winter conditions rather than school-closure campaigns. This strongly reinforces the idea that Tuesday’s conditions are seen as routine winter weather, not closure-level. Because there is also no regional wave of weather closures, there is no upward adjustment from this channel.\n\nQUANTITATIVE DECISION\n- Baseline from meteorology alone, using district thresholds: under 4\" snow and no ice ⇒ 5–15% range. With particularly benign timing and no precip in the commute, this skews toward the low end, around 5–8%.\n- Safety data: no need to nudge upward; if anything it supports staying near ~8% or below.\n- Historical analogs: support ~10% mid-point, but given the explicit present-day safety and road intel is good, we bias slightly below that historical mid-point.\n- News intel: because Rockford is on break and there is no sign of neighbors closing specifically because of Dec 30 weather, there is no +10–20% adjustment. If anything, it confirms that local decision-makers are not treating this as a borderline day.\n\nReconciling these and avoiding unjustified clustering in the middle (40–60%), the best calibrated probability is 8% for a *true* weather-driven snow day, if school were scheduled. This keeps us within the Michigan guidance band (<4\" ⇒ 5–15%) while leaning toward the lowest plausible value, consistent with the strong cross-expert agreement and the lack of any ice/blizzard signal.\n\nNote: In reality, there is 0% chance of a calendar-defined snow day because the district is already on Winter Break. Here, 8% reflects the hypothetical probability of a closure *if* December 30 were a regular school day.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
