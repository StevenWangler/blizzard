  "decision_rationale": "Cross-checking the experts: meteorology + history + infrastructure + news all align on a quiet, dry winter Monday with no new snow/ice load and light winds—an ‘open’ outcome in West Michigan. Safety’s “moderate” label is best interpreted as *patchy* hazard potential (frost/freezing-fog deposition and isolated refreeze on bridge decks/shaded rural roads), not a district-wide travel breakdown; the safety analyst explicitly notes this points more to OPEN-with-caution than a 2-hour delay because temperatures remain below freezing even after sunrise (a delay would not guarantee meaningful improvement). \n\nPotential conflicts were resolved as follows: (1) Visibility anomalies: meteorologist judged the 15:00 “0 mi” reading as likely an artifact; early-night ~1 mi visibility is plausible but winds 6–10 mph limit widespread dense fog during 6–8 AM. (2) Wind chill: web verifier did not produce a credible, date-specific source showing ≤-20°F for Rockford 6–8 AM; therefore extreme-cold automatic closure rules are not triggered. (3) Domino effect: news intel did not confirm neighboring district closures/delays for Feb 9 and found normal scheduling indicators. (4) Power: the only outage signal is a scattered countywide number without Rockford-specific confirmation; that is not enough to drive a closure probability high.\n\nNet: A full closure is unlikely. The realistic “gotcha” is localized black ice on a handful of routes/bridges or a localized facility power outage—usually handled via spot-salting, route adjustments, and caution messaging rather than a district-wide snow day.",
