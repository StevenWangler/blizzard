  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, power, and web verification, the dominant signal for Rockford on Wed 2/11 is a cold but dry, non-event winter day. The forecast shows essentially zero snowfall/precipitation during the school commute, modest NW winds, and wind chills around +13°F—well above Michigan’s dangerous/extreme-cold closure triggers. Infrastructure inputs indicate roads are currently clear with normal winter operations; the only plausible disruption is patchy black ice from refreeze of any residual moisture (bridges, shaded rural connectors, and parking lots), which typically leads to spot salting and cautious driving rather than a district-wide closure. News intelligence introduced a potential conflict (FOX 17 reporting ‘closures amid ongoing snowfall’), but follow-up indicates that story is broad West Michigan context and the accessible closings-page snapshot was not a clean, date-specific confirmation for Wed 2/11; no verified neighboring-district closure announcements were found for that date. Power conditions are quiet with minimal outages. Net: closure is unlikely; the more realistic edge case is a brief delay if pre-dawn scouting finds unexpectedly widespread slickness—currently not supported by the ‘dry roads’ operational quote and the no-precip forecast.",
