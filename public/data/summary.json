  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: Clear, dry, cold day; no new snow or ice, light winds, normal visibility, no alerts; explicitly calls snow/ice closure risk “very low.”\n- Historian: Past Rockford/West Michigan days with this pattern (cold, dry, no storm) almost always have school; analog snow-day rate ~1–5% with high confidence.\n- Safety analyst: Roads and lots scored 9/10, low risk, minimal commute impact; specifically states conditions do NOT warrant cancellation or delay based solely on weather.\n- News/community intel: No closure announcements for Rockford or neighbors, no big storm headlines, no outage or major road-disruption signals, and only casual ‘maybe snow day’ chatter.\nAll four point the same direction: routine winter day, schools open. There are no substantive conflicts to resolve.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- New precip: 0 overnight and 0 during the commute.\n- Sunday’s light freezing rain/snow has already ended, and crews had the evening plus overnight dry time to treat any remaining spots.\n- By a 7:40 AM bus window, plows/salt trucks have had many hours of dry, subfreezing conditions to work; major routes and lots are essentially fully recovered, with only localized slick patches on untreated side streets and sidewalks.\nPlow timing is more than sufficient; there is no active storm competing with them.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology: No ongoing freezing rain or drizzle; just cold, dry air.\n- Safety: Notes a moderate *residual* ice risk (refreeze on untreated surfaces) but still scores roads and lots 9/10 and walking 7/10.\n- There is no evidence of a continuing ice event, power issues, or widespread ‘travel not advised’ messaging.\nSo ice exists only in isolated, manageable spots, not at a level that typically drives a Michigan-wide closure.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD: no announced Monday closures or delays on major outlets or their channels.\n- Local TV and NWS: framing Monday as standard early-December cold, not a storm day.\n- Community sentiment: ‘Wait and see’ and routine caution, not strong confidence in closure.\nPer the instructions, there is no +15–20% bump from neighboring-district closures and no +10–15% bump from an ‘everyone expects a snow day’ vibe.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\n- Meteorology (35%): Extremely low-impact weather (no snow, no ice, no wind, no alerts) pushes probability toward the low single digits.\n- Safety (25%): High road/parking scores and explicit ‘normal operations reasonable’ further reinforce a very low closure risk.\n- History (20%): Analog days show 1–5% closure rates; this keeps the estimate anchored below typical thresholds.\n- News intel (20%): No closures announced, no regional storm, no domino effect; keeps probability near the floor, not boosted.\nCombining these, a 5% probability fits: above 0 to acknowledge residual slick spots and decision noise, but firmly in the Michigan “routine winter day” band (5–15%) and closer to its lower bound given the unanimity.\n\n6. Avoiding Brier-score penalties\n- If school is open (very likely), a 5% prediction yields a small Brier penalty (0.05² = 0.0025).\n- A higher guess (say 15–20%) would badly overestimate risk relative to all four experts and the historical base rate.\nGiven the strong consensus and lack of any brewing storm or closure chatter, committing to 5% is both decisive and statistically justified.\n\nConclusion: Conditions for Rockford on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025 are cold but ordinary for Michigan winter, with no active storm, minimal safety impact, and no closure signals from districts or media. The best calibrated prediction is that school runs on a normal schedule, with a snow/ice day probability around 5%.",
