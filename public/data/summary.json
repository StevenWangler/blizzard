  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, news intel, infrastructure, power, and web verification there is broad agreement: Tuesday morning in Rockford is forecast to be cold and mostly quiet with essentially no accumulating snow and no extreme wind chill. The only substantive conflict is the day-summary label indicating “light freezing rain” versus hourlies showing near-zero precipitation through the morning. The meteorologist clarification explains how trace freezing drizzle can occur under low stratus even when hourly QPF rounds to zero—so a patchy black-ice scenario is plausible, but most likely isolated (bridges/overpasses/untreated secondary roads) rather than widespread.\n\nMichigan districts typically do not close for trace snow or non-extreme cold, and there are no verified neighboring-district closures or official signals suggesting Rockford is preparing to close. Roads/operations are expected to be normal with spot-treatment capacity, and power outages are minimal systemwide with no evidence of a localized surge.\n\nRecommendation: **OPEN with monitoring** (not a full closure). Given the icing-tail risk, the more realistic disruption—if anything—would be a **2-hour delay**, but that scenario appears low-probability without an actual pre-dawn drizzle/black-ice confirmation.",
