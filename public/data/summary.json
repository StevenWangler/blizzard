    "Primary hazard is ICE (trace freezing rain/drizzle ~4–6 AM) with subfreezing temps through bus time → black ice risk on bridges, shaded curves, and untreated secondary/rural roads",
    "Potential very low visibility/freezing fog around 6–8 AM (some data may be artifact, but the setup supports at least pockets of dense fog/low stratus)",
    "Little/no snow and light winds → no plowing/blizzard driver; impacts likely patchy rather than widespread",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays yet and no community ‘buzz’/road reports; FOX17 closings page shows none active at check time",
    "Power outage risk appears low (light winds + very low QPF); closure decision likely transportation-driven, not utility-driven"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Integrating all six inputs: meteorology, history, safety, and infrastructure all agree this is a nuisance-ice/fog setup (not a snowstorm) with the worst timing (4–7 AM). The meteorologist clarifies the liquid is extremely small (trace glaze, not a meaningful accretion event), which in Michigan typically produces spotty slickness rather than system-wide impassability—supporting OPEN as the base case. Safety and infrastructure correctly flag the failure mode: even trace glaze can make secondary/rural bus routes and bridges unexpectedly slick, and the possible freezing fog/very low visibility could tip operations toward a delay.\n\nNews intelligence is a key tiebreaker here and currently points DOWN: no confirmed closures/delays posted yet (FOX17 shows none active) and no community chatter/road-condition reports were found. Power grid risk is also low and not a likely closure driver.\n\nGiven (a) trace-icing magnitude, (b) mid-February ‘winter-ready’ operations, and (c) lack of closure domino signals, a full cancellation remains a minority outcome. However, because ice is high-impact and the peak window aligns with buses, the closure probability is not in the single digits. I land at 24% (close to the group’s ~22% consensus) with the expectation that a 2-hour delay is more likely than a full closure if early road checks find widespread glazing or truly dense fog.",
