  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflict check\n- Meteorology: Indicates a low chance of closure. Temps hover around freezing overnight, rise into mid-30s, with ~0\" snow and mainly rain. Morning (midnight–8 AM) is dry/overcast with maybe mist; heavier rain/light sleet comes 3–8 PM. Bottom line: not a snow-day setup.\n- History: Strongly reinforces that this pattern almost never leads to closures (2–3% historical snow-day rate) in Rockford/GR: rain-dominant, marginal temps, no alerts, no arctic cold. Calls it a classic “raw, rainy, maybe briefly slushy” school day.\n- Safety: Rates primary roads 8/10, secondaries and lots 7/10; morning commute impact minimal, afternoon moderate. Recommends normal in‑person school, with targeted salting and caution for slick spots and wet roads.\n- News/Community Intel: No advisories for Kent County for Jan 13, no Rockford/neighbor closures listed, no social-media buzz, and generic closings pages show no Jan 13 entries. Local forecast language describes a light icy mix later in the day, not a storm-level event.\n\nAll four experts agree: (a) this is not a significant snow or ice storm, (b) morning conditions are generally fine for school, and (c) the higher-impact weather is later in the day. There are no substantive conflicts—only nuance about a \"moderate\" but localized ice formation risk.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Snow/ice accumulation: Models show essentially 0\" snow and no meaningful ice accretion; risk is mainly brief slickness from marginal temps and wet surfaces.\n- Timing: Roads are mainly dry/damp overnight into the morning. Any mist or patchy black ice risk is around the 6–8 AM window but not widespread.\n- Buses start ~6–7 AM; school start ~7:30–8:00 AM. The more intense precip (heavier rain, then light sleet) ramps up around 3 PM and continues to ~7 PM.\n- That leaves essentially unlimited time between the end of anything marginally icy and the morning commute, and the worst conditions come after dismissal when crews can actively treat surfaces. This is not a case where plows need hours to clear 4–8\" of snow; instead it is standard winter wet-road management.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Temperatures: around 31°F early, then into the mid‑30s. That supports possible spotty slickness on bridges, untreated secondary roads, and shaded lots pre‑dawn, but a warming trend reduces risk as the morning progresses.\n- Precip type: \"Mixed\" overall, but specifically rain-dominant with a short light sleet window late afternoon/early evening. No modeled ice accretion and no freezing rain signature.\n- Safety analyst: Flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but still recommends normal school with targeted salting and bus driver awareness. That indicates nuisance to moderate slick spots, not system-wide hazardous ice.\n\nGiven that Michigan thresholds treat 8+\" or true icing as a 60–85% closure setup, the complete absence of accumulating snow and of a true freezing-rain event keeps this day far below typical closure criteria.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news intel\n- Neighboring district closures list: Empty for Jan 13; no entries in closings aggregators, no Rockford or Kent ISD‑area neighbors calling off.\n- NWS and local TV: No current winter weather advisory/warning for Kent County for Jan 13.\n- Community sentiment: \"no_buzz\"—people are not talking about a snow day or major storm.\n\nPer the weighting rules, News Intel is a key factor: if neighbors were closing, we would add 15–20% to the probability, but we have the opposite: zero signals of closure. This strongly supports staying near the low end of the Michigan threshold ranges.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (explicit)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly points to non-event for closures (low hazard in pre‑dawn, worse weather later). If taken alone, this suggests perhaps ~5–10% closure probability, driven only by low‑probability surprise icing.\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as safe enough for normal operations with precautions. Implied closure chance around ~5–10%—only if ice is worse than expected.\n- History (20%): Past analogs show ~2–3% closure rate. This pulls the blended probability down toward the very low single digits.\n- News Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no advisories, no chatter. This behaves like a strong negative signal, keeping us near the historical baseline rather than bumping us up the way active closure lists would.\n\nBlending these: \n- Meteorology: ~8% * 0.35 ≈ 2.8\n- Safety: ~8% * 0.25 ≈ 2.0\n- History: ~3% * 0.20 ≈ 0.6\n- News Intel: ~5% * 0.20 ≈ 1.0\nSum ≈ 6.4%, rounded to a decisive 7% to acknowledge small upside risk from an unexpected earlier or stronger icy mix.\n\n6. Why not higher (e.g., 15–30%)?\n- Michigan closure thresholds emphasize significant snow totals (4–6\"+) or ice/blizzard-level impacts. We have 0\" snow and no ice storm.\n- No winter weather alerts, no neighboring closures, and normal historical behavior in such setups argue strongly against anything in the moderate-probability range.\n- The plow/salt demands are routine; infrastructure is built for this.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nKey failure modes:\n- The light icy mix arrives **several hours earlier** than forecast, creating widespread freezing rain or significant sleet accumulation starting before 5–6 AM rather than mid/late afternoon.\n- Surface temperatures run **1–3°F colder** than forecast, causing a flash ice event even with modest QPF, especially if untreated roads glaze over.\n- A late-day NWS advisory is issued for **freezing rain or significant ice accretion** centered on Kent County.\n- A domino effect of closures develops among neighboring Kent ISD/GR metro districts tonight, signaling a risk perception shift not captured in current data.\nAny of these would justify materially raising the probability into at least the 25–40% range or higher.\n\n8. Final decision\nGiven strong multi-expert agreement, routine winter conditions for Michigan, low historical closure rates for this exact setup, and no peer-district closure signals, the best calibrated forecast is a **7% probability of a snow/ice day** for Rockford Public Schools on Tuesday, January 13, 2026. Normal school operations are expected, with attention to localized slick spots and a wetter, sloppier afternoon commute.",
