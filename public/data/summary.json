  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist, historian, and safety analyst all agree that Monday 1/19 will feature hazardous winter conditions in Rockford: ongoing lake‑effect snow under a Winter Storm Warning, snow‑covered/slippery roads, reduced visibility, and sub‑zero or near‑zero wind chills at times, especially during the morning commute window.\n- All three agree that travel impacts are significant enough that on a *normal* school day, there would be a meaningful chance of a weather‑related closure or at least strong consideration of one.\n- News intelligence agrees that this hazardous weather is occurring over a date already identified as non‑instructional.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There is no real conflict on the *weather itself* or its impacts; the small differences are about degree (historian suggests roughly 30–50% historical snow‑day likelihood in similar setups; safety calls risk ‘high’ and strongly suggests considering closure; meteorology frames it as a meaningful but not guaranteed closure setup).\n- The apparent conflict is conceptual: meteorology/history/safety are evaluating, in abstract, whether conditions are ‘snow‑day caliber,’ while the news intelligence states that Rockford Public Schools is already officially CLOSED to students for MLK Day and PD, explicitly as a planned calendar closure, not a snow day.\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Per the meteorological and safety timelines, snow does **not** cleanly end before the morning; instead, snow continues through the overnight and into/through the morning commute, with the ‘worst conditions’ window from roughly 12:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and specifically severe impacts around 4:00–8:00 AM.\n- That means there is effectively **zero clear plow window** before a hypothetical start of school; crews would be plowing *while* snow continues and visibility varies. For an actual school day this would substantially raise closure/delay probability.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Air temps 7–16°F with wind chills near/below 0°F strongly favor **snow‑ and ice‑covered pavement**.\n- The safety analyst explicitly flags **high ice formation risk**, due to very cold pavement and reduced salt effectiveness, leading to persistent packed snow/ice on roads and in parking lots.\n- So yes, icy conditions are expected, even though the falling precip is snow, not freezing rain. From a road‑safety standpoint this is functionally similar to an ice‑impact scenario.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intelligence shows **no neighboring district closures** reported specifically as weather‑driven for this date, and no regional pattern of emergency snow closures beyond the standard MLK Day observance where applicable.\n- With 0 confirmed neighboring districts closing explicitly *for weather*, there is **no +15–20% probability bump** from regional behavior.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Two main ways:\n  a) If Rockford’s calendar or official communication were misinterpreted and, contrary to the intel, **students were actually scheduled for a normal instructional day** on Jan 19. In that case, using only the weather, history, and safety analyses, a snow day probability in the ~40–60% band could be defensible due to the Winter Storm Warning, ice risk, and bad timing.\n  b) If the district decided to *relabel* the day as an official weather closure for reporting/accounting purposes, even though no students were going to attend anyway. That would be an administrative classification issue, not the usual ‘will kids have school or a snow day?’ decision.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates a solid, travel‑impacting lake‑effect event under a Winter Storm Warning, continuous snow into the commute, and significant visibility and wind‑chill issues. On a normal school day this alone would push toward a moderate snow‑day probability (roughly mid‑range in Michigan terms for a 4–7\" event spread over 24–36 hours).\n- Safety (25% weight): Gives a ‘high’ risk rating, with severe morning commute impacts, high ice formation risk, and explicit advice that districts should strongly consider closure or a delay. Purely on safety grounds, this tilts the probability upward vs. climatology.\n- History (20% weight): For similar patterns, historical snow‑day rates range from 15% to 40%, with the most analogous cases falling around **30–40%**; the historian characterizes this as a ‘moderate rather than high’ conditional probability, emphasizing that West Michigan often stays open in such storms.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, but decisive contextually): Conclusively reports that **Rockford Public Schools are already scheduled to be closed to students for MLK Day and staff PD** on Jan 19, and that this is communicated clearly in multiple official sources. There is no chatter or evidence of a contemplated *additional* weather‑related closure.\n\nSYNTHESIS:\n- If this were a regular instructional Monday with students expected:\n  - Meteorology (35%) + Safety (25%) would support a notably elevated snow‑day probability, perhaps on the order of **45–55%**, with Michigan’s higher thresholds and historical data keeping it below the 60%+ ‘likely closure’ regime.\n- However, the **core question** here is ‘What is the probability of a *snow day* (weather‑caused student cancellation) on 1/19?’ not ‘Is school in session?’ or ‘Are conditions dangerous?’\n- The News Intelligence—our ‘secret weapon’—shows that **students already have the day off for non‑weather reasons**, and all current communication frames it as a standard holiday/PD day. There is no indication the district will reclassify it as a snow day.\n\nGiven that:\n- The baseline probability of a *weather‑driven* cancellation, conditional on already being closed for a holiday, is extremely low.\n- Even very severe weather would not meaningfully increase the odds that the district retroactively or symbolically calls it a ‘snow day’ instead of ‘holiday/PD day’—there is no incentive or pattern supporting that.\n- Neighboring districts are not signaling a special, region‑wide emergency closure beyond normal MLK observances.\n\nTherefore, the **operational snow‑day probability for students** is effectively near zero. To avoid an overconfident 0 that could be wrong if the district did something unusual administratively, I assign:\n\n- **Final snow day probability: 5%**\n- **Confidence: high** (because district documentation and news intel are clear, and only an atypical administrative choice would overturn this).\n\nThis balances:\n- 35% meteorology + 25% safety + 20% history → would suggest ~45–55% if it were a normal school day.\n- 20% news intel + calendar reality → collapses the practical snow‑day probability to near zero because school is not scheduled in the first place.\n\nOn the Michigan threshold scale (<4\", 4–6\", etc.), this event’s **4–7\" over 24–36 hours with lake‑effect** would normally support something in the 35–50% range for a snow day given the timing and ice, but the **pre‑planned MLK closure dominates the decision**, forcing the final probability down regardless of weather severity.\n",
