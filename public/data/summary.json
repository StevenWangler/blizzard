    "Sunday highs in the low–mid 30s°F with some sun/mist promote compaction and melting on treated/main roads",
    "No active snow, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold expected during the Monday morning window—main hazard is refreeze on untreated secondary and residential roads",
    "Historical analogs for West Michigan with similar timing and totals show relatively low snow-day rates, especially when cleanup time exceeds 12–18 hours",
    "Kent County/Rockford have strong snow-removal infrastructure and are culturally accustomed to handling this type of weekend storm without closing on Monday"

  "decision_rationale": "The meteorological, historical, and safety analyses all point to a significant but well-timed weekend storm for Rockford, MI. Heavy snow (6–10\" area-wide) and difficult travel are concentrated from Saturday through early Sunday, with the bulk of accumulation ending by around mid-morning Sunday. After that, conditions transition to mist/freezing fog and then partial clearing, with temperatures rising into the low–mid 30s°F, allowing plows and salt crews essentially the entire day and evening Sunday to clean up primary and secondary routes and school lots.\n\nBy the Monday morning commute, the forecast shows cold and dry weather with temperatures in the 20s°F, no ongoing snow or ice, and winds only in the 10–20 mph range—not enough for blizzard criteria. The main remaining issues will be refreeze, packed snow on some secondary/residential streets, narrowed lanes, and slick spots on hills and shaded areas. These conditions are very typical for early-season storms in West Michigan and generally fall within the operating norms for Rockford and Kent County, which have robust snow-removal infrastructure and a high tolerance for winter weather.\n\nHistorically, similar patterns—weekend storms with heavy snow ending at least 18–24 hours before the Monday commute and no extreme cold—have produced relatively low closure rates (roughly 15–35%), with many districts opening on time. Given the strong local capability and the lack of an active hazard during the commute, the evidence favors a normal school day rather than a full snow day. To be decisive and reflect Michigan’s higher thresholds, I place the probability of a snow day at 22%, leaning clearly toward school being open while still acknowledging some chance of closure if cleanup underperforms or localized drifting/refreeze is worse than anticipated.",
