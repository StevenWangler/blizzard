    "Web Weather Verifier flagged a credible ≤ -20°F wind chill scenario (Weather.com cache shows ~-26°F), which triggers the Extreme Cold Rule and dominates the decision risk even with otherwise quiet weather",
    "No meaningful snow/ice is forecast in the provided meteorological slice (Sun 2/8), so a snow-driven closure is unlikely; main non-cold hazard would be isolated refreeze/black ice",
    "Neighboring districts and Rockford have no posted closure/delay signals in accessible official pages as of Fri 2/6; community sentiment shows “no buzz,” which normally points to staying open",
    "Infrastructure monitor expects roads mostly clear with only patchy refreeze risk; however their data confidence is low and live road-condition layers weren’t accessible",
    "Power outages in Kent County are elevated but not clearly widespread; without Rockford-specific outage polygons/ETRs, power is a low-probability but high-impact wildcard"

  "decision_rationale": "There is a major conflict between the API-based meteorology (quiet, dry; wind chill not extreme) and the Web Weather Verifier (Weather.com shows a much colder ‘feels like,’ including a plausible ~-26°F scenario). Under the NON-NEGOTIABLE extreme cold rules, any credible source showing ≤ -20°F wind chill during 6–8 AM means Rockford-area schools are very likely to close regardless of roads. However, the Weather.com signal is inconsistent across caches/locales (about -17°F vs -26°F), and we do not have a dedicated Monday 6–8 AM NWS/Weather.gov value in the provided packet, so the forecast certainty is not high enough to go straight to 90–95%.\n\nGiven (1) no snow/ice expected to force a closure on its own, (2) no neighboring-district domino effect yet, and (3) only moderate/scattered outage risk—but (4) a safety-significant chance that wind chills are in the -20°F-or-colder range—I’m setting a mid-high probability that reflects the ‘cold-triggered closure’ being the primary path. If Monday morning wind chills verify closer to -17°F (still dangerously cold but above the automatic threshold), Rockford would more likely stay open with caution; if they verify ≤ -20°F, closure odds jump to the 90–95% band.",
