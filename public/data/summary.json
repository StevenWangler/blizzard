  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, power, and news intel there is strong agreement this is *not* a Michigan snow-day setup: no snow accumulation is forecast, winds are modest, and there are no winter storm/ice storm alerts. The only meaningful disagreement was safety’s ‘moderate’ ice risk despite little/no forecast precip at commute time; after clarification, that risk is specifically a *patchy* mechanism (fog deposition/flash-freeze on bridge decks/untreated low-traffic spots), not widespread glazing. In Michigan, patchy hazards plus fog more commonly lead to caution messaging (or at most a delay if early bus checks find multiple icy segments), not a district-wide closure—especially with no confirmed neighboring-district closures and a TV closings page showing no active delays/closures. Power-grid risk appears low given the benign weather profile; live outage confirmation is limited, but there’s no evidence of a regional outage event that would force closure. Net: full closure remains a low-probability tail outcome; the more realistic disruption is a short delay if real-world early-morning spot checks identify unexpected glazing.",
