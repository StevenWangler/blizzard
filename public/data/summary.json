  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- A plowable, significant snow event occurs overnight into Wednesday.\n- Snow is ongoing through the 2–7 AM window, not fully over before buses.\n- Temps hover near freezing (31–36°F), making the snow wet, heavy, and slushy.\n- Visibility is reduced (often 1–2 miles, occasionally worse) during the morning commute with blowing/drifting issues.\n- Travel will be hazardous at least at some level for the 6–8 AM window.\n- There is no classic blizzard or deep‑cold extreme; this is a strong but not historic storm for West Michigan.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- **Snow amount on roads by commute:**\n  - Original meteorological narrative suggested ~10–11\" total day snow with ~8–9\" before commute.\n  - Cross‑check of experts (meteorologist + safety) refined that to **~6–7\" falling 12–7 AM, with ~5–7\" effectively on main roads by 8 AM** due to compaction and treatment.\n  - Safety framing before cross‑check leaned closer to a 10\"+ high‑end impact and implied extensive plow overload; cross‑check shifts that to a still‑significant but more routine 5–7\" main‑road event.\n\n- **Ice severity:**\n  - Safety initially flagged **“high” ice formation risk**.\n  - Cross‑check downgrades this to **localized, moderate glaze/slush refreeze**, especially on lots and side streets, not a widespread crippling ice storm. No strong freezing‑rain signal.\n\n- **Overall disruption framing:**\n  - Meteorological + historical view: heavy but **“challenging but manageable”**, historically **<50% closure odds** for similar marginal‑temp early‑December storms.\n  - Safety view: **“severe risk”** with strong recommendation for closure.\n  - News intel: regional coverage and advisories put Kent County on the **southern/less intense edge**, emphasizing hazardous but not paralyzing travel; no early school closures announced and public sentiment is **uncertain, not closure‑confident**.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- From safety tool clarification:\n  - Heavy, plow‑defeating snow at 0.8–2\"/hr persists from **~12 AM to at least 7 AM**.\n  - Accumulation rates remain >0.25\"/hr through at least 7 AM; only after **8–10 AM** does it transition to lighter snow/blowing with less new accumulation.\n  - Conclusion: **Essentially 0 useful hours** of lull between end of impactful snow and **6:30–7:40 AM** bus window. Cleanup/widening time doesn’t really open until mid‑/late morning.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Temps: **31–36°F**, very humid – classic wet, compacting snow and slush setup.\n- Cross‑check: ICE severity **low–moderate**, not high:\n  - Slush, compaction, and localized refreeze on **untreated surfaces, parking lots, side streets, and hills**.\n  - Main roads likely slushy/slick but **not a district‑wide glassy ice glaze**.\n- So: **No major freezing‑rain/ice storm**, but **enough localized icing** to materially worsen walking, lots, and marginal roads.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel (FOX 17 closings and other sources):\n  - **No active closings or delays** yet for Kent County districts (Rockford, GR, Northview, Comstock Park, Sparta, Cedar Springs, etc.).\n  - No winter storm warnings centered on Kent; stronger advisories and heavier totals are to the **north** (Mason/Manistee/Benzie, etc.).\n  - Community/social sentiment is **“watching the forecast/uncertain”**; not clearly expecting a slam‑dunk snow day.\n- Applying the developer rules:\n  - 0 neighboring closures → **no +15–20% bump** from confirmed closures.\n  - Community not strongly expecting closure → **no +10–15% expectation bump; if anything, this restrains us from over‑forecasting**.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- **Too HIGH a probability (false alarm)** if:\n  - Actual totals in Rockford proper verify toward the low end (e.g., 3–4\" by commute, faster taper 4–5 AM),\n  - Plows over‑perform and have main and many secondary routes in decent shape by 6:30–7:30 AM,\n  - Visibility issues and drifts are localized rather than widespread, and\n  - Superintendent emphasizes Michigan’s higher tolerance, deciding to run school on time or with only a minor delay.\n\n- **Too LOW a probability (miss) if:**\n  - Banding over‑performs and Rockford lands in a heavier corridor (8\"+ on roads by 8 AM instead of 5–7\"),\n  - A thin but impactful ice glaze forms on lots and key bus routes early morning,\n  - Visibility degrades to frequent near‑whiteouts 5–8 AM on rural routes, and\n  - Kent County plows struggle more than expected, prompting broad closures.\n\nGiven the model blend and cross‑check, the **first error mode (too high)** is somewhat more plausible than a surprise crippling storm – hence I avoid going above ~70%.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR INPUTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  - Cross‑checked view: **5–7\" effective accumulation on main roads by 8 AM**, wet snow, no blizzard, but snow still falling and blowing at commute time.\n  - This suggests **meaningful risk but not a guaranteed shutdown**.\n  - Contribution: leans around **45–55% closure odds**.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  - Emphasizes **severe** 6–8 AM conditions: continuous heavy snow, zero plow catch‑up window, hazardous secondary/rural roads, risky parking lots and walking routes.\n  - Strongly recommends closure or at least large delay.\n  - Contribution: pushes probability up to **~75–80%** if taken alone.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  - Analog 1 (6–10\" heavy wet snow, winds, improving visibility by midday): **~60% historical snow‑day rate**.\n  - But added nuance: marginal temps + West Michigan competence + improvement after sunrise usually mean **less than even odds** in early December.\n  - Our case fits **upper end** of ‘challenging but manageable’ – likely **40–55%** from pure climatology.\n\n- News intelligence (20% weight):\n  - No advisories centered on Kent; heavier alerts to the north.\n  - No pre‑announced closures or delays; sentiment is **wait‑and‑see**.\n  - This argues against assuming a near‑certain closure and pulls the blended probability **downward**, perhaps into the **50–60%** range.\n\nCombining these, with explicit weights and adjustments:\n- Start from meteorology/historical blended baseline: ~**50%**.\n- Add safety emphasis on zero plow window, hazardous lots, and rural routes: **+15–20 points → ~65–70%**.\n- Apply news‑intel/community moderation (no neighboring closures, no strong closure expectation): **–3 to –5 points → landing near 65–67%**.\n- Michigan threshold guidance suggests 8\"+ or strong ice should be **60–85%**; we’re marginally below 8\" on most roads but within a 6–8\" plus timing window – that justifies being **in the 60s, not 50s**.\n\nI deliberately avoid the 40–60% ‘shrug’ band because the **plow‑timing and commute overlap** materially raise risk compared with a routine 4–6\" Michigan event. I set the final number at **68%** to reflect:\n- Clearly more likely than not, but\n- Allowing for the substantial chance that Rockford leans on its high snow tolerance and manages an in‑person day.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
