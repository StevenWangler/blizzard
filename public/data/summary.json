    "Primary hazard is only *patchy/conditional* refreeze/black ice on bridges, ramps, shaded rural roads, and parking lots—typically managed with spot treatment and cautious driving, not district-wide closure",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closure wave or Rockford Public Schools announcement; community buzz appears minimal",
    "Road network expected to be generally clear by bus time; power grid shows no outage event signal (very low routine outage levels, Kent County shows 0 in one aggregator snapshot)"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Integrating all six inputs, the base case is strongly “OPEN.” Meteorology, safety, history, and infrastructure all agree there is no storm-driven trigger: no snowfall, no measurable precip, good visibility, and only modest winds. The only meaningful risk discussed is patchy black ice from refreeze of *pre-existing* moisture—this is real but typically localized and handled via spot salting plus slower bus operations, making a full closure unlikely in Michigan.\n\nThe one apparent conflict is the news layer highlighting KCRC pretreating for an ‘ice storm’/freezing precip. Follow-up checking did not find time-stamped confirmation that this is specifically for Rockford during the Tue Feb 10 morning window, and no neighboring district closures/delays were confirmed. The Web Weather Verifier also found no extreme wind chill and no accumulating snow, and did not confirm an active, Rockford-specific freezing-precip event in the 6–8 AM window. With no closure domino effect, no NWS warning signal presented here, and no power-outage concerns, the rational Brier-optimized forecast remains low but non-zero to account for the tail risk that a thin glaze/refreeze becomes more widespread than expected at dawn.\n\nRecommendation: Schools should plan to OPEN, with a contingency for a 2-hour delay if dawn road checks find widespread glazing on secondary/rural routes and parking lots.",
