  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Significant snow event: All agree on a substantial storm impacting Rockford from late night into Wednesday with several inches of accumulation.\n- Timing: Heaviest conditions run overnight through the morning, with the worst travel and visibility in the 3–8 AM window.\n- Plow struggle window: All agree there is no clean multi‑hour lull before school; crews will be plowing actively through the commute.\n- Main hazard: Snow, slush, and visibility—not a major freezing‑rain or extreme‑cold event.\n- Morning vs. afternoon: Morning is the big problem. Conditions improve notably by early afternoon with roads gradually catching up.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Snow amount and geographic focus:\n  • Meteorologist & safety analyst (using the local, Rockford‑focused forecast) see ~10–11\" calendar‑day total with ~6–8\" already down by daybreak and heavy ongoing rates through 7–8 AM.\n  • News intel, reflecting NWS/TV/regional coverage, emphasizes that the storm’s advisory/warning focus is more on mid‑ and northern‑Michigan, with Kent County south of I‑96 expected to mix with rain and see more modest totals (2–4\" typical in some writeups).\n- Impact severity framing:\n  • Meteorology and safety call this a high‑impact, snow‑day‑type setup for Rockford given timing and totals.\n  • Historical analysis calls it borderline‑to‑likely: not automatic, but clearly elevated snow‑day odds.\n  • News/community signals currently show no strong pre‑closure movement and no Winter Storm Warning bullseye on Kent County, implying broader public forecasts may be less aggressive than our local, high‑QPF scenario.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM):\n- Meteorologist: Accumulating snow ≥0.5\"/hr persists until about 8–9 AM EST. Rates drop below ~0.5\"/hr around 7–8 AM.\n- Safety analyst: Heavy accumulating snow from ~2 AM through at least 6–7 AM, with only a marginal easing 6:30–7:30 AM and strong blowing snow thereafter.\n- That means there is effectively 0–1 hour of only slightly lighter snow before first bell, and even that window is still within a heavy/blowing snow regime. There is no 2–3 hour cleanup gap.\n- So plow timing math: \"catch‑up\" hours before 7:40 AM ≈ 0–1 hour at best; most routes are being actively re‑covered during the 5–7 AM decision and bus window.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorologist: Explicitly low icing severity; profiles favor almost all snow, temps 31–36°F, and no significant freezing drizzle during 3–8 AM.\n- Safety analyst: Notes moderate ice formation risk from refreezing later, but during the commute the main issue is heavy, wet snow and slush.\n- News intel: Regional writeups mention rain/mix south of I‑96, but in the crucial 3–8 AM window for Rockford, the high‑resolution local forecast still shows primarily wet snow, not a classic glaze event.\n- Conclusion: No major glaze ice in the pre‑dawn window. This is a heavy, wet snow event; that keeps risk high, but not \"ice‑storm\" category.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel confirms:\n  • As of late evening Dec 9, no closures/delays announced for Rockford or neighboring Kent ISD districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview).\n  • FOX 17 closings list: no active closings or delays.\n  • No Kent‑specific Winter Storm Warning headline; advisory/warning messaging is focused more north and east.\n- Therefore:\n  • 0 neighboring districts closed at this time.\n  • Per instructions, I do NOT apply the +15–20% boost for confirmed multi‑district closures.\n  • Community sentiment is \"uncertain\" rather than strongly expecting a snow day, so no 10–15% sentiment bump either.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Ways I could \"overshoot\" (probability too high):\n  • The broader NWS/TV guidance is closer to reality than the very snowy local model: storm track shifts just enough that Rockford mixes with rain earlier and totals are more like 3–5\" with only moderate rates during 3–6 AM.\n  • Plows, helped by marginal temps, keep main roads mainly wet/slushy and passable; administrators see roads as workable at 4–5 AM and choose to open, perhaps with minor delays.\n  • Visibility during 6–8 AM ends up better than forecast, with less blowing/drifting than feared.\n- Ways I could \"undershoot\" (probability too low):\n  • The higher‑end local forecast verifies: 6–8\" by daybreak, heavy snow still falling at 5–7 AM, and strong blowing/drifting leading to numerous rural trouble spots.\n  • NWS upgrades Kent County to an advisory or warning overnight, and multiple districts close, which historically pushes Rockford strongly toward closure.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Calls this a \"classic high‑impact snow day setup\" for Rockford with ongoing heavy snow through the commute, 8–10\"+ totals, and poor visibility.\n  • On its own, this would suggest roughly 80–85% snow‑day odds, given Michigan thresholds (8+\" with bad timing).\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Rates risk as \"severe,\" says there is essentially no true pre‑commute lull, and explicitly states AM bus risk is high enough to justify full closure over a 2‑hour delay.\n  • On its own, that implies perhaps 75–85% odds of at least a closure attempt, not just a delay.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • For similar patterns (6–10\" with worst conditions 2–7 AM), historical snow‑day rate is about 60%.\n  • Describes this setup as borderline‑to‑likely but not automatic.\n  • On its own, I’d place odds around 55–65%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight; \"secret weapon\"):\n  • No neighboring pre‑announced closures, no Kent‑specific warning, and regional NWS interpretation suggesting less dramatic totals and more mixing near/south of I‑96.\n  • Community sentiment is \"uncertain,\" not \"we’re definitely off tomorrow.\"\n  • Per your rules, this prevents the +15–20% or +10–15% upward adjustment. In fact, it nudges me toward the lower end of what the physical‑science experts suggest.\n  • On its own, news intel would suggest something like 40–55% odds—messy but not clearly crippling in mainstream forecasts.\n\nSYNTHESIS TO A SINGLE PROBABILITY\n1. Start from meteorology + safety (60% combined weight):\n   - Both strongly favor closure. A reasonable blended starting point from just these two is about 82%.\n2. Adjust with historical patterns (20% weight):\n   - History at ~60% pulls that 82% down: 82 * 0.8 + 60 * 0.2 ≈ 77.6%.\n3. Apply news intelligence (20% weight & threshold rules):\n   - News intel does NOT justify a positive bump (no neighboring closures, no strong community expectation).\n   - It instead argues for leaning slightly conservative: keep probability on the lower side of the \"8+ inches OR ice\" band (60–85%).\n   - That trims the blended result just slightly to about 75–78%.\n\nGiven the Michigan threshold guidance:\n- 8+ inches OR ice = 60–85% domain.\n- This storm, as modeled locally, clearly belongs in that category via snow volume and timing, even without major ice.\n- Because of the discrepancy between the local high‑snow model and broader NWS/TV guidance, I avoid going to the top of that band.\n\nFinal choice: 78% snow‑day probability\n- This stays decisively out of the 40–60% no‑man’s‑land and reflects that a closure is more likely than not, but not a lock.\n- It acknowledges:\n  • Strong operational reasons to cancel (ongoing heavy snow at commute time, severe safety assessment), and\n  • The possibility that regional forecasts are more conservative, leading some decision‑makers to try to open.\n\nRECOMMENDED OPERATIONAL DECISION\n- Primary recommendation: **Full closure for Rockford Public Schools on Wed, Dec 10, 2025.**\n  • Justification: Severe morning commute risk for buses and student drivers; heavy wet snow with poor visibility and no substantial pre‑commute lull; rural and secondary routes present high risk of stuck buses/vehicles and reduced emergency access.\n- Secondary (if district is highly averse to closing): A **2‑hour delay** is a distant fallback but is *not* favored by the safety analysis, since conditions remain high‑risk even with a later start.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
