  "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1) What do all four experts agree on?\n- Meteorologist: No accumulating snow, no active storm, temps mid-20s to low 30s, primary issue is fog/freezing fog later.\n- Historian: This setup matches routine winter school days that almost always stay open; closure-level events usually need heavy snow, real ice storm, or extreme cold – none present.\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely dry/packed with existing snow, low overall risk, minimal morning commute impact, normal operations recommended.\n- News intel: District explicitly plans to resume Jan 5, no storm headlines or closure chatter, no neighboring districts closing.\n\nConsensus: Routine Michigan winter day with minor hazards (patchy slick spots, some fog), not a snow-day pattern.\n\n2) Where do they disagree?\n- There is no substantive conflict. The meteorologist flags \"moderate\" fog travel hazard; safety frames fog/freezing fog as mainly an evening concern with only patchy slick spots and recommends normal opening. Both still land on low closure risk. No expert suggests moderate or high closure probability.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from worst conditions to 7:40 AM)\n- Safety timing: worst conditions 5–9 AM, but explicitly notes no new precip from midnight through morning commute and minimal commute impact.\n- That implies any needed road work overnight is just routine maintenance on existing snowpack/spot salting.\n- With no new snow and temps ~28–30°F at 6–8 AM, crews don’t need major plow time; roads should already be in good shape.\n- Effective \"storm end\" is well before midnight (since no new storm), giving well over 7–8+ hours before the 7:40 AM start – excellent clearance window.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice?\n- No modeled freezing rain or ice storm; precip type note of “freezing_rain” is not paired with any accumulation and the text forecast is 0\" precip.\n- The only ice risk is patchy black ice from residual moisture/refreeze and localized freezing fog, mainly on bridges/untreated spots.\n- That is a \"caution\" level, not the kind of widespread glazing that drives Michigan closures.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel: neighboring_district_closures: [] and no regional closure chatter.\n- No districts have preemptively closed or signaled major concern; therefore no +15–20% adjustment from regional closures.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- A surprise overnight freezing drizzle/freezing rain event that is not currently modeled, leading to widespread glazing on all roads by 4–7 AM.\n- Fog becoming much denser and more widespread than forecast right at commute time, severely reducing visibility while also causing significant ice on roads and sidewalks.\n- A last-minute forecast upgrade Sunday night indicating a fast-developing system bringing accumulating snow or ice during the commute.\n\nGiven current data, these are low-probability but non-zero tail risks, which is why I don’t go all the way down to 1–2%.\n\n2. WEIGHTING EACH EXPERT (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear: 0\" snow, no active precip during school hours, temps near freezing, moderate wind, main hazard is localized fog/freezing fog later in the day. This alone suggests a very low closure chance (~3–5%) for Michigan.\n- Safety (25%): Roads scored 8–9/10, risk level \"low\", morning impact \"minimal\", and explicit recommendation for normal opening. This strongly backs a sub-5–10% closure probability.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs give 2–5% closure rates. Seasonal context notes this is quieter and milder than typical closure days. This points near the low single digits.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Secret weapon. Official district message is firmly “school resumes Monday, Jan 5” with no caveats. No neighboring closures, no community buzz, and no emergency communications. This strongly favors the base probability staying at the low end, not bumped up.\n\nNo neighboring districts closed → no +15–20% upward adjustment.\nCommunity sentiment is \"no_buzz\" rather than “this is nothing” bragging, but the absence of concern still leans us toward the low side of any reasonable range.\n\n3. PROBABILITY DECISION & THRESHOLDS\n- Michigan thresholds emphasize that real closure probability jumps only with 8+ inches of snow, true ice, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold. None are present:\n  - Snow: 0\" forecast\n  - Ice storm: none; only patchy black ice/freezing fog risk\n  - Wind: 10–13 mph, no blowing/drifting issues\n  - Cold: wind chills uncomfortable but nowhere near -15°F criteria\n- Historical analog closure rate: ~2–5%\n- Meteorology + safety combined strongly suggest the lower bound of that range.\n\nTo stay decisive and avoid the 40–60% no-man’s land, I set:\n- Final snow day probability: 4%\n\nThis is slightly above the absolute minimum to account for low-probability surprises (unmodeled freezing drizzle or much worse-than-expected fog), but still very clearly in the “school almost certainly opens” regime.\n\nConfidence: High\n- All four lines of evidence point the same way, and there are no conflicting expert signals.\n- The only plausible failure mode involves an unexpected, currently unforecast ice event.\n\n4. SUMMARY\n- Expected outcome: Rockford Public Schools open on time Monday, January 5, 2026.\n- No delay, no closure based on current data.\n- Continue to monitor Sunday night updates in case of any last-minute change involving freezing drizzle or denser-than-expected morning fog.",
