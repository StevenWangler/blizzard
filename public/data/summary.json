  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorology: Dry, cold, breezy, no snow/ice, no alerts, typical winter day; explicitly calls snow-day risk \"very low.\"\n- Safety: Roads and travel rated safe (8–9/10), only localized black-ice risk, and explicitly recommends a normal, on-time start.\n- History: Very similar past patterns in Rockford show only about a 1–3% snow-day rate; districts almost never close under dry-road, non-extreme-cold conditions.\n- News/Intel: No closure wave, no alerts from Rockford Public Schools, no neighboring districts announcing closures, routine winter messaging from media and road agencies.\nAll four domains independently point toward school being in session. There are no material conflicts among the experts.\n\n2. Where they might differ:\n- Meteorology notes essentially zero precip; news intel mentions a general media phrase \"chance of light snow showers\" in a broader regional context. The detailed meteorological forecast for Rockford itself still shows no meaningful overnight/morning accumulation or active storm. This is a minor wording difference, not a substantive forecast conflict.\n- Safety flags only a moderate risk of isolated black ice due to residual moisture and subfreezing temperatures, but still assigns very good road scores and low overall risk.\nNet: No serious disagreement – just nuance about small, localized slick spots.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Snow probability overnight and in the morning is 0; total snowfall forecast is 0\". That means no new accumulation requiring plow operations.\n- Worst conditions window (per safety) is 00:00–08:00, but those are cold/dry conditions, not active precip.\n- With no new snow to clear, plow timing relative to a 7:40 AM start is effectively a non-factor; crews are on routine winter maintenance, not catch-up from a storm.\n\n4. Ice risk:\n- Temps: low–mid 20s°F in the early morning, rising toward freezing later; 24 straight hours below freezing supports potential refreeze in any wet spots.\n- Safety labels ice-formation risk as \"moderate\" but still rates roads 8–9/10 and calls commute impact \"minimal.\"\n- Meteorology: no new freezing rain or drizzle; only patchy mist/haze at times with visibility usually several miles.\n- History: Past cases with only patchy black ice and no active storm still very rarely trigger system-wide closures.\nConclusion: There is some localized black-ice potential on bridges/curves/parking lots, but not the widespread, high-impact icing that typically forces closures or delays in Kent County.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals:\n- News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD: no pre-announced closures or delays.\n- West Michigan school closing boards show no developing closure wave for Dec. 3.\n- Rockford Public Schools website: no alerts, no \"monitoring weather\" language, calendar shows a normal day.\n- Road commission and MDOT: routine winter maintenance, no special hazard advisories.\n- Social media: no strong \"snow day incoming\" sentiment; people are treating this as ordinary early-December weather.\nSince 3+ neighboring districts closing would warrant a +15–20% upward adjustment, the absence of any neighboring closures or strong community expectation justifies keeping the probability at the very low end.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong:\n- An unforecast overnight event: e.g., an unexpected band of freezing drizzle or snow develops after 10 PM, creating widespread black ice and significantly worse road conditions than currently modeled.\n- A surprise operational issue: a major power outage hitting multiple school buildings overnight or early morning, or a major traffic/road closure affecting key routes.\n- A cold mis-forecast: if wind chills plunge much lower than expected (toward -15°F or colder) and the district applies a stricter cold policy than typical history suggests.\nAt present, none of these are indicated by the data or news intel; they remain low-probability tail risks.\n\n7. Weighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates no storm and no measurable precip; assigns very low risk. This heavily anchors the prediction at the low end.\n- Safety (25%): Confirms roads and travel conditions are safe with only isolated concerns and explicitly recommends normal operations. This reinforces a low closure probability.\n- History (20%): Similar patterns historically close only about 1–3% of the time, aligning with the current 3% estimate and supporting high confidence.\n- News Intelligence (20% – secret weapon): Finds no neighboring closures, no district alerts, and normal community behavior. Since there is no closure wave, no upward adjustment is applied; if anything, this keeps us near the historical base rate rather than bumping higher.\n\n8. Final decision and calibration:\n- Michigan thresholds: With 0\" new snow and no ice storm, we are below even the \"<4\" snow\" baseline of 5–15%. Historical and intel-based evidence argue for an even lower figure because there isn't even minor accumulation – just cold.\n- Brier-score mindset: Using a 3% probability reflects that closures under these conditions are not impossible (surprise ice/power issues), but they are rare. The experts largely agree, and there are no conflicting signals that would justify a mid-range (40–60%) or even low-mid (15–30%) probability.\nTherefore, I set the snow-day probability at 3% with high confidence, anticipating a normal school day on Wednesday, December 3, 2025.",
