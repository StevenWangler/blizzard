  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: (a) no meaningful accumulating snow Wednesday; (b) primary hazard is ice/refreeze/black ice during the pre-dawn to early-morning window; (c) main highways/arterials likely treated, but residential/secondary roads and lots are the limiting factor; (d) wind chill is not at the <=-20F near-automatic threshold; (e) power outages are not widespread.\n2) Disagreements: precip-type/timing (WeatherAPI flags light freezing rain around 05:00–06:00; Weather.com shows mostly cloudy). This matters for how widespread/rapid the glaze becomes, but both paths still support slick spots given sub-freezing temps and prior-day impacts.\n3) Plow timing math: ‘Snow end’ is less relevant than ice/refreeze. Infrastructure indicates residential streets are not expected to be fully serviced before bus routes; that aligns with safety’s high ice-formation risk through ~07:00. Even if arterials are passable by ~06:30, bus routes still face subdivision streets/stop approaches.\n4) Any ice? YES—multiple experts flag high ice risk via refreeze and potential freezing drizzle; even patchy black ice can be closure-level when it coincides with buses.\n5) Neighboring districts: Now confirmed strong—FOX 17 lists Rockford Public Schools CLOSED for Wed Jan 28, and also lists Forest Hills and Kentwood closed (3+ area closures signal per your rubric).\n6) Power outages: Consumers systemwide outages extremely low; no strong outage-driven closure signal.\n7) Wind chill verification: Cross-sources show cold but above the -20F trigger.\n8) What would make me wrong? If the FOX 17 closings list were erroneous/outdated or Rockford reversed to ‘open/delay,’ or if conditions ended up much better (no glaze + residential roads unexpectedly clear). Given the explicit listing of Rockford as CLOSED, the dominant risk is being underconfident, not overconfident.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% (supports ice/refreeze window but low QPF), Safety 25% (high ice risk during commute on secondary roads), History 15% (delay-leaning analogs), News Intel 15% (OVERRIDE-UP: confirmed Rockford listed closed + multiple nearby closures), Infrastructure 10% (residential lag), Power 5% (no outage driver), Web verifier 5% (no -20F trigger; some precip-type uncertainty). The confirmed closure signals from News Intel plus the commute-window ice risk push this from the earlier 28% ‘pre-decision’ estimate to a high likelihood of closure.",
