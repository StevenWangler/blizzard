  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Meteorologist: Calls conditions routine winter weather with no accumulating snow or ice, and explicitly states snow day probability is very low.\n- Historian: Finds closely matching past patterns with only ~1–3% closure rates, high confidence that schools almost always stay open in similar setups.\n- Safety analyst: Rates primary and secondary roads 8–9/10, parking lots 8/10, with only moderate risk from patchy black ice and mist; clearly recommends a regular school day, at most a possible short delay only if overnight conditions are worse than forecast.\n- News & intel: No official Rockford or neighboring‑district closure chatter, no road commission or MDOT severe warnings, no social‑media buzz, and normal event planning.\n\nAll four point the same way: routine winter day, schools open. There are no meaningful conflicts—only a slight emphasis difference where the safety analyst flags moderate early‑morning caution while meteorology frames the whole day as low‑impact.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- No new snow is forecast overnight, so there is effectively no plow backlog.\n- Worst‑conditions window is listed as 05:00–09:00 with patchy mist/fog and possible isolated black ice, not active accumulation.\n- With bare or mostly bare pavement and standard overnight salting, road crews are not racing a storm; they are just maintaining surfaces through a cold, humid morning.\n- Time from any minor early‑morning slickness to first bell (~7:40 AM) is handled by routine salt applications rather than full plowing cycles.\nPlow timing therefore strongly favors holding school: there is no scenario where heavy snow is still falling into the commute.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorologist: No freezing rain signal, and no measurable precip. Mentions mist and humidity but specifically notes no glazing issues expected with winds drying surfaces.\n- Historian: Notes that similar prior days with only very light icing the day before and dry conditions by morning almost never produce next‑day closures.\n- Safety analyst: Describes ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but in practical terms limits it to patchy black ice on untreated spots (bridges, side streets, lots). This is something Michigan districts regularly handle with targeted salting, not system‑wide closings.\nConclusion: There is *some* localized ice potential, but not a broad ice event. That is not enough to move into significant closure territory.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- Rockford: No alerts, no pre‑announced delays or e‑learning; calendar shows normal school operations.\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): No announcements of closure or concern, and no TV/ISD style closing cascades.\n- Community intel: \"No_buzz\" on social media; no power outage clusters, no major event cancellations tied to weather.\nThis not only fails to trigger the +15–20% bump for neighboring closures; it actively supports staying near the lower bound of historical risk.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly favors no closure. Contributes roughly a 3–4% implied risk (mostly from generic uncertainty, not specific hazards).\n- Safety (25%): Moderate early risk but clear statement that a regular school day is appropriate, with only a contingency for a short delay if conditions surprise to the downside. Contributes around 5–8% risk, pulling slightly above zero due to black‑ice potential.\n- History (20%): Puts the baseline at about 1–3% based on past analogs; I treat that as a stabilizing anchor near the bottom of the range.\n- News & intelligence (20%): No closures, no alerts, no buzz. That supports staying at or slightly below the historical analog rate instead of raising it.\nCombining these, the weighted expectation clusters in the low single digits. Given the Michigan threshold guidance (<4\" and no ice storm = 5–15% typical), this event is *even milder* because there is zero accumulation, so it justifies dipping slightly under that band.\n\n6. Michigan threshold framework\n- Snow: 0\" forecast, so well below the 4\" minimum that normally even starts the 5–15% band.\n- Ice: No freezing rain or widespread glaze, just localized black‑ice risk.\n- Wind/cold: Wind chills in the teens, far from extreme‑cold cancellation triggers (around -15°F or lower at bus times).\n- Blizzard/alerts: None.\nBy the district’s own typical behavior, this is a routine winter commute with standard caution, not a closure candidate.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes are:\n- Forecast bust toward *widespread* freezing drizzle overnight, creating a significant, unanticipated glaze on roads and sidewalks.\n- Unforeseen dense fog dropping visibility well below 1/4 mile across much of the district right at bus time.\n- A surprise localized power outage or infrastructure issue unrelated to weather.\nCurrent expert analyses and intel do not support these as likely, but they justify keeping the probability above 0 rather than absolute certainty.\n\nPutting all of this together, a 4% snow‑day probability is appropriate: it aligns with historical closure rates for nearly identical patterns, is consistent with every expert’s direction, respects Michigan’s relatively high tolerance for winter driving, and should produce a strong Brier score if schools indeed open as expected.",
