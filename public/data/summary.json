  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflict check\n- Meteorology: Calls for a dry day with no snow or freezing rain and only patchy fog/freezing fog issues, especially later in the day. Explicitly rates closure probability as near 0%.\n- Safety: Rates road and travel risk low; morning commute impact minimal; recommends normal operations with standard winter caution.\n- History: For similar patterns (dry, around freezing, no new snow or ice, modest winds), historical snow‑day rates are 1–3% with high confidence; closures in this region usually require heavy new snow, ice, or extreme cold.\n- News/Intel: Rockford Public Schools and neighboring districts show no weather alerts or closure hints for Jan 5; all messaging says school resumes that day. No media drumbeat or social media push toward closure.\nThese four sources are aligned: none indicate a meaningful chance of closure given current data. There are no material conflicts to resolve.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total new snow: 0\" forecast through the overnight and morning.\n- With no accumulation, plow timing is essentially a non‑factor. Standard overnight salting/pre‑treatment for existing packed snow and possible slick spots is sufficient.\n- Safety explicitly notes normal bus operations and minimal commute impact from 6–8 AM.\nEffective hours from any minor overnight dampness to first bell are ample, and conditions do not resemble a plow‑limited event.\n\n3. Ice risk assessment\n- Meteorology: Precip type shows \"mixed\" in metadata but with 0.00\" QPF and 0% precip probability; practically, that means no active freezing rain or drizzle during critical hours.\n- Fog/freezing fog: Possible late afternoon/evening into night, which can create localized black ice on untreated surfaces, especially in valleys.\n- Safety: Flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but still rates driving conditions 8/10 and morning commute impact minimal; emphasis is on evening visibility and localized slick spots, not a widespread glaze.\n- Historically, such patchy freezing fog without a bona fide ice storm rarely produces full‑district closures in Kent County.\nNet: There is some localized ice potential, but not of the scale or timing that typically drives a snow day.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior and community signals\n- News intel: No neighboring Kent ISD districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) are announcing closures or pre‑flagging Jan 5 as problematic.\n- Rockford’s official channels are straightforward: winter break ends and school resumes Jan 5, with no caveats.\n- Community sentiment is described as \"uncertain\" but without any strong, organized push toward closure; coverage emphasizes a past storm around New Year’s rather than an impending Jan 5 hazard.\nGiven the rules: no neighboring closures → no upward adjustment. Community isn’t saying \"this is nothing\" explicitly, but institutional behavior clearly treats Jan 5 as routine.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Zero new snow/ice + typical cold → strongly favors school. I treat this as the dominant signal.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, normal operations, minimal morning impact → reinforces a very low closure probability.\n- History (20%): Analog days have ~1–3% closure rate; I anchor the base probability in this band.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closure chatter, clear \"school resumes\" messaging, and no neighboring districts moving toward closure → supports staying at the very low end of probabilities.\nCombining these, I start near 2–3% based on historical analogs, then confirm via meteorology/safety that there’s no hidden hazard warranting a bump. News/Intel provides no reason for an upward adjustment and subtly supports staying low, so I land at 2%.\n\n6. Why not higher?\n- Michigan thresholds: With 0\" new snow and no active ice storm, we’re below even the lowest (<4\") bracket that would justify 5–15% due to snow. The only hazard is fog/patchy ice later in the day.\n- No blizzard conditions, no strong winds, no dangerous wind chills, and no infrastructure impacts (power outages, major closures) reported for Rockford.\n- Historical and local practice: Kent County and Rockford run school in far worse winter conditions than what is forecast for this day.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nI would be wrong (underestimated closure probability) if one of these occurs:\n- A forecast bust introduces unexpected overnight freezing drizzle or a light but poorly timed ice event before dawn, glazing main roads and lots.\n- A last‑minute dense freezing fog event severely reduces visibility and creates widespread black ice in a way not currently modeled, leading to multiple serious accidents before the decision time.\n- A surprise lake‑effect band sets up specifically over Rockford/Kent County overnight, dropping several inches of snow (4–8\"+) right around the commute.\n- Infrastructure issues such as a localized but significant power outage in the district emerge, unrelated to the present forecast.\nGiven current data, these are low‑probability contingencies.\n\n8. Final determination\nAll four expert domains independently and jointly support school operating on a normal schedule. There is no significant snow, no true ice storm, and only localized, mainly evening fog/black ice risk. Neighboring districts and official communications are treating January 5 as a routine return from break.\nTherefore, I assess the snow day (full closure) probability at approximately 2%, with high confidence that Rockford Public Schools will be open on Monday, January 5, 2026.",
