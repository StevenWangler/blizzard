  "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON\n- Meteorologist & cross-check: Cold, dry, and quiet in Rockford from midnight through the Thursday morning commute. No additional accumulating snow, 0% precip in the 4–8 a.m. window, visibility ~6 miles, winds 10–15 mph.\n- Safety analyst: Worst conditions were Wednesday 06:00–23:00. By early Thursday, roads benefit from 7.5–8.5 hours of cleanup time with no new precip. Primary and bus routes are expected to be in good shape; risk level is low.\n- Historian: Days that are cold but dry, with the storm already past and no new advisory over the district, almost always have school. Historical snow-day rates for these analogs are ~5–10%.\n- News intel: As of mid–late Wednesday evening, no Rockford or neighboring Kent County districts have posted Thursday closures or delays. Community chatter is watchful but not convinced a snow day is coming.\n\nSo all four agree: no active storm Thursday morning, no major new hazard emerging overnight, and a generally low likelihood of closure.\n\n2. WHERE THEY DISAGREE\n- The only tension is between:\n  • Meteorology/Safety/History → clearly low risk for Rockford itself.\n  • A regional independent weather site → says parts of West Michigan may see flash-freeze issues and school disruptions Thursday.\n- Tools + cross-check show that the regional concern targets zones mainly north/west of a Grand Haven–Reed City line and other pockets farther south/west. When zoomed in to Rockford, hourly forecast data do NOT show those problems: temps are already well below freezing and steady (not crashing through 32°F), and there is no new precip to freeze.\n- Therefore, the regional discussion is not in real conflict—it is simply less localized. The precise Rockford forecast and safety analysis win out.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions end: ~23:00 Wed 1/14.\n- First bus departures: ~06:30 Thu 1/15; first school start ~07:40.\n- That gives about 7.5–8.5 hours of dry, subfreezing time for plow and salt operations.\n- Safety analyst’s professional judgment: In West Michigan, that is typically enough for Kent County to return primary and bus routes to near-normal winter condition when there is no new snow or ice overnight. Remaining issues are spotty slick patches on secondary streets, bridges, and shaded areas—manageable with caution, not cancellation-level.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE?\n- Meteorology & cross-check: No new freezing rain or snow is expected overnight; temps remain cold (upper teens), so this is not a fresh flash-freeze event but rather a long-duration cold period.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk is rated “moderate” solely due to refreeze of Wednesday’s moisture on untreated surfaces (parking lots, sidewalks, some neighborhood streets). Driving and walking scores (8 and 7 out of 10) indicate manageable conditions.\n- Crucially, there is no indication of glaze ice or widespread black-ice conditions that would make roads effectively unplowable or dramatically increase crash risk. This is standard post-storm Michigan winter, not a major ice event.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel re-check (18:15–22:30 Wed):\n  • Rockford: No Thursday closure or delay posted; Jan 15 remains a normal school day on the calendar.\n  • Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, and other nearby Kent County districts (Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview): No public Thursday closures/delays found.\n- Threshold rule: 3+ neighboring districts closed would warrant a +15–20% bump. Instead, we have zero confirmed neighbors closing and no strong public expectation of closure.\n- Therefore, no upward adjustment from neighboring district actions is justified.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nKey ways this prediction could fail:\n- The localized forecast is wrong and an unmodeled lake-effect band sets up directly over Rockford before dawn, dumping several inches during the commute. This would sharply increase hazard and could push the district toward closure or delay.\n- Late-breaking reports of widespread ice (e.g., surprise freezing drizzle or a true flash-freeze on wet roads) emerge overnight, leading superintendents to cancel despite earlier quiet forecasts.\n- A non-weather operational issue (major bus fleet mechanical failure in the cold, large power outages, or building problems) forces closure unrelated to the road/meteorological analysis.\n\nGiven the strong agreement across meteorology, safety, and historical analogs, plus the lack of closure signals from neighboring districts, these failure modes are possible but unlikely.\n\nWEIGHTING THE EXPERTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates essentially 0\" new snow, no active precip, stable subfreezing temps, and no advisory over Rockford. This strongly supports a very low closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Rates road and travel risk as low, with 7.5–8.5 hours of cleanup. Concludes weather/roads alone would not justify a snow day.\n- History (20%): Analog days have only about 5–10% closure rates in West Michigan. This keeps probability on the very low side.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Secret-weapon factor. Here, it actually reinforces a low probability: no announcements, no neighboring closures, and no strong community consensus expecting a Rockford snow day. The independent regional forecast talks about elevated risk in parts of the area but, when cross-checked against local data, that risk is not manifesting in Rockford itself.\n\nNUMERICAL DECISION\n- Baseline from Michigan thresholds: 0\" new snow and no ice storm → within the routine winter range; normally 5–15%.\n- Historical analogs lean toward the low end of that range (~5–10%).\n- No neighboring-district-closure bump applies (0 districts publicly closed).\n- Community sentiment is cautious but not expecting a closure, slightly favoring the lower end.\n\nI therefore set the final Rockford snow-day probability at **10%**, squarely in the low-probability Michigan-normal range but not zero to account for the small chance of unmodeled local issues or a conservative superintendent decision.\n\nBottom line: All signals—forecast, road safety, history, and community/neighbor behavior—converge on school being in session on Thursday, January 15, 2026.",
