    "Wind chill conflict with a credible source (Weather.com) indicating ≤ -20°F during early bus hours (5–7 AM), which triggers the non-negotiable extreme-cold closure rule",
    "Even without snow, subfreezing temps + mist raise black-ice risk on bridges/ramps/untreated rural segments during 5–9 AM",
    "No accumulating snow expected and plow/road resources appear normal—so the only reason this is high is the extreme wind chill trigger",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closure ‘domino effect’ and no strong community buzz—slightly lowers confidence (but not probability under the rule)",
    "Power grid conditions are quiet with only isolated outages; not a closure driver for Thursday"

  "decision_rationale": "Meteorology/history/safety/infrastructure/news largely agree the ‘base case’ is an open day: near-zero snowfall, light winds, and routine winter operations—normally a ~5–12% closure setup in Michigan (maybe higher chance of a delay due to mist/spot ice). However, the Web Weather Verification includes a critical alert that Weather.com shows wind chill around -25°F to -26°F during 5–6 AM, which is ≤ -20°F during bus hours. Per the extreme-cold rules, that single credible source is sufficient and requires an automatic 90–95% closure probability, regardless of other factors. Confidence is only MODERATE because that web data is flagged as stale/internally inconsistent versus the API, but the decision framework mandates acting on the colder credible scenario to avoid severe safety consequences at bus stops. Recommendation: plan for closure (or at minimum a no-bus/remote day), with an early-morning final check of actual wind chill observations and district route-driver reports.",
