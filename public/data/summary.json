  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts converge on “cold but dry” with 0\" snow, non-extreme wind chills for Monday morning, and a low closure likelihood. Infrastructure and safety agree roads should be serviceable; risk is mainly localized slick spots.\n2) Disagreement: Web verifier flagged one -23°F feels-like value, but that came from a date-mismatched Weather.com locale page; the credible cross-check (WeatherAPI vs Weather.com canonical) supports feels-like near ~0–2°F during 6–9 AM. Safety’s “moderate” ice risk is clarified as isolated patches (5–15% of route mileage intermittent slickness), not widespread glaze.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow end time is effectively “no event.” Hours from ‘snow end’ to 7:40 AM is not limiting; major roads expected clear/salty by 6:30 AM. Neighborhood streets may remain packed/variable but generally passable.\n4) Ice? No new freezing rain/sleet indicated. Ice concern is pre-existing/spot refreeze, not systemic.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Mon 1/26 closures/delays located across key neighbors in this scan; that removes the +15–20% bump.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages are single digits; no sign of local outage-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: No credible source supports ≤ -20°F for Mon 1/26 AM; therefore no cold-trigger override.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) a late-developing lake-effect streamer depositing quick snow bursts pre-dawn, (b) widespread freezing fog/black ice forming more broadly than expected, or (c) an unexpected sharp drop in wind chill toward policy thresholds.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verification (5%) all point to a very low closure risk. With no active storm/ice and no neighbor-closure trend, I hold close to the debate consensus: 6%.",
