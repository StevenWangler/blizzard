    "No accumulating snow or active precipitation signal in the provided forecast window; Michigan districts typically stay open in cold/dry high-pressure setups",
    "Main credible hazard is patchy black ice during the pre-dawn/bus window (bridges/overpasses, shaded rural roads, untreated neighborhood streets), not a widespread ‘impassable roads’ situation",
    "Potential for localized fog/ice fog reducing visibility around 6–8 AM (signal present but uncertain/possibly patchy); could nudge toward a delay if verified on multiple routes",
    "No confirmed Rockford PS or neighboring-district closure/delay announcements for Mon 2/2 in the latest news scan; community signal does not indicate a domino-effect closure",
    "Power grid/outages are minimal (Kent County ~1 customer out), so no operational closure pressure from utilities"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, and news intel there’s broad agreement: this is most likely a normal winter operating day for Rockford with no new snow and light winds. The only meaningful closure pathway would be widespread, verified glazing/black ice making multiple routes unsafe, or a Monday-specific forecast change introducing freezing drizzle/snow during the commute. The wind-chill/‘feels like’ discrepancy is noted, but the binding extreme-cold rule is not triggered here because the initial web verifier did not confirm ≤-20°F wind chill for the Monday 6–8 AM window. Given Michigan’s high threshold for full closures, the best Brier-optimized stance is low (single digits) for a full snow day, while recognizing a higher-than-8% chance of a 2-hour delay if early route checks find widespread slickness or route-wide dense fog.",
