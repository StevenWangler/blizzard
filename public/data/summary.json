    "No accumulating snow or ice forecast for Wed 2/25 during the 5–9 AM decision window (dry, cold post-frontal pattern)",

    "Primary roads/trunklines likely clear/treated by bus time; main plausible hazard is localized refreeze/black ice on bridges, shaded rural connectors, and subdivision streets",

  "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, history, safety, infrastructure, news intel, and grid: the common signal is a cold/breezy but essentially dry Wednesday with 0\" additional snow/ice expected. That strongly favors Rockford being OPEN (as Michigan districts typically operate normally in these conditions). The only meaningful closure pathway is not new precipitation but antecedent refreeze: Tue evening featured above-freezing temps followed by a rapid drop below 32°F with patchy snow showers, which can leave thin glaze/black ice—especially on untreated residential streets, shaded curves, stop approaches, bridges/overpasses, and potentially school lots/sidewalks. However, nothing indicates widespread impassability: trunklines and county connectors are expected to be winter-normal by 6:30 AM, neighboring-district closures are not confirmed, and there’s no credible extreme-cold trigger. Web weather verification shows cross-source temperature/feels-like mismatch, but the warmer snippets are explicitly stale; importantly, no source shows ≤ -20°F wind chill. Net: a full snow day is unlikely; a short delay is the more plausible ‘upside’ risk if morning spot checks find widespread glare ice on routes or lots.",
