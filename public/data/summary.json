  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Expert agreement:\n- **All four experts agree** this is a **post‑storm morning**, not an active blizzard during the commute.\n  - Meteorologist: Heavy snow and blowing snow **end by ~1–3 AM**, Warning expires **7 AM**, **0.0\" new snow** during commute.\n  - Safety analyst: Worst conditions **6 PM–3 AM**; by **6–7:40 AM** primary and most secondary roads are **plowed and passable**, with typical winter slickness.\n  - Historian: Similar patterns (storm day + cold, improving next day) yield **low snow‑day rates (10–25%)** in Rockford/Kent Co.\n  - News intel: As of Monday evening, **no district (Rockford or neighbors)** has announced a Tuesday closure/delay; regional coverage frames Tue as hazardous but not universally closed.\n- All agree on **very cold temps/wind chills** and **high refreeze/ice risk**, but **no freezing rain or accumulating snow** during bus times.\n\n2) Points of disagreement or nuance:\n- Meteorological text initially mentioned a trace of mixed precip, but the follow‑up clarifies: **only a tiny freezing rain blip around midnight (~0.03 mm)**, then **completely dry 3–9 AM**.\n- Visibility: earlier analysis suggested 1–2 mile vis possible; follow‑up refines: **~1 mile vis 5–7 AM in rural areas**, then **rapid improvement to ~6+ miles by 8 AM**.\n- Safety vs. caution: Safety analyst calls risk **moderate** but still leans toward **“cold but operable”**, possibly **delays** if rural roads lag. No expert argues for high probability of full closure.\n- Community expectation: News intel labels sentiment **\"uncertain/mixed\"**, not strongly in the “everything will be closed” camp.\n\nThese are refinements, not true conflicts; they all point to **manageable but not great** conditions.\n\n3) Plow timing math (storm end → school start):\n- Worst conditions end: **~3:00 AM Tue**.\n- First buses/decisions: ~**5:00–5:30 AM** check, buses rolling ~**6:00–6:30 AM** for Rockford.\n- High school start: ~**7:40 AM**.\n- From safety analyst:\n  - **5:00 AM**: Primary roads already had **at least one plow/salt pass**; secondary roads mostly opened but still rutted; very slick in spots.\n  - **6:00 AM**: Multiple passes on primaries; **“winter normal”** with caution; secondaries improved but still compacted snow and ice patches.\n  - **7:40 AM**: Primaries in **good winter shape**; most secondaries **passable with careful bus driving**; main remaining issues: localized drifting and icy campus/sidewalk spots.\n- Effective cleanup window **from ~3:00 AM to 7:40 AM = ~4.5 hours** of post‑storm work **plus** earlier overnight plowing while it was snowing. That’s ample by Kent County standards for a sub‑8\" event.\n\n4) Ice presence (critical factor):\n- Meteorologist follow‑up:\n  - Tiny **freezing rain** around **midnight only**, then **0.0 mm precip** and **0.0\" snow** from 3–9 AM.\n  - 4–8 AM: **Overcast, dry, no freezing drizzle**, will_it_rain = 0, will_it_snow = 0.\n- Safety analyst: **High ice risk** from **refreeze** on very cold pavement, especially bridges, intersections, parking lots, and untreated secondaries.\n- So: **Yes, ice is present**, but as **black ice/refreeze**, **not** as an ongoing ice storm or fresh glaze falling during the commute.\n- In Michigan terms, that’s serious but **routine winter hazard**, not closure‑by‑itself unless combined with poor plow progress or active precip.\n\n5) Neighboring districts:\n- News intel (fresh scan of TV lists + district sites):\n  - **No neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview, Comstock Park)** have posted **Tuesday Jan 20 closures/delays** yet.\n  - Forest Hills is closed **Monday** for weather, but **no decision posted for Tuesday**.\n  - Rockford’s only listed closure is **Monday (MLK/PD)**, not weather‑related.\n- Per your weighting rule: **3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20%** bump. Here we have **0 neighbors confirmed for Tuesday** → **no upward adjustment**. If anything, the lack of early closures nudges the probability slightly **down**, but I treat that mainly as **no positive bump** rather than a strong negative.\n\n6) What would make this prediction wrong?\n- **Upside miss (should have predicted higher chance of closure)** if:\n  - Plow crews fall behind badly, especially on rural secondaries, due to drifting or staffing/equipment issues, such that **4–5 AM checks** find many roads barely passable.\n  - The small midnight freezing rain signal is **underestimated** and creates more widespread glaze, especially on hills/intersections, making buses unsafe despite no new precip.\n  - An unmodeled **lake‑effect band re‑flares** directly over Kent County during the 4–7 AM window, cutting vis below 1/4 mile with new accumulation.\n  - Power outages or building/boiler failures in extreme cold (not indicated by current intel) force closures for reasons unrelated to roads.\n- **Downside miss (probability should be even lower)** if:\n  - Overnight clearing goes **better than expected**, with roads largely wet‑dry instead of packed snow, and wind chills stay on the less extreme end of guidance.\n  - Neighbor districts and Rockford post **“we’re open”** messaging or only consider a few isolated delays.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your directive):\n- **Meteorology – 35% weight**: \n  - Core input: **no new accumulating snow**, **post‑storm pattern**, **winds easing**, and **Warning ending at 7 AM**. This strongly pulls the base probability **down**. On Michigan thresholds alone: 0\" new snow on the day + cold = roughly **10–20%**.\n- **Safety – 25% weight**:\n  - Risk labeled **moderate**, but with clear language that conditions are **“cold but operable”** and that **a full snow day would typically require worse conditions** than forecast.\n  - Suggests possible **1–2 hour delay**, not system‑wide closure. This supports a probability in the **low 20s or below**.\n- **History – 20% weight**:\n  - Similar patterns give **0.10–0.25 snow‑day rate**; seasonal context nudges **slightly lower (-0.05)**.\n  - Rockford historically **stays open** in mornings like this unless totals are extreme or cold is more severe.\n  - This anchors the range around **15–20%**.\n- **News Intelligence – 20% weight (secret weapon)**:\n  - No Tuesday closures yet among neighbours → **no +15–20% domino bump**.\n  - Community sentiment described as **mixed/uncertain**, not “everyone expects a snow day.”\n  - Regional media emphasize hazards but not universal closures.\n  - This keeps the probability **near the lower end** of the historical/meteorological ranges, not higher.\n\nNUMERICAL SYNTHESIS & THRESHOLDS\n- Base from meteorology/thresholds: **~12–18%** (0\" new snow, significant but not catastrophic prior storm, high Michigan tolerance).\n- Safety: supports **operable with possible delays**, consistent with **15–25%** for a *full* snow day.\n- History: analogs **15%, 10%, 25%** → rough mean ≈ **17%**, seasonal adj pulls that down a bit.\n- News intel: **no closures, no strong “it’s a lock” sentiment** → stay at **low end** of that cluster.\n- Applying your Michigan thresholds:\n  - We are effectively in the **<4\" new snow on decision day** bucket, which you peg at **5–15%**. The prior storm raises concern slightly, so I move **slightly above 15%** but stay close.\n\nFinal call: **18% probability of a full snow day** for Rockford on Tue Jan 20, 2026.\n- This is **decisively low**, outside the 40–60% band you want to avoid.\n- It reflects that a closure is **not impossible** (especially if roads under‑perform expectations) but **clearly not the favored outcome**.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
