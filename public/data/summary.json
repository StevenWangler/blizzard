    "No accumulating snow forecast Friday (0\") — removes the primary Michigan closure trigger",
    "Dangerous cold: NWS Cold Weather Advisory; 6–9 AM wind chills forecast roughly -12°F to -15°F (cold, but not in the ≤ -20°F near-guarantee tier)",
    "Patchy refreeze/black-ice risk from prior-day wintry precip, mainly on secondary roads/bridges/parking lots; salt effectiveness reduced in single digits",
    "Visibility/fog risk appears minimal during 6–9 AM (forecast ~6 mi); worst dense/freezing fog signals are overnight/late evening",
    "No confirmed weather-related closures for Rockford or nearby districts at time of check (neighboring closure found was non-weather related)"

  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1) AGREEMENT: All experts agree Friday is a cold-driven day with essentially no new snow; main risks are wind chill exposure and patchy refreeze/black ice. Also agreement that a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) DISAGREEMENT: News sources suggested snow might linger into Friday regionally, but the meteorological dataset/hours show 0% precip and good 6–9 AM visibility; I weight the explicit hourly forecast higher. Visibility “0 mi” readings look confined to overnight/late evening rather than commute time.\n3) Plow timing math: If Thu operations wrap ~19:00, there are ~12h40m until a 07:40 start (and ~11h until ~06:00 first pickups). Even if final spot-treat starts ~23:00, there are ~8h40m to 07:40 (~7h to 06:00). Best window is ~03:30–05:30 for fresh treatment. This supports manageability absent new snow.\n4) ANY ice? Yes, but likely patchy not widespread: moderate refreeze risk (bridges, shaded secondaries, lots). Salt is less effective in single digits, so abrasives/targeting matter; this raises delay odds more than full-closure odds.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed weather-related closures/delays for Rockford or listed neighbors at time checked; one neighboring closure (Northview) was for a non-weather reason, so no +15–20% “wave” adjustment.\n6) What would make me WRONG? (a) Wind chills verify closer to -20°F to -25°F at 6–8 AM (policy-trigger territory), (b) refreeze proves widespread on bus routes (not patchy), or (c) an unmodeled lake-effect band/visibility crash develops pre-dawn.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per system weights):\n- Meteorology (30%): cold advisory but 6–9 AM wind chill ~-12 to -15 and no snow; lowers closure probability.\n- Safety (20% incl. infra/power): moderate patchy ice + extreme cold exposure; supports some chance of delay/closure.\n- History (15%): cold-only closures are uncommon unless thresholds met; antecedent refreeze can drive “sneaky delay.”\n- News intel (15%): no confirmed closure wave; reduces odds.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds and lack of snow/ice storm signals, I set full snow-day/closure probability at 23% (leaning ‘open, possible delay’ rather than ‘closed’).",
