    "Forecast Thu AM accumulation is modest (~1–2\" by ~6 AM; ~1.2\" most likely) which is below typical Michigan closure thresholds",
    "Snow ends early (around 03:00–04:00), giving meaningful cleanup time before buses/first traffic",
    "No meaningful ice signal for Thu AM (precip type snow; temps well below freezing)",
    "Main risk is localized slick/packed-snow glazing on secondary roads, intersections, bridges, and bus turnarounds; plus minor blowing/drifting on exposed roads",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays for Thu 01/22 from official sources/closing lists in the re-check window (no domino signal)"

  "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis with weighted inputs (Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News Intel 20%).\n\n1) Agreement across experts: All four analyses converge that the key accumulating snow window is overnight (~00:00–03:00) and that totals for Rockford are modest (around ~1\"), with cold temps maintaining slick spots rather than melting. They also agree impacts are more supportive of a delay than a closure if problems occur.\n\n2) Disagreements/conflicts and resolution: The only apparent conflict was the NWS advisory text mentioning 2–5\" and model codes showing 0-mile visibility/'blizzard' in the evening. Meteorologist clarification indicates the 2–5\" was for the *Wed morning* advisory period, and the evening blizzard/0-vis codes are likely an artifact not supported by precip amounts. So the higher-impact scenario is treated as low probability.\n\n3) Plow timing math: Snow end ~03:00–04:00 vs ~07:40 start gives ~3.5–5.0 clock-hours. Safety analyst notes effective clearing on secondary/bus routes is ~2.5–4.0 hours after accounting for primaries-first and neighborhood complexity—still generally adequate for a normal opening in Michigan for a ~1–2\" event.\n\n4) Ice check: Thu AM ice risk is LOW (snow-only overnight). There is MODERATE risk of packed-snow polishing/glazing at stops/intersections and on untreated/shaded secondary roads, but not the kind of widespread glaze that typically forces closures.\n\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel re-check found NO confirmed Thu 01/22 closures/delays among Rockford/Forest Hills/Sparta/Lowell/GRPS/Northview/Comstock Park/Cedar Springs in the crawl window and no strong “domino” signal on TV closings lists.\n\n6) What would make this wrong: (a) a lake-effect band unexpectedly locks in over Rockford pre-dawn, pushing totals into the 4\"+ range, (b) secondary/bus-route roads remain unplowed/untreated by ~6–7 AM, or (c) visibility drops sharply during the commute due to blowing snow despite low additional accumulation.\n\nPutting it together: Meteorology points strongly to a routine/light event with favorable timing; Safety flags moderate but manageable bus-route slickness; History suggests low closure rates for this pattern; News intel shows hazardous regional travel recently but no current closure cascade. Net: low probability of a full snow day; a 2-hour delay is the main alternative outcome.",
