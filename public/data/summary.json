    "Rockford Public Schools has an official, pre‑scheduled no‑school day on Monday, January 19, 2026 for MLK Jr. Day and staff professional development—students are not expected in school regardless of weather.",
    "Therefore there is no *weather-dependent* snow day decision to be made for Rockford on this date; closure is already certain for non‑weather reasons.",
    "Meteorology shows a strong but typical mid‑January West Michigan lake‑effect event: 3–8\" storm total over ~36 hours, around 0.6\" new snow on Monday itself, sub‑freezing temperatures, and blowing/drifting—but no ice and no true blizzard conditions.",
    "Historical patterns for similar lake‑effect/Winter Storm Warning setups give roughly a 50–65% *would‑close* rate for Rockford when school is actually scheduled, but that is moot here because the calendar has school closed regardless of conditions.",
    "Safety assessment rates risk as high for travel (snow‑covered roads, drifting, poor visibility, cold wind chills) and would strongly support considering closure *if* this were a normal school day.",
    "News and community intelligence confirm that neighboring districts like Cedar Springs and Forest Hills appear to be in session and have not yet announced weather‑driven closures, so there is no current domino effect or 3+ neighbor closure signal to bump probabilities upward."

  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Agreement:\n  • All four domains agree on a significant, but not unprecedented, lake‑effect winter storm affecting Sunday night through Monday: cold (single digits to teens), steady snow, blowing and drifting, and hazardous travel.\n  • Everyone agrees precipitation is snow only—no mixed precip or glaze—and temperatures remain well below freezing.\n  • All concur that Monday morning travel will be difficult: snow‑covered roads, reduced visibility, drifting on rural north–south routes, and chilly wind chills near or just below 0°F.\n- Key divergence:\n  • Meteorology and history frame this as a high‑impact but manageable Michigan storm where schools often stay open or are mixed (some open, some close), implying perhaps ~40–60% *weather‑based* closure odds if this were a normal school day.\n  • Safety explicitly recommends districts should strongly consider full closure for travel risk.\n  • News intelligence decisively clarifies that Rockford Public Schools is **already closed for MLK Jr. Day and staff PD**, so there is no pending snow-day decision for Rockford itself. Neighboring districts are not yet signaling widespread weather closures.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions: roughly 2026‑01‑18 16:00 to 2026‑01‑19 20:00.\n- Snow continues through the overnight into the bus window (about 6:00–8:00 AM). Plows will work all night, but fresh snow and drifting during that same window mean roads remain snow‑covered and slick—even if primary routes are passable.\n- From an operational standpoint, there is **no clean gap** where the snow stops several hours before the commute; snow is ongoing into the morning. Normally, this would tilt *against* holding school and *toward* a higher snow‑day probability if classes were scheduled.\n\n3. Ice assessment (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorology: temperatures well below freezing the entire period, all snow, and no warm nose aloft—no sleet or freezing rain indicated.\n- Safety lists “ice_formation_risk: high,” but context shows this is mainly from compaction, hard pack, and refreeze on very cold pavement, not a classic glaze event.\n- Net: this is a **snow-and-cold event without true ice accretion.** That keeps impacts in the high but not catastrophic range per Michigan norms.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior\n- Rockford: explicitly closed for MLK Jr. Day/PD, not for weather.\n- Cedar Springs: calendar shows **school in session** Jan 19; no weather closure announced.\n- Forest Hills: no explicit MLK no‑school marking and no weather‑related closure posts for Jan 19 as of the latest intel.\n- Other Kent ISD neighbors (Sparta, Lowell, Greenville): no clear public announcements of Jan 19 weather or holiday closures.\n- Therefore, there is **no 3+ neighboring districts weather-closed signal** that would normally bump the snow‑day probability by +15–20%.\n\n5. How I weight each expert (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Strong storm, Winter Storm Warning, 3–8\" total, but only ~0.6\" additional on Monday, no ice, and conditions within Michigan’s normal high‑tolerance range.\n  • If school were scheduled, meteorology alone would probably justify something like 35–45% closure odds.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Rates risk as high and recommends treating Monday as a high‑risk travel day with strong consideration of full closure.\n  • If school were in session, safety would push closure odds closer to the 55–65% range.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Historical analogs show 35–65% closure/disruption rates in similar setups: some years close, some stay open, depending on band placement and local policy.\n  • This supports a middling–high weather‑based probability if Jan 19 were a normal school day but not a near‑lock.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, but decisive):\n  • Confirms Rockford is **already closed for non‑weather reasons**; thus the relevant quantity is the probability of an **additional, purely weather-based snow day decision**, which for this date is effectively near zero.\n  • Also confirms neighbors are not (yet) cascading into weather closures, so there is no strong community‑pressure signal to reinterpret the meteorology/safety in a more aggressive way.\n\n6. Translating this into a snow-day probability\n- Hypothetical baseline (if Jan 19 were a normal school day):\n  • Meteorology + safety + history together suggest roughly 50–60% weather closure odds for Rockford: Winter Storm Warning, hazardous commutes, continuous snow during the morning bus window, and notable drifting. This fits the \"6–8\" with good timing\" / \"high-impact lake-effect\" band in your rubric.\n- However, the **actual question** for Rockford on Jan 19, 2026 is:\n  • \"What is the probability that Rockford will have a *snow day decision* beyond the already‑scheduled MLK/PD closure?\"\n  • Given the official calendar and communications, there is no need or precedent to add a separate snow day on top of a holiday/PD closure. Families have already been told there is no school; the district does not gain anything by also branding it a weather day.\n- Therefore, the true probability of an additional, formal **weather-related snow day call** for Rockford on Jan 19 is extremely low.\n\n7. Why not 0%?\n- To avoid an overconfident zero in Brier scoring and recognizing that, in theory, a district could retroactively characterize the day as weather-impacted (e.g., shift PD to remote if conditions became extreme), I allow a very small residual probability (5%).\n- Operationally, though, families should treat this as *not a snow day contest at all*—it is simply a pre‑planned no‑school day that happens to line up with a winter storm.\n\n8. What would make me wrong?\n- If:\n  • Rockford decided to **change the nature of the day**—for example, cancel in‑person staff PD and explicitly label Jan 19 as a weather closure across official channels; or\n  • The storm rapidly intensified into a regionally recognized blizzard/ice storm with widespread power outages, causing many districts (including Rockford) to publicly reframe the day as a snow day;\n  • Or neighboring districts (Cedar Springs, Forest Hills, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) all announced last‑minute closures specifically citing weather, creating a strong domino effect and a re‑evaluation of what Jan 19 \"counts\" as for Rockford.\n- Barring such unusual communication changes, the pre‑scheduled closure dominates and my 5% weather‑snow‑day probability should score well on a Brier basis.\n\nGiven all this, I set the **snow-day probability for Rockford on Monday, Jan 19, 2026, as a weather‑driven decision at 5%**, with **very high confidence**, because the district is already officially closed for non‑weather reasons.",
