  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- AGREEMENT:\n  • All four lenses (meteorology, history, safety, news) characterize this as an advisory-level, routine Michigan winter event.\n  • Total snow near ~3\" overnight, ending or tapering around the morning commute.\n  • Winds are modest; no blizzard-level drifting or whiteouts.\n  • Temperatures stay in the upper 20s to around 30°F—cold enough for slick spots but not an extreme cold closure scenario.\n  • Roads will be slick, especially side streets and lots, but primary routes should be plowed and passable with caution.\n  • Each domain implies: school likely open, with a possible minor delay at most.\n\n- DISAGREEMENTS:\n  • There are no strong conflicts—differences are only in emphasis:\n    - Meteorology: explicitly estimates a 20–30% snow day probability.\n    - Historian: similar events yield closure rates 10–20%, leaning lower than the met range.\n    - Safety: labels risk as moderate, notes significant morning-commute impact, but still says a full-system closure is not strongly indicated and suggests possibly a 1–2 hour delay.\n    - News/community: indicates no pre-emptive closure signals and no neighboring districts planning to close.\n  These are consistent with a low—but non-zero—closure probability.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions: 00:00–07:30 with steady accumulating snow.\n- Buses typically roll ~6:30–7:00; school start around 7:40–8:00.\n- Snow rate peaks overnight (~0.7\"/hr) and tapers near commute time.\n- Effective plow window:\n  • Crews are working throughout the night as snow falls.\n  • By ~6–7 AM, major routes likely have had multiple passes but still may be snow-covered or slushy.\n  • Because snow ends near 7–8 AM, there is only about 0–1 hour of post-snow cleanup before the first students/buses are on the roads, so side roads and lots will not be pristine but should be manageable.\n- This supports safety’s view: messy but serviceable, more aligned with normal operations or at most a short delay than a full closure.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Advisory mentions a light glaze and mixed precipitation earlier, and the safety analyst tags ice formation risk as high.\n- However, the meteorology notes:\n  • Monday’s main overnight window is predominantly snow with temps solidly below freezing.\n  • Any ice is patchy—a light glaze, not a significant ice storm.\n- In Michigan thresholds, 3\" snow plus light glaze is well below the 8\"+ or true ice-storm level that drives 60–85%+ closure probabilities.\n- Ice is a watch item for sidewalks/parking lots but not enough, by itself, to override all other signals.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel is clear:\n  • No neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have posted Jan. 5 closures or even strong warnings.\n  • Rockford’s own messaging assumes a normal return from break on Jan. 5, with no caveats.\n  • Regional media show no school-closing lists or special travel warnings for that Monday.\n  • Social/media buzz: effectively “no_buzz” about a snow day.\n- Per your weighting rules, the absence of neighboring closures and the community’s “this is routine” posture argues for staying on the low end of probabilities—no upward adjustment.\n\n5. Weighting the four expert domains\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Calls this a borderline but likely open scenario with 20–30% snow day odds.\n  • Timing is marginal (snow ending near commute), but totals and winds are modest.\n  • Weighted contribution: center of that band (~25%) × 0.35 ≈ 8.8 points.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Labels risk moderate; commute impact significant but manageable.\n  • Explicit statement: forecast alone does not strongly indicate a full-system closure; suggests considering a 1–2 hour delay depending on real-time conditions.\n  • Interprets to an implicit closure probability in roughly the 15–25% range.\n  • Take ~20% × 0.25 = 5 points.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Analog patterns show closure rates: 15%, 20%, and 10%, with a seasonal adjustment leaning lower.\n  • Effective historical closure probability ≈ 12–18%; use ~15%.\n  • 15% × 0.20 = 3 points.\n\n- News & Intelligence (20% weight):\n  • Secret weapon: zero neighboring closures, zero buzz, strong signal of normal operations.\n  • That context pushes expectation slightly below the raw met/safety numbers—say ~10–15% closure probability from a behavioral standpoint.\n  • Use 12% × 0.20 ≈ 2.4 points.\n\n- Combined baseline: 8.8 + 5 + 3 + 2.4 ≈ 19.2%.\n  • Given the explicit meteorological 20–30% range and safety’s advisory-level concern, I round slightly upward to 22% to reflect the marginal timing risk without overstating it.\n\n6. Michigan-specific thresholds and why 22% fits\n- Your thresholds:\n  • <4\" snow → 5–15% typical.\n  • Here: ~3\" plus some glaze and marginal timing near buses.\n- The timing and light ice justify nudging above the 5–15% base into the low 20s, but conditions still sit well below the 6–8\" or ice-storm tiers that would justify 35–60%+.\n- With no neighboring closings (so no +15–20% boost), staying near the low end of the meteorologist’s 20–30% band is appropriate.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- Upside error (actual closure when I predicted 22%):\n  • Heavier-than-forecast snow band sets up over Rockford, pushing totals into 5–6\" with poor plow catch-up.\n  • More extensive ice than modeled—e.g., a few hours of freezing drizzle just before dawn causing widespread glazing on roads, lots, and walkways.\n  • Multiple serious crashes or police/MDOT advisories pushing district leadership to cancel regardless of strict totals.\n\n- Downside error (school open when a higher probability might have been justified):\n  • If secondary and rural roads are treated less effectively than assumed—e.g., staffing issues, equipment failures—leading to poor passability on key bus routes.\n  • If patchy ice on lots/sidewalks is worse than expected, forcing very late decisions.\n\n8. Final stance\n- Given all data, a full snow day remains unlikely but plausible at the margins.\n- The most probable operational outcomes:\n  • Normal start with messy commute and strong caution messaging.\n  • Secondary: 1–2 hour delay to allow extra plow/salt time if early-morning spotter reports are poor.\n  • Least likely: full closure.\n- To beat the stats students (Brier focus) and avoid being wishy-washy, I choose a decisive value on the low side of the credible range: 22% chance of a full snow day, with correspondingly high confidence that school will be open in some form Monday morning.",
