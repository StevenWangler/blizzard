    "Snow amount looks minor for West Michigan (~0.9\") and is timed mainly Sunday evening (gives overnight maintenance time before Monday commute)",
    "No confirmed ice/freezing rain signal; main hazard is refreeze/black ice on untreated/secondary roads due to very cold pavement temps",
    "Winds appear light/modest → low blowing/drifting and visibility risk",
    "Neighboring districts: no confirmed Mon 1/26 closures/delays found (reduces domino-effect risk)",
    "Wind chill ‘auto-trigger’ (≤ -20°F) is NOT confirmed for Monday morning by authoritative NWS source; WeatherAPI sub -20°F value appears tied to Fri conditions and conflicts with other sources",
    "Power outages are minimal (~0.02% of Kent County) → no operational override"

  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreements across experts: All teams converge that this is primarily a light-snow + extreme-cold/refreeze setup (not a heavy snow/blizzard). Winds are modest; visibility impacts are limited; power outages are not a driver. Most believe “delay > closure” if anything.\n2) Disagreements: The main conflict was the Web Weather Verifier’s ‘≤ -20°F feels-like’ trigger from WeatherAPI (Fri conditions) versus NWS/other sources not showing that extreme for Monday; and whether conditions “worsen” after midnight. Follow-up verification indicates no authoritative support for ≤ -20°F wind chills on Monday morning and no credible 4+ inch snow scenario for Rockford in the Sun night→Mon window.\n3) Plow timing math: If snow ends ~22:00 Sun, there are ~8.5 hours until 06:30 Mon; if it ends ~00:00, ~6.5 hours. Infrastructure monitor says that’s typically enough for trunklines and most county primaries to be bus-passable, but residential/local streets likely remain snow-packed early—supporting delay risk, not an automatic closure.\n4) Ice?: No explicit freezing rain/ice accretion signal. Ice risk is “moderate” via refreeze/black ice, not a glaze storm.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel re-scan did not find Mon 1/26 closures/delays posted by Rockford or nearby major districts (Forest Hills, Sparta, Cedar Springs, Northview, GRPS, Lowell). That removes the +15–20% closure bump.\n6) Power outages: Low footprint (~0.02% county), stable—no override.\n7) Wind chill confirmation: NWS observed wind chill Fri was ~-13°F and Monday forecast does not indicate dangerously low wind chills; no multi-source confirmation of ≤ -20°F for Monday AM.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) a narrow lake-effect band sets up after midnight into the 4–8 AM commute producing several inches locally, (b) widespread polished black ice on bus routes worse than expected, or (c) an unexpected Monday-morning cold/wind spike driving wind chills toward ≤ -20°F.\n\nWEIGHTING (per directive):\n- Meteorology (25%): Points strongly toward “manageable snowfall/timing” → lowers closure odds.\n- Safety (20%): Moderate black-ice/secondary-road risk → nudges up slightly (delay more likely than closure).\n- History (15%): Similar setups rarely close in Rockford area → lowers.\n- News Intel (15%): No Mon closures confirmed; no buzz → lowers.\n- Infrastructure (10%): Overnight window likely sufficient; residential streets lag → modest bump but not to closure.\n- Power Grid (10%): Minimal outages → neutral.\n- Web Verifier (5%): Confirms discrepancy; no authoritative Monday ≤ -20°F → removes ‘auto-trigger’ bump.\n\nFinal: 18% probability of a full Rockford snow day (closure). A 2-hour delay is the more plausible adverse outcome if black ice is widespread on secondary/local roads at 5–7 AM.",
