    "Primary hazard is ice/black ice (trace freezing rain/drizzle + refreeze) during the 05:00–08:00 bus window, not snowfall",
    "Temps near/under 0°F reduce salt effectiveness; secondary/neighborhood roads and parking lots likely remain inconsistent at first bell",
    "Tuesday had widespread crashes/freeway shutdowns, increasing risk of lingering slick spots and slower-than-normal recovery on some routes",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district Wed closures/delays at time checked; FOX17 mostly shows activity cancellations, which limits the ‘follow-the-region’ bump",
    "Wind chill is cold but not at the near-automatic closure threshold (no verified <= -20°F)",

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts converge that Wed is NOT a heavy-snow day; the risk is a narrow morning window of black ice/spot glazing with very cold temps. They also agree wind chill is uncomfortable but not extreme enough alone to force closure.\n2) Disagreement: Safety rates the commute risk ‘high,’ while meteorology/history emphasize that QPF is tiny and patchy—more typical of DELAYS than full closures. This is a hazard-vs-closure translation disagreement, not a data disagreement.\n3) Plow timing math: Forecast freezing precip is flagged intermittently 00:00–06:00 with a tail risk to ~06:30. That leaves ~0–2 hours before typical 06:30–07:40 bus/school windows—tight, especially for neighborhood streets. Highways/arterials likely serviceable by ~05:30–07:30; residential roads may remain snowpacked/icy until ~08:00–11:00.\n4) Ice: YES—trace freezing rain/drizzle plus refreeze is the main driver.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Wed school-day closures/delays located (Rockford not posted; Forest Hills shows activities canceled, not closure). So no +15–20% regional-closure bump.\n6) Power outages: Very low, stable; not a driver.\n7) Wind chill verification: Multiple sources do NOT show <= -20°F; coldest verified feels-like is around a few degrees below zero to single digits below (not closure-threshold).\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) freezing drizzle is more widespread than “patchy” (a true glaze event), (b) a surprise pre-dawn fog/drizzle band drops visibility and adds road film, or (c) road treatment is delayed/ineffective on secondary routes, leading to morning crash spikes.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) says patchy trace icing; Safety (25%) says high morning risk; History (15%) supports delays more than closures in this pattern; News (15%) shows severe Tue impacts but no confirmed Wed closures; Infrastructure (10%) indicates neighborhood roads likely lag; Power (5%) stable; Web verification (5%) confirms no -20°F threshold. Net: closure is a minority-but-real outcome driven by bus-route variability and ice at daybreak. I land slightly above the debate average (31%) at 33% because the overlap of possible icing through ~06:30 and very cold pavement increases the chance of a district choosing caution, but lack of confirmed regional Wed closures and minimal additional QPF keeps it well below 50%.",
