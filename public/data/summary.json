  "decision_rationale": "All expert inputs align on the same base case: Thu 2/12 is a cold, quiet day with **0\" new snow** and light winds, which in Michigan almost always means **school is open**. The only meaningful disruption pathway is *non-snow*: (1) lingering moisture from Wed’s light freezing rain signal refreezing into patchy black ice on secondary/rural roads and bridge decks, plus (2) possible dense/freezing fog during 6–8 AM. \n\nConflicts were mostly about whether the forecast’s repeated “0-mile visibility” values are literal or an artifact. Follow-up meteorology supports treating “0 mi” as likely overdone/rounded and, if fog occurs, more **patchy** (river/low spots) than a countywide shutdown scenario. \n\nNews intelligence did not find confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays on the main closings feed, and RPS did not post a Thu 2/12 weather decision in accessible site sections—both signals lean strongly away from a full closure. Infrastructure and power-grid inputs show no plow catch-up need and no major outage driver. \n\nTherefore: **low probability of a full snow day (closure)**, with the more realistic operational outcome being **OPEN**, and a smaller but real chance of a **2-hour delay** if dense fog (<1/4 mile) and slick secondary roads are confirmed on the ground right before bus dispatch.",
