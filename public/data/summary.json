  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Calls this a cold but quiet post-storm day with 0\" new snow, light winds, and good visibility. Explicitly states schools should be open on time.\n- Historian: Shows that similar patterns (cold, dry day after light snow/ice) yield only ~3–8% snow day rates in West Michigan, and emphasizes that this is not a typical closure setup.\n- Safety Analyst: Rates road conditions and driving safety very highly (9–9.5/10) with only isolated refreeze/black ice concerns and explicitly recommends no snow day or delay.\n- News/Intel: Finds no Rockford or neighboring-district closure announcements and no strong community push for closure.\n\nAll four are aligned: conditions are cold but manageable; no active storm; no strong institutional or community signal for closing. There are no meaningful conflicts across the analyses.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Precipitation ended on Wednesday (12/03); Thursday (12/04) is dry all day.\n- That gives plows and salt trucks the entire overnight period (well over 8 hours) before a ~7:40 AM high school start to clear and treat roads.\n- Safety scores for primary and secondary roads are 9.5 and 9, indicating that this cleanup window is judged sufficient and that any residual issues are minor/isolated.\n- Effective plow/salt timing plus no new snow during the morning commute strongly supports normal operations.\n\n3. Ice concerns\n- There was light snow/freezing rain on Wednesday, so some refreeze risk exists as temps remain in the teens.\n- Safety assessment flags ice-formation risk as “moderate” but still gives:\n  - Driving conditions: 9/10\n  - Parking lots: 9/10\n  - Walking: 6.5/10 (the weakest, due to isolated slick sidewalks/paths).\n- Critically, no active freezing rain, drizzle, or new precip is forecast for Thursday; this is residual, spotty ice only.\n- In Michigan, widespread, ongoing icing is usually required to justify a closure. That is not present here.\n\n4. Neighboring district status and community signals\n- News intel finds:\n  - No Rockford Public Schools announcements of closure or delay for 12/04.\n  - No neighboring Kent County districts (e.g., Forest Hills) signaling closures or early domino-effect behavior.\n  - Some other parts of Michigan have closures, but not in this local region.\n- Social media sentiment is described as “uncertain,” not strongly expecting a snow day.\n- With 0 confirmed neighboring closures in similar conditions, there is no basis for the +15–20% probability bump that would apply if 3+ neighboring districts had closed.\n\n5. Historical baselines vs. Michigan thresholds\n- Historical analogs for this exact setup (cold, dry, day-after-light-event) show snow-day probabilities in the low single digits to under 10%.\n- Michigan closure thresholds from the brief:\n  - <4\" snow = 5–15% typical; here, there is 0\" new snow.\n  - No blizzard, no ice storm, and wind chills during the bus window are above the typical -15°F to -20°F cold-closure triggers.\n- Historically, Rockford remains open on days like this unless:\n  - There is an active storm with accumulating snow or ice during the commute, or\n  - Wind chills are dangerously low, or\n  - Major infrastructure/utility issues occur.\nNone of those apply.\n\n6. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Very clear, low-impact forecast: 0\" snow, 0% precip, light winds, good visibility. Strongly points toward school open.\n- Safety (25%): Road and travel metrics are excellent, with only modest walking/slick-spot concerns. Recommends no closure or delay.\n- History (20%): Analog days rarely produce snow days in this region; supports a very low baseline probability (~3–8%).\n- News/Intel (20%): No local closure buzz, no neighboring domino effect, no advanced warning of issues. This keeps the probability at the low end (no upward adjustment).\n\nCombining these, I set the probability slightly above the absolute historical minimum to account for minor residual ice risk and small model/forecast uncertainties, but still firmly in the “schools open” regime: 5%.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 5% estimate could fail are:\n- Unexpected overnight icing: Unforecasted freezing drizzle or more extensive refreeze creating black ice on a large share of secondary roads and school sites.\n- Major localized hazard: A significant early-morning accident cluster, unanticipated dense freezing fog, or a late-arriving advisory that causes transportation leaders to err on the side of caution.\n- Infrastructure issues: Sudden localized power outages or heating failures at multiple school buildings.\nThese scenarios are all currently low-probability, but they are the primary tail risks.\n\nConclusion: With no new precipitation, strong plow timing, good road scores, and no closure signals from neighboring districts or the community, the most likely outcome is that Rockford Public Schools operate on a normal schedule on Thursday, December 4, 2025.",
