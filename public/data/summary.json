    "Forecast additional accumulation only around 1–2\" with mixed light snow/freezing drizzle—well under the 4\" threshold that typically starts to matter for Michigan closures.",

    "Winter Weather Advisory (not Warning) over Kent County while heavier lake-effect and whiteout conditions are focused mainly to the west/south; Rockford is in the nuisance-snow zone, not the high-impact core.",
    "Historical analogs for similar advisory-level late-November lake-effect events around Rockford show roughly 10–25% closure rates, and that’s before adjusting for Michigan’s high tolerance and strong road operations.",
    "Timing favors improvement before the next school morning (Nov 28): worst conditions are earlier on the 27th, with road crews having many hours to salt and plow before bus runs.",
    "Safety assessment indicates primary and secondary roads in ‘manageable but slick’ condition with improvements by late 27th and normal winter travel expected on the 28th—more consistent with caution or, at most, a rare delay than a full closure."

  "decision_rationale": "Synthesizing the three expert views, this is a textbook advisory-level Michigan lake-effect setup, not a high-probability snow-day pattern. Meteorology: Total new snow in Kent County is only about 1–2\" with light mixed precip and breezy WNW winds. Visibility extremes are tied to earlier bands, with a trend toward 4–10 miles and no fresh accumulating snow heading into Friday morning. Thermally, we stay below freezing but not near dangerous wind-chill thresholds. Historical patterns: Past events that look like this—late-November, advisory-level lake-effect, 1–3\" snow, gusty winds, but heavier action mainly west/south of Kent—yield about 10–25% snow-day rates, and Rockford specifically is known to hold school under these conditions once winter operations are up and running. Seasonal context and infrastructure both point to this being treated as routine winter weather. Safety: Road condition scores (around 5–6/10) and a ‘moderate’ risk label indicate slick but manageable travel, especially once plows and salt have worked through the 27th. The worst period for impacts is overnight through the morning of the 27th, not during the morning of the 28th when school would run. The safety assessment explicitly expects ‘normal school operations’ on the 28th. Given Michigan’s higher closure thresholds and the sub‑4\" accumulation, this lands squarely in the 5–15% guidance band. I’m setting the probability at 14% to reflect a small but non‑negligible chance that localized black ice or a persistent band over rural routes could trigger an unexpected closure or rare delay, while still emphasizing that a snow day is unlikely.",
