  "decision_rationale": "This decision hinges on a non-weather but decisive operational fact confirmed by multiple official Rockford Public Schools sources: **Monday, Feb 16, 2026 is a district-wide ‘No School’ day for Mid-Winter Break, and school resumes Tuesday Feb 17**. Because there is no instruction scheduled, the probability of a *weather-driven* snow day cancellation announcement for 2/16 is effectively near zero.\n\nWeather-wise, the provided meteorology/safety/infrastructure analyses agree there is **no accumulating snow** expected; the meaningful hazard is **freezing fog with very low visibility and patchy black ice** (especially bridges, rural low spots). That could matter more for travel advisories, staff operations, or community safety than for a closure decision on 2/16.\n\nThe only major conflict is the Web Weather Verifier showing Weather.com wind chills as low as **-23°F** (which would normally trigger the extreme-cold rule). However: (1) it is in stark conflict with the provided WeatherAPI forecast (~20s °F wind chills), (2) the verifier itself flags **date-alignment risk** (snippets not clearly tied to Mon 2/16 bus hours), and (3) even if it were true, Rockford Public Schools is **already closed** on 2/16 for break—so it does not create an additional ‘snow day’ decision for that date.\n\nNet: for Rockford on 2/16, the correct prediction for “snow day/closure due to weather” is very low because school is already off. The remaining 2% is reserved for edge cases (calendar mismatch, special programs unexpectedly operating, or an out-of-band emergency closure label).",
