    "No meaningful snow during the 6–8 AM bus window; only light accumulation signal (~0.6\") arrives late morning (~11 AM)",
    "Wind chill risk does NOT meet extreme-cold closure thresholds (best estimate wind chills in the teens; no credible ≤ -20°F signal)",
    "Main operational risk is localized: patchy black ice + reduced visibility from mist/low stratus near daybreak, mostly on untreated residential/rural roads and bridges",
    "No confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays for Mon Feb 2 in the FOX17 closings system or district sites checked (no domino pressure)",
    "Power grid risk is low and trending better (outages low and decreasing; no storm-driven outage scenario evident)"

  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs converge on a low-impact Monday morning for Rockford: light snow totals (~0.6\") with the first meaningful snow arriving after the start of school (around ~11 AM), and light-to-moderate winds. The only credible morning hazards are patchy fog/mist reducing visibility and the possibility of isolated black ice on untreated neighborhood/rural roads, bridges, and shaded curves—conditions that more commonly lead to targeted mitigation or (at most) a short delay if early route checks confirm slipping.\n\nKey conflict resolved: the Web Weather Verifier flagged a large discrepancy in ‘feels-like’ temperatures between WeatherAPI and some web pages. Follow-up meteorology synthesis indicates the more internally consistent solution is NOT arctic: 6–8 AM air temps roughly upper 20s to near 30°F with 12–18 mph winds, yielding wind chills in the teens. No credible pathway to ≤ -20°F wind chill exists with these temperature/wind ranges, so the automatic extreme-cold closure rule is not triggered.\n\nSecond-order/community signals: News intel found no active closings/delays on FOX17’s system and no dated Feb 2 closure/delay notices on Rockford or neighboring district pages checked—so there is no domino pressure toward closing. Infrastructure ground truth is limited (MiDrive fetch issues), but both forecast timing and typical operations support main roads being serviceable for the AM run; localized slick spots remain the only meaningful risk. Power-grid conditions are supportive of normal operations; outages appear low and decreasing.\n\nNet: full-day closure remains unlikely; the more realistic disruption mode is a 1–2 hour delay if early-morning route checks detect widespread patchy ice or visibility is materially worse than expected.",
