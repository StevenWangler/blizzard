    "Historical analogs for similar late-November advisory events in northern Kent County show roughly 5–20% closure rates, with delays more common than full snow days.",
    "Road crews in Kent County are experienced; primary routes and bus corridors are likely to be treated overnight, with conditions improving by Friday morning.",
    "Primary safety concern is patchy ice/black ice rather than deep snow or ongoing heavy precipitation at start time, which schools typically manage with caution rather than closure."

  "decision_rationale": "The meteorological data show a modest event by Michigan standards: about 1\" of additional snow, mixed wintry precip, and gusty winds under a Winter Weather Advisory. The heaviest/most variable conditions occur Thursday and taper by evening, with Friday morning expected to be dry, cold, and mainly cloudy. This gives plow and salt operations a full overnight window to address slick spots.\n\nHistorically, Rockford and surrounding Kent County districts almost never cancel for this combination alone—advisory-level lake-effect with 1–3\" totals, temps near 30°F, and improving conditions overnight. Analog patterns presented here cluster in the 5–20% closure range, and the more directly comparable examples are around 15–20%. The seasonal context further pushes odds down, as late-November events of this magnitude are routine and infrastructure is prepared.\n\nThe safety assessment highlights high ice risk and significant impact for the Thursday morning commute, but for the *following* school day (Friday) the situation is residual ice and slick patches rather than active heavy snow or rapidly worsening conditions. In West Michigan practice, that usually prompts slower routes, extra salting, and perhaps a delay if needed—not a full snow day. Considering the Michigan-specific thresholds (less than 4\" total, no major ice storm, no blizzard conditions at bus time), a low but non-negligible probability of closure is appropriate.\n\nBalancing meteorology, history, and safety, a decisively low probability near the upper end of the 5–15% guideline best fits the evidence, so I set the final closure chance at 18%, with a somewhat higher chance of a delay than a full snow day.",
