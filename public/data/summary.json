    "Morning commute temps are forecast well above freezing (roughly low/mid 40s °F); no widespread icing mechanism during 6–8 AM",
    "Precipitation during the decision window is rain/wet roads with possible fog/low stratus; snow/blowing snow is mainly an evening-after-school impact",
    "No active closure signals: Rockford Public Schools has no posted delay/closure; FOX17 closings page showed none; no confirmed neighboring-district closings found",
    "Infrastructure posture is normal (no plow operations needed); KCRC pretreat messaging appears focused on Friday evening freezing precip, not Friday AM",
    "Power grid conditions are routine (systemwide outages <~1,000 and decreasing); no indication of outage-driven closure risk"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All six inputs largely align on a low closure risk for Friday morning in Rockford. Meteorology and infrastructure both indicate above-freezing temperatures during bus hours with rain (not snow/freezing rain) and no plow/salt “catch-up” problem; that removes the most common Michigan closure triggers (ice accretion at commute time, heavy snow during routes, extreme cold). The only meaningful morning operational wildcard is visibility: fog/low stratus could briefly reduce safety, which historically leans more toward a short delay than a full closure. News intelligence strengthens the “open” expectation: no Rockford posting, no neighboring districts confirmed closed, and KCRC’s widely cited ‘ice storm’ preparation appears targeted at Friday evening (and in one article, a different Wed night/Thu window), not Friday’s AM commute. Power/outage conditions look normal and improving, so there’s no utility-driven closure signal. Net: recommend OPEN with monitoring; keep a delay option if dense fog (<0.5 mi in multiple route areas) or unexpected bridge slickness is observed around 5:45–6:15 AM.",
