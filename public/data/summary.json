  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Clear, dry, seasonably cold; 0% snow, 0.0\" accumulation, good visibility, dry roads; essentially 0% weather-closure risk.\n- Historian: Very similar past patterns have a 1–3% closure rate, usually for non-weather reasons; high confidence that conditions like this almost never close schools in West-Central Michigan.\n- Safety Analyst: Roads and travel are rated very good (9/10 primary & secondary, 8/10 parking lots), low risk, minimal commute impact, and explicit statement that there is no meteorological justification for a snow day or delay.\n- News/Community Intel: No closure announcements, no neighboring district closures, and only older notices about earlier deteriorating conditions on Dec. 3; current signals lean toward normal operations.\n\nAll four experts fundamentally agree: conditions are routine winter cold with dry roads and no active storm. There are no real conflicts, only slightly different framing of the same conclusion (very low risk of closure).\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Meteorology and safety both agree: no new snow from midnight through the school day.\n- That means plows are mostly idle; roads remain in a stable, frozen, treated state.\n- Morning bus window around 6:00–7:40 AM occurs many hours after any prior event; there is no ongoing accumulation to clear.\n- Effective \"plow window\" from the last meaningful weather impact (early on 12/4) to the start of school on 12/5 is on the order of 24 hours or more – far more than enough for Michigan crews.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: 0% precip, 0 snow/ice accumulation, dry conditions through Friday.\n- Historian: Any earlier thin glaze from 12/4 has \"a full day of treatment and traffic\" before Friday.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk labeled moderate in the abstract, but narrative clarifies this mainly as typical residual spots (shaded black ice, old patches), not an active icing event. Overall risk still rated low with clear roads.\n\nThere is no active ice storm, no freezing rain in the forecast, and no evidence of widespread refreeze right before commute time. This does NOT reach the \"ice changes everything\" category used in the Michigan thresholds.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel explicitly lists neighboring_district_closures: [] (none).\n- No local media or RPS posts suggest a planned closure or delay for Friday.\n- Community sentiment is tagged as \"uncertain,\" but with no concrete movement toward calling off school and no new cancellations beyond Dec. 3.\n\nBecause there are zero neighboring closures and no strong community expectation of closing, there is no upward adjustment from the news-intel side. The earlier Dec. 3 disruption is now stale context, not a live signal for Dec. 5.\n\n5. Applying Michigan-specific thresholds\n- Snow: Forecast 0\" vs. thresholds:\n  - <4\" → 5–15% in Michigan.\n  - Here we have 0\", so we are even more routine than that lower band.\n- Ice: No active ice event; only residual, spotty risk. Does not qualify for the 60–85% or higher tiers.\n- Blizzard/visibility: None; visibility ~6 miles, modest winds, no falling or blowing snow.\n- Cold: Wind chills above +5°F, well above the -15°F threshold typically considered for cold-only closures.\n\nSo the event falls below even the lowest snow-related risk tier. Historically and operationally, this is a standard winter school day.\n\n6. Weighting the experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Effectively 0% closure odds based on weather; I translate that to ~1% to avoid a literal zero.\n- Safety (25%): Explicitly recommends normal operations and sees no justification for a snow day; ~1–2% risk.\n- History (20%): Historical closure rate 1–3% for similar patterns; I anchor at 2%.\n- News Intel (20%): No closure buzz, no neighboring closures, no district pre-announcements; slightly ABOVE pure weather because there was a recent storm, but still only ~3–4% to account for any late operational surprise.\n\nWeighted blend (rounded):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 * 1% ≈ 0.35\n- Safety: 0.25 * 2% ≈ 0.50\n- History: 0.20 * 2% ≈ 0.40\n- News Intel: 0.20 * 4% ≈ 0.80\nTotal ≈ 2.05%, which I round to 2%.\n\n7. Avoiding the 40–60% zone and Brier score logic\nThe experts are NOT in meaningful disagreement, so there is no basis for a mid-range (40–60%) probability. The right move for Brier score is to be decisive and stay very low given the overwhelming evidence. If school is open (very likely), a 2% forecast yields a small squared error (0.02² = 0.0004), which is excellent. Raising this number without justification would materially worsen Brier performance.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A sudden, unforecast overnight event: surprise lake-effect band, unmodeled freezing drizzle, or an unexpected secondary wave causing real accumulation or glazing before 6–7 AM.\n- A non-weather operational decision: lingering damage or equipment failures from the earlier storm, a major bus fleet issue, or a precautionary closure unrelated to Friday’s actual weather.\n- A very late-breaking collective decision by multiple neighboring districts based on information not yet reflected in the feeds (e.g., a shared concern about specific back roads or staffing).\n\nGiven current data near 2025-12-04T14:04Z, those scenarios are low probability. Overall, the convergence of all four expert domains supports an extremely low chance of a snow day.\n\nFinal call: Predict Rockford Public Schools will be OPEN with no weather-related delay on Friday, December 5, 2025, with a snow-day probability of about 2% and very high confidence.",
