  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts align that Monday is a “cold + lingering slick spots” morning, not a storm (no accumulating snow, no freezing rain). Main hazards are patchy black ice and a brief early visibility dip.\n2) Disagreement: Only major conflict was the web verifier’s earlier apparent ≤-20°F feels-like trigger from Weather.com. Fresh verifier follow-up indicates those Weather.com values were tied to earlier dates (stale/cached) and are not credible evidence for Mon 1/26 6–9 AM. With that resolved, the consensus remains low closure odds.\n3) Plow timing math: With no new snowfall, there’s no ‘snow end → plow buffer’ constraint. Infrastructure indicates priority routes likely in best shape by ~05:30–06:30; residential loops may still have packed/icy patches at 06:30.\n4) Any ice? Yes—moderate risk of patchy black ice/refreeze on untreated/shaded surfaces and bridge decks, but not a widespread glaze event.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Monday closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts at this time.\n6) Power: Power-grid check shows very low systemwide outages and no verified Rockford-specific facility outages.\n7) Wind chill trigger: Not confirmed for Monday; most likely near 0°F during bus hours.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) a surprise episode of freezing fog/ice fog producing widespread glaze, (b) an unforecast burst of light snow/lake-effect reducing traction/visibility, (c) a localized but significant Rockford-area power outage impacting school buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% + Web verification 5% → strongly against closure (dry, modest winds; cold but not threshold). Safety 20% + Infrastructure 10% → supports only a small tail risk (patchy ice on residential routes). News 15% → no closure signals to bump up. History 15% → analogs suggest ~3–6% closure; adjusted slightly upward due to residual ice/visibility window. Power 10% → no outage-driven override. Net: 11% snow day probability (more likely normal opening; small chance of a 2-hour delay if black ice/fog verifies worse than expected).",
