  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. disagreement\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorology: Cold but quiet; 0\" new snow, essentially 0% chance of overnight snow or ice, no storm during the 6–8 AM commute.\n  • Safety: Road risk low; primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, minimal commute impact, only patchy refreeze on untreated areas.\n  • History: Very strong analog pattern to normal school days; historical snow-day rates 2–8% in similar setups; seasonally adjusted expectation even lower.\n  • News/Intel: No closure announcements for Rockford or nearby Kent County districts; coverage focuses on weekend event and power/outage issues, not a Monday storm.\n  All four specialists independently point to a normal school day with only minor residual slick spots.\n\n- Disagreement:\n  • Only minor nuance: the safety analyst flags a “moderate” ice-formation risk on untreated/shaded spots, while meteorology emphasizes no actual ice storm or freezing rain signal. This is not a conflict—just a reminder about refreeze on leftover moisture.\n  • Community sentiment is labeled “uncertain,” but there is no strong push either for or against closure; this aligns with the broader low-risk picture.\n  There are no substantive conflicts requiring probability inflation.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Last accumulating snow: Saturday into early Sunday, with 1–4\" regionally, then a dry, breezy, overcast Sunday.\n- Forecast window for concern: Sunday evening through Monday morning commute (roughly 18:00 Sunday to 08:00 Monday).\n- Available cleanup window: At least 12–18 hours of cold, dry weather before first buses around ~6:30–7:00 AM and high school start near 7:40 AM.\n- With Kent County’s plow capacity and a quiet, dry overnight, road crews have ample time to clear main routes and salt problem spots. This matches the safety analyst’s high road-condition scores and “minimal” commute impact.\n\n3. Ice assessment\n- Meteorology: 0.00\" liquid, 0% modeled chance of new precip overnight; no freezing rain/drizzle indicated.\n- Safety: “Moderate” ice-formation risk strictly from refreeze of weekend moisture on untreated or shaded surfaces; not a widespread glaze or black-ice event.\n- History: Notes quick temperature swings can create patchy slick spots, but with a full dry day before Monday, these usually do not trigger district-wide closures.\n  Conclusion: There is no ice storm or broad icing event—only localized refreeze that custodial and road crews can manage with targeted salting.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior & community signals\n- News intel clearly states:\n  • No current closure or delay announcements for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, etc., for Monday Jan 12.\n  • Rockford’s own calendar shows a normal day with no weather alerts.\n  • No domino closure pattern and no major Monday storm messaging from local media or NWS for Rockford.\n- Per the decision rules, a +15–20% bump would require 3+ neighboring districts closing; instead, we have zero announced closures and no indication of impending ones. So there is no upward adjustment from news/community signals.\n\n5. Translating to a snow-day probability\n- Base from meteorology (weight 35%): With 0\" new snow, no storm, and typical Michigan winter cold, the meteorological snow-day probability aligns with the guidance for <4\": about 5–10%. I set this at ~7%.\n- Safety lens (25%): Low risk, strong road scores, minimal commute impact. This supports the low end of possible values, around 5–8%. I weight at ~6%.\n- Historical lens (20%): Similar patterns historically close schools ~2–8% of the time; seasonal adjustment is negative (-0.15), reinforcing the low end. I weight at ~5%.\n- News/Intel lens (20%): No closures, no public expectation of a storm day, and no domino effect. This justifies staying at or slightly below the meteorological base, around 4–6%. I weight at ~5%.\n\nWeighted combination (approximate):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 × 7% ≈ 2.5%\n- Safety: 0.25 × 6% ≈ 1.5%\n- History: 0.20 × 5% ≈ 1.0%\n- News: 0.20 × 5% ≈ 1.0%\nTotal ≈ 6%. Rounding to a clean, decisive figure consistent with Michigan <4\" thresholds (5–15%), and given that all experts point clearly toward a normal day, I choose 5%.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThis call would be wrong (actual closure when I predicted 5%) if any of the following occur:\n- A late-developing, poorly modeled band of lake-effect or light snow forms Sunday night, dropping several inches right over Rockford between ~2–7 AM, reducing road visibility and overwhelming plow timing.\n- Unexpected freezing drizzle or a thin glaze develops despite current dry forecasts, creating much more widespread ice than the “patchy refreeze” currently expected.\n- Power outages from prior wind events spread or persist specifically in Rockford, forcing closure for infrastructure reasons despite decent roads.\n- District leadership opts for an unusually cautious closure based on localized reports or bus-route-specific issues that are not yet reflected in current data.\nGiven the current analyses and signals, these are low-probability, higher-uncertainty edge cases, which is why the forecast remains at the very low but non-zero 5% level.\n\nOverall judgment: All four expert domains converge on a quiet, cold, post-storm Monday with normal operations, minor residual slick spots, and no strong institutional or community pressure for closure. That supports a confident, clearly sub-10% snow-day probability, set at 5%.",
