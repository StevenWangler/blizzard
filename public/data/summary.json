  "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. AGREEMENT ACROSS EXPERTS\n- Meteorologist: No snow overnight or during the 6–9 AM commute; about 2\" of snow mainly 12–4 PM; temps below freezing; all-snow event, no ice.\n- Safety Analyst: Confirms minimal morning-commute impact, significant but manageable afternoon impact; roads generally 7–8.5/10 with moderate risk; Friday’s issue is PM conditions, not morning hazards.\n- Historian: Analog days with similar timing and totals in West Michigan almost always have school in session; historical snow-day rate about 5–10% for this pattern.\n- News Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closures yet for Friday; no strong community drumbeat that it will be a snow day.\nAll four agree this is a typical, manageable winter day with main problems in the afternoon, not a classic snow-day setup.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\n- There is no substantive conflict. Earlier visibility estimates (1–3 miles vs. 3–6 miles) differ slightly but both describe non-blizzard, manageable conditions. Safety labels risk as “moderate,” but clearly in the context of PM travel, not system-shutdown. No expert suggests high closure likelihood.\nBecause there is no strong conflict, heavy cross-correction is unnecessary; cross-check confirmed key details like lack of morning precip and absence of ice.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Snow onset: around 12:00 PM Friday.\n- Peak/worst conditions: ~12:00–18:30 Friday.\n- End of appreciable snow: roughly 16:00, with lighter snow/blowing lingering to about 18:30.\n- Available plow window: from ~18:30 Friday to ~07:40 Saturday bus time ≈ 13 hours (or ~15.5 hours if you consider the main accumulation done by 16:00).\n- Safety analyst explicitly states this is more than enough time for Michigan road crews to clear 2\" + light additional snow. There is no plow-capacity constraint forcing a closure on Friday itself.\nPlow timing is crystal clear: no overnight accumulation issue before school, ample cleanup time after.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorological and cross-check analyses: Precip type is snow only; temps stay below freezing with no setup for liquid precip in the morning.\n- Cross-check experts: Explicitly confirms no freezing rain or mixed precip during 6–9 AM; dry but cold roads.\n- Safety: Ice risk labeled “moderate” only in the sense of slick, compacted or snowy surfaces, not active glaze ice.\nThere is no significant freezing-rain or mixed-precip event; conditions are wintery but not ice-driven.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News Intel: As of the evening check, no confirmed Friday closures or delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent City, Grand Rapids, or Rockford itself.\n- No regional TV closing lists show a domino wave for Friday yet; community sentiment is described as “uncertain,” not “definitely closed.”\nPer the rules, zero neighboring closures means no upward adjustment for community/region behavior.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThis forecast would underestimate closure chances if:\n- The snow band intensifies or shifts to produce 6\"+ in a short window before or during the early commute (which current data do not support), or\n- A surprise freezing-rain or heavy sleet episode develops in the pre-dawn hours, sharply degrading traction and visibility, or\n- Overnight decisions by multiple nearby districts move suddenly toward closure for reasons not seen in current data (e.g., local staffing/transport issues or hyper-local whiteout bands), creating a domino effect.\nGiven the current tools and cross-checks, those are low-probability but non-zero tail risks.\n\nPROBABILITY CALCULATION AND WEIGHTING\nBaseline from Michigan thresholds:\n- Forecast snow total: ~2\" during the day, possibly <4\" in 24 hours. For Michigan, <4\" corresponds to a 5–15% range.\n- Timing: No morning accumulation, snow mainly midday/afternoon.\n- No ice, no blizzard, no extreme cold.\nThis puts the raw meteorological probability near the bottom of the threshold range, ~8–10%.\n\nExpert weightings (per instructions):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Meteorologist and cross-check both clearly say typical snow-onset-during-school-day, no morning hazard, low closure likelihood. This anchors the estimate near 10%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Safety assigns a “moderate” risk focused on afternoon travel, but explicitly recommends normal start and emphasizes manageability. This argues against closure, perhaps nudging probability slightly upward only to recognize some PM travel concern, say up to ~10–12%.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs show 5–10% closure rates, with strong confidence. This keeps the probability in the low single-digit to low-teens band, reinforcing a figure around 8–10%.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon): No neighboring Friday closures, no Rockford alert, no strong “it’s definitely a snow day” sentiment. Per your rules, we apply no positive adjustment; if anything, the absence of a closure wave nudges us toward the lower end of the range.\n\nCombining: The weighted synthesis supports a value near the low edge of the 5–15% Michigan band. To stay numerically sharp for Brier scoring but still acknowledge non-zero tail risks (unexpected banding, last-minute superintendent caution), I set:\n- Final snow day probability = 10%.\nThe confidence is high because all four expert domains align and real-time intel shows no early closure signals.\n\nWHY AVOID 40–60%\nThe situation is not genuinely uncertain with conflicting evidence; instead, all signals—the forecast, safety assessment, history, and news/community data—point in the same direction: a typical winter day with manageable but significant afternoon snow. That justifies a clearly low probability rather than a hedged 40–60% call.\n\nRECOMMENDATION SUMMARY\n- Operational recommendation: Proceed with a normal school day on Friday, Jan 16.\n- Focus risk management resources on the afternoon: pre-treatment before noon, active plowing/salting during 12–5 PM, and strong communication about slower PM bus runs and after-school travel.\n- Continue to monitor short-fuse advisories and closing lists in case conditions or decisions change overnight, but based on current evidence, a snow day is unlikely.",
