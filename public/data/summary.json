  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorology: Cold, quiet Monday with 0\" new snow, light winds, good visibility, storm already over. Explicitly states snow‑day likelihood is very low.\n- Safety: Roads mostly good (8–9/10), moderate risk only for refreeze/black ice on side streets and lots around 5–8 AM; recommends normal operations, no snow day or delay indicated.\n- History: Nearly identical past patterns in Rockford/West Michigan yield only ~2–5% closure rate; schools almost always open under cold-but-dry, post‑storm conditions.\n- News/Intel: No RPS closure notices, no neighboring district closures, no high‑impact storm headlines for Kent County, and community sentiment is not pushing for cancellation.\nAll four point to school being open; there is no significant conflict.\n\n2. Disagreements or ambiguities:\n- The only mild tension is that the safety assessment labels overall risk as “moderate,” but its own details support manageable conditions (good primary roads, modest black‑ice risk). Meteorology and history lean even more strongly toward low risk. This is not a true conflict, more a conservative framing by safety.\n- No expert suggests ice storm, freezing rain, or active snowfall coincident with the commute.\n\n3. Plow timing math (storm end → 7:40 AM):\n- Snow from the weekend event ends well before midnight Sunday.\n- Typical first bus / high school start window in Rockford is around 6:30–7:40 AM Monday.\n- That yields roughly 7–9+ hours of completely dry conditions (no new precip) before buses are running, under clear/cold high pressure—ideal for plowing and salting.\n- Safety scores (primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, lots 8/10) confirm this timing is sufficient for crews to get ahead of the clean‑up.\nThis implies plow timing is favorable and does NOT justify a closure.\n\n4. Ice considerations:\n- No freezing rain or mixed precip is forecast—precipitation probability is essentially 0% overnight and in the morning.\n- The only ice risk is secondary: refreeze/black ice from leftover moisture as temps bottom near 10–13°F around 5–7 AM.\n- Safety explicitly frames this as patchy risk on side streets, shaded stretches, bridges, and parking lots—not widespread sheet ice.\n- With pre‑treatment and targeted salting, this is a routine winter hazard in Michigan, not a closure‑level ice situation.\nTherefore, ‘ice changes everything’ does not apply here; this is ordinary refreeze, not an ice storm.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals:\n- News intel shows: no neighboring district closures reported, no early dismissal history flagged, and no developing closure chains.\n- RPS website lists a normal schedule for the week of Dec 8, and there are no alert banners or posts hinting at concern for Monday.\n- Community/social media sentiment is described as “uncertain,” not strongly pushing for cancellation, and there are no power outages or major event cancellations.\nUnder the weighting rules, lack of neighboring closures and neutral community chatter means we make NO positive adjustment to the probability.\n\n6. Quantitative synthesis with weighting:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Very low likelihood, effectively in the ~5–10% band given 0\" new snow, no storm, manageable wind chills. I anchor this at ~7%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Acknowledges moderate localized risk but recommends normal operations. That aligns with perhaps ~10–15% closure probability. I use ~12% here.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analog closure rates 2–5%. I set this at ~4%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): No closure signals or chains, so this supports the low baseline, ~5–8%. I set ~6%.\nWeighted blend (before any Michigan‑threshold adjustment):\n- 0.35*7 + 0.25*12 + 0.20*4 + 0.20*6 ≈ 2.45 + 3 + 0.8 + 1.2 ≈ 7.45%.\nThis aligns closely with Michigan threshold guidance: with <4\" of new snow (0\" in this case) and no storm, a 5–15% range is normal. Conditions and expert consensus put us on the lower end of that band.\n\n7. Michigan threshold framing:\n- New snow on Monday: 0\" (way below the <4\" category) → base 5–15%.\n- No blizzard, no ice storm, no 8+\" totals hitting during school hours.\n- Wind chills flirt with, but do not sit firmly below, Rockford’s common cold‑day thresholds at bus time.\n- No neighboring districts closed → no +15–20% bump.\n- Community not demanding closure → no +10–15% bump.\nGiven all that, I select 7%: firmly in the low, but not 0%, recognizing minor black‑ice pockets and briefly borderline wind chills.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\nDownside risks that could raise the actual closure chance:\n- An unforecast band of light snow or freezing drizzle late Sunday night, creating more widespread slick roads than current data shows.\n- Colder-than-expected wind chills (e.g., sustained below -15°F exactly at bus time) combined with any bus/mechanical issues.\n- A surprise chain reaction where multiple nearby districts decide to close early Monday based on localized conditions that aren’t yet visible in guidance.\nAt present, none of these are indicated in the expert inputs, so they are low‑probability edge cases.\n\nGiven the strong multi‑expert consensus, clear plow window, lack of active weather, and Michigan’s higher tolerance, the best calibrated forecast for Rockford, MI on Monday, 2025-12-08 is a very low snow‑day probability around 7%, with high confidence that school will be open on time.",
