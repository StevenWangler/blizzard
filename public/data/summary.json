    "Rockford Public Schools is already scheduled CLOSED district-wide for Mid Winter Break on Fri 2026-02-13 (not weather-related).",
    "No accumulating snow or active ice/freezing rain signal; main weather issue is freezing fog/mist and potentially near-zero visibility around the pre-dawn/bus window.",
    "Patchy black ice/glaze is possible on bridges/overpasses and untreated rural/local streets from freezing fog despite 0\" precip—typically managed with spot-treating and cautious operations.",
    "Power grid is stable with only isolated outages reported statewide; no evidence of a power-driven closure trigger.",
    "Web wind-chill conflict exists (one stale Weather.com snippet near -19°F), but no credible source shows ≤ -20°F during 6–8 AM, and Rockford is closed anyway for break."
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "All experts converge that this is not a plowable-snow event: no snowfall, no meaningful precipitation, modest winds, and temperatures in the low 20s rising through the morning. The only meaningful *weather* hazard is freezing fog/mist producing (a) very poor visibility and (b) isolated black-ice/glaze on bridges/overpasses and untreated rural/local roads. Historically, that setup rarely produces a full district-wide closure in West Michigan; at most it tends to produce caution messaging or an occasional delay when visibility is persistently near-zero.\n\nHowever, the News Intelligence Agent verified via multiple official Rockford Public Schools sources (homepage reminders, district calendar, academic calendar, district news, and superintendent update) that Fri Feb 13, 2026 is already a scheduled district-wide NO SCHOOL day for Mid Winter Break. Therefore, the probability of an *additional weather-driven snow day/closure announcement* for Rockford Public Schools is extremely low.\n\nWhat would make this wrong? If the user’s target is not Rockford Public Schools (e.g., a private program still running), then freezing fog could still justify localized cancellations/delays; and if any credible source updates to wind chill ≤ -20°F at 6–8 AM, closure probability would jump per safety rules (not currently indicated in the provided evidence).",
