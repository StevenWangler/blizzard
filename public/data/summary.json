  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist:\n1) Expert agreement: All four agree snowfall is not the driver (near 0\"), and the main risks are (a) extreme wind chill in the morning commute window and (b) ice/black-ice potential from a brief freezing-rain/refreeze period overnight.\n2) Disagreements: The key conflict was whether roads would be ‘mostly OK’ by 6–8 AM. Follow-up safety analysis clarified that with pavement temps dropping into very low single digits/below ~10°F, salt effectiveness is sharply reduced and ice risk—especially on secondary roads/bridges—should be treated as HIGH into the commute window.\n3) Plow timing math: Freezing rain ending ~02:00 to ~07:40 start is ~5h 40m. That’s enough time for operations, but also enough time for any residual moisture to refreeze hard; main roads can improve via traffic/scouring, while side streets can remain bonded slick.\n4) Any ice?: Yes—freezing rain is explicitly forecast around midnight, and temps fall to ~0°F by 06:00 with wind chills ~-20 to -23°F, so any glaze/black ice would persist.\n5) Neighboring districts: Only a confirmed Thursday closure (Forest Hills). No confirmed Friday (1/23) closures/delays for Rockford or multiple nearby districts were found in available scans, so I did not apply the +15–20% ‘3+ districts closed’ bump.\n6) What would make me wrong?: (a) If freezing rain produces more than a trace glaze (widespread bonded ice on neighborhoods/rural routes), closure odds jump sharply. (b) If Rockford uses a strict wind-chill threshold (≤ -20°F) for busing/walking, closure odds also jump. (c) Conversely, if the freezing rain is negligible and roads are dry, this becomes a ‘cold-only’ event where delays are more likely than closures.\n\nWeighted synthesis (per system weights):\n- Meteorology (30%): Strong confidence in extreme cold/wind chills; low confidence in additional snow. Supports elevated risk mainly from exposure + refreeze, but not a slam-dunk closure.\n- Safety (20%): After clarification, ice risk is HIGH into 5:30–8 AM due to reduced salt effectiveness and bonded black ice potential—this is the main upward driver.\n- History (15%): Cold alone usually yields normal/delay; closure becomes more common when cold coincides with confirmed slickness. This keeps probability below ‘likely’ but above baseline.\n- News intel (15%): No Friday closure confirmations; only Thursday neighboring closure and regional advisories. This prevents a major upward domino adjustment.\n\nBottom line: With wind chills near -20 to -25°F and a plausible black-ice morning (and salt less effective), a full closure is more plausible than a routine Michigan day, but the lack of accumulating snow and absence of confirmed Friday district-closure clustering keeps it in the mid-30s. A DELAY is more likely than a full closure under the most probable scenario.",
