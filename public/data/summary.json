    "Michigan-specific thresholds: 6–10\" without active heavy snow or ice during the commute historically leads to school staying open, especially in well-prepared corridors like Rockford/Kent County.",
    "Historical analogs for similar \"storm ending a day before\" patterns show snow day rates mainly in the 15–25% range when roads have had a full day for cleanup.",
    "Safety assessment indicates primary roads likely in fair-to-good shape, with secondary roads and lots slick but passable—risk level labeled moderate, consistent with cautious travel rather than closure."

  "decision_rationale": "Given Michigan’s higher tolerance for snow, the key is not total accumulation but timing and severity during the Monday commute. The Winter Storm Warning with 6–10\" is substantial, but the worst snow and visibility occur Saturday afternoon–night into Sunday morning. The warning ends by late Sunday morning, leaving Sunday daytime and overnight for plowing and salting. Meteorological data for Monday show only light additional snow (~0.5\"), subfreezing but not extreme cold, modest winds, and visibility generally above 1 mile. Historical pattern analysis for West Michigan indicates that when a significant storm wraps up a full day before school, districts like Rockford typically hold school, with closures more likely when heavy snow, ice, or whiteout conditions coincide directly with the commute. The safety assessment likewise points to moderate risk: primary roads 7/10, secondary roads and lots 5/10, with high ice risk but conditions that are manageable with standard winter operations. Combining these, a full snow day is possible but not probable—more consistent with roughly a 20–25% chance. To stay decisive while reflecting the data, I set the probability at 22%, favoring a normal start or, at most, a brief delay over cancellation.",
