  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: Meteorology, Safety, History, News all agree Wednesday is a mostly-dry ‘cleanup/refreeze’ day; the main hazard is residual ice/packed snow, not new accumulation. Power grid risk is low (no widespread outages). \n2) Disagreement: Web verifier flags a potential ≤ -20°F wind chill from a Weather.com snapshot, sharply conflicting with the provided WeatherAPI hourly (feels-like around +3°F to +4°F in the 6–9 AM window). This is unresolved because authoritative NWS hourly wind chill could not be fetched in-tool.\n3) Plow timing math: Infrastructure expectation is trunklines/arterials driveable by ~06:30, county connectors passable but slick, and local streets can remain packed/glazed until 08:00–11:00. That supports ‘open or delay’ more than closure.\n4) Ice: Yes—moderate refreeze/black-ice risk is the primary pathway to disruption.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed closures/delays found on official web surfaces during the latest scan.\n6) Power: Outages appear extremely limited statewide (~0.01%); not a closure driver.\n7) Wind chill verification: Not confirmed by multiple sources here; only a conflicting Weather.com snapshot suggests ≤ -20°F, so I cannot apply the near-automatic closure rule with high confidence.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) wind chills truly ≤ -20°F for several hours at bus-stop time (many districts close for that alone), or (b) Tuesday’s icing was more widespread than assumed, leaving systemic traction failure on many bus routes early Wednesday.\n\nWeighting the experts per directive: Meteorology (25%) + Safety (25%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (5%) + Web verifier (5%). Baseline from the consensus debate is ~12%.\n- I keep the base low because there’s near-zero new snow and no confirmed domino closures.\n- I bump modestly upward (+3%) due to the unresolved wind-chill discrepancy and infrastructure’s note that local streets may remain snow-covered/icy into mid-morning.\n\nFinal: 15% chance of a full snow day (closure). A 2-hour delay is the more plausible disruption if early route checks find widespread glaze.",
