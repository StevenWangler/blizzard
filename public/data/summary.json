  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: Storm impacts for Rockford, MI peak over the weekend, with only a brief ~0.25\" snow burst late Monday evening and no accumulating snow during the Monday morning commute.\n- History: Very similar to past post‑storm Mondays where schools are open—cold, snow‑covered ground, but no active storm, no blizzard, no extreme cold. Historical snow‑day rates for this pattern are 5–20%, with the closest match at ~5%.\n- Safety: Risk level rated \"low\"; primary and secondary roads expected to be largely cleared by Monday with only moderate refreeze risk on untreated surfaces. Morning and afternoon commute impacts both labeled \"minimal.\"\n- News/Intel: No Rockford (MI)–specific Winter Storm Warning for Monday, no official closure chatter, no neighboring district closures, and community sentiment is weather‑aware but not expecting an obvious snow day.\nAll four agree there is **no major active storm or extreme hazard during Monday’s school hours** and that conditions are consistent with a typical winter school day in West Michigan.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\n- There are no major conflicts. The only mild tension is the safety analyst flagging \"moderate\" ice formation risk on untreated surfaces versus meteorology noting no explicit ice storm or mixed precip. These are compatible: with temps in the teens/20s°F after a big storm, some refreeze and black ice are expected on side streets/sidewalks, but not at a level that typically drives district‑wide closure in Michigan.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Main heavy storm: Friday–Sunday, with the Winter Storm Warning ending 10 AM Sunday.\n- School start/first bus windows Monday: roughly 6:00–7:40 AM, 2025-12-01.\n- Plow/salt window after warning expiration: from ~10 AM Sunday through very early Monday.\nThat’s ~20+ hours of daylight and overnight work time between the end of the warning and the first bus pickups, plus the storm had already been ongoing before that. This is ample for Kent County crews—who are experienced with large events—to clear primary and most secondary roads, with only isolated slick spots left.\n\n4. ICE / MIXED PRECIPITATION RISK\n- Meteorology explicitly indicates all snow, no glaze, no freezing rain, and light winds.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing, so the only realistic ice hazard is **refreeze of melt or compacted snow**, not an ice storm.\n- Safety flags this as \"moderate\" risk on untreated areas (sidewalks, side streets, parking lots), which is well within the range districts normally manage via salting and caution, not closure.\nNo evidence of a dedicated ice event that would elevate closure risk into a high range.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- News intel finds **no neighboring district closures or early announcements** (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD all quiet for Monday).\n- No power outages, no large local event cancellations, and no social media consensus that “there’s no way we have school.”\n- Coverage focuses on **weekend** travel trouble and on Rockford, Illinois—not Rockford, Michigan—underscoring that Monday’s AM commute in Kent County is not a primary concern.\nUnder the given rules, the absence of neighboring closures means **no upward adjustment** to probability.\n\n6. QUANTITATIVE PROBABILITY AND WEIGHTING\nBase assessment by domain:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Post‑storm cleanup day, no Monday‑morning snow, no blizzard/ice, temps manageable. Independent closure likelihood from weather alone ≈ 5–10%. I use **8%** here.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low risk, minimal commute impacts, good main roads, known refreeze issues but manageable with salting. Implied closure probability ≈ **5–10%**, I set **7%**.\n- History (20% weight): Closest analog pattern has about a **5%** closure rate; other broader post‑storm patterns run 15–20% but involve more active weather than forecast here. Weighted historical closure risk ≈ **7%**.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): No closure announcements, no neighbor closures, no strong “snow day buzz.” In Michigan, real pre‑closure chatter or early decisions would typically start surfacing if risk were moderate or higher. This strongly supports a **low** probability, ≈ **5–8%**, I set **6%**.\n\nWeighted blend:\n(0.35 × 8) + (0.25 × 7) + (0.20 × 7) + (0.20 × 6)\n= 2.8 + 1.75 + 1.4 + 1.2 ≈ 7.15%\n\nThreshold guidance for Michigan:\n- New Monday snow: ~0.25\" (well under 4\") → nominally in the 5–15% band.\n- No ice storm, no 8+\" event actively affecting the commute, and storm timing strongly favors open school.\nThat places the district solidly in the **low end** of the state‑specific range. To avoid false precision and to stay consistent with both domain and historical context, I round to **8%**.\n\n7. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Upside risk (probability actually higher):\n  • Plows fall badly behind—e.g., localized drifting or unmodeled lake‑effect bands Sunday night leave many secondary roads snow‑packed and slick by 4–5 AM.\n  • A poorly forecast band of lake‑effect or clipper snow sets up over Rockford 3–8 AM Monday with 1–3\" at commute time.\n  • Significant, unexpected ice development (e.g., localized freezing drizzle or a thin glaze) that’s not captured in current guidance.\n- Downside risk (probability actually lower):\n  • Road crews perform better than average, sidewalks and lots are very clean, and community sentiment by Sunday night is strongly “roads are fine,” making closure extremely unlikely (<5%).\n\nGiven the alignment of all four expert domains and the absence of strong closure signals, the most defensible, Brier‑score‑minded call is **a low but non‑zero 8% chance of a snow day** and a clear recommendation to plan for **normal school operations**.\n",
