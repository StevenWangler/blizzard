    "Snow amount/timing: forecast accumulation is modest (~0.7\") and appears to end around ~11 PM Sunday, leaving ~7.5 hours for overnight plowing/treatment before the ~6:30 AM bus window",
    "Cold/refreeze risk: very cold pavement temps mean residual slush/packed snow can polish into slick spots on bridges, intersections, hills, and shaded rural segments",
    "Road hierarchy mismatch: MDOT trunklines and main arterials likely passable by morning, but neighborhood/local streets and bus turnarounds may remain packed/slick at bell time",
    "No confirmed Mon 1/26 closure wave: district sites for Rockford and nearby districts show no Mon 1/26 closure/delay announcements yet; community buzz is minimal/unclear",
    "Wind chill trigger not met for Monday: web verification suggests Monday AM wind chills roughly in the -10°F to -19°F range (dangerous but not the ≤-20°F near-automatic closure threshold)",
    "Power grid not a driver: outage snapshot indicates extremely low outages and a decreasing trend; unlikely to force a closure absent a localized school-specific outage"

  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement across experts: All teams converge on “not a big snowstorm” for Rockford; the main risk is cold + refreeze/packed snow rather than heavy snow, high wind, or whiteout. Most likely outcome is OPEN, with some chance of a DELAY.\n2) Disagreements: The only material conflict was the safety/infrastructure ‘worst conditions until 03:00’ vs the hourly precip ending around 23:00 Sunday. Follow-up resolved this: 03:00 was not supported by the provided hours; worst conditions are better defined as ~18:00–23:00 with a post-snow hazard tail to ~01:00.\n3) Plow timing math: Using snow ending ~23:00 Sunday, there are ~7.5 hours until ~06:30 bus rollout and ~8 hours 40 minutes until ~07:40 start—typically enough for trunklines and main arterials. The limiting factor remains neighborhood streets/turnarounds.\n4) Ice: No explicit freezing rain signal for Sunday night in the provided forecast (precip type = snow), but ice formation/refreeze risk is elevated due to extreme cold and earlier-period icing context. This raises delay risk more than full-closure risk.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Mon 1/26 closure/delay announcements found on district sites in a targeted scan (Rockford, Forest Hills, Northview, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Kent ISD postings). This removes a major upward adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Updated snapshot shows very low outages and decreasing trend; no evidence of a power-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verification indicates Monday AM feels-like roughly -10 to -19°F, not ≤ -20°F at bus time. The ≤ -20°F value exists in WeatherAPI ‘current’ for Fri 1/23, but that does not automatically carry to Mon 1/26.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) an unforecast lake-effect band persists/redevelops overnight Sun→Mon producing several inches or reducing visibility during 5–8 AM; (b) widespread hidden glaze/black ice forms on secondary roads; (c) a localized outage/heating failure hits one or more schools; (d) Monday wind chill trends colder than expected and crosses ≤ -20°F at bus time.\n\nWeighted decision (per directive): Meteorology (25%) supports low closure risk given <1\" and ending before commute; Safety (20%) and Infrastructure (10%) keep risk above ‘near-zero’ due to local streets/turnarounds + refreeze; History (15%) base rates for this pattern are low; News Intel (15%) finds no active Mon closure wave; Power (10%) not a driver; Web verification (5%) removes the ≤ -20°F Monday trigger. Result: 18% probability of a full snow-day closure (higher for a delay than a closure).",
