    "Ice-first setup: freezing drizzle/freezing rain risk overnight into early morning with temps ~29°F at bus time (thin glaze/black ice potential on secondary roads, bridges, and subdivisions)",
    "Bad timing: slickest window overlaps 5:30–8:00 AM bus/commute period; light snow around ~6 AM plus a possible heavier burst near ~8 AM",
    "Winter Weather Advisory explicitly highlighting hazardous travel for the Fri AM commute (2–4\" + light glaze possible regionally)",
    "Road-clearing reality: highways likely OK, but county/local streets and parking lots may lag; salt can be outpaced by persistent drizzle",
    "No confirmed domino effect yet (no verified neighboring-district closures/delays found), and no significant power-outage signal at this time"
  ],
  "decision_rationale": "Expert agreement is strong that this is NOT a high-snowfall Michigan shutdown, but IS a high-impact commute hazard because of subfreezing temps plus freezing drizzle potential before dawn.\n\nKey conflict: the web verifier flagged a Weather.com snippet showing -25°F wind chill (which would normally force a 90–95% call). I investigated via the meteorologist tool: the trusted bus-window forecast for Rockford is ~29°F with light winds (wind chill ~21–22°F), and achieving -20°F would require near-zero temps and/or much stronger winds. The Weather.com -25°F appears time/place mismatched or stale. Therefore, extreme-cold automatic-closure rules do NOT apply here.\n\nGiven Michigan’s higher closure threshold, the absence of a confirmed neighboring-district closure wave, and only scattered/stable power outages systemwide, a FULL closure is not the most likely outcome. However, the safety and infrastructure assessments both emphasize that freezing drizzle can create invisible glaze on secondary roads right when buses roll, which is exactly when districts choose delays or occasionally cancel if traction reports are bad.\n\nNet: I price this as a borderline, ice-driven decision where a 2-hour delay is more likely than a full closure; but since you asked for a single snow-day probability, I’m setting a moderate 41% chance that Rockford will NOT run a normal on-time schedule (closure most likely only if glazing is widespread at 5:30–6:30 AM or the 8 AM snow burst arrives early/heavier).",
