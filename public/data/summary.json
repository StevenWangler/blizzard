    "Historical patterns for Kent County/Rockford show that similar weekend 6–10\" storms with improving conditions by Sunday night usually lead to school opening on time or with, at most, a short delay.",
    "Safety assessment indicates moderate risk: primary roads rated fair (3/5), secondary and walking conditions more problematic (2/5), consistent with ‘messy but manageable’ rather than widespread shutdown.",
    "Timing of worst conditions (Saturday evening through late Sunday morning) leaves a substantial plow window before the Monday AM commute, barring an unexpectedly intense wrap‑around band persisting through 2–6 AM Monday."

  "decision_rationale": "Using Michigan‑specific closure behavior and the provided expert inputs, an 8–10\" weekend storm with sub‑freezing temps and some fresh late‑night snow pushes risk up but does not typically cross the high‑probability closure threshold here.\n\nMeteorology: Forecast shows roughly 8\"+ of snow overall, with a Winter Storm Watch and some heavy bands, but peak rates near 1\"/hr and winds around 15–20 mph keep conditions below classic blizzard/near‑whiteout standards. Critical for schools, the worst travel appears focused Saturday evening through late Sunday morning. By Sunday afternoon/evening, intensity eases, though another 1–3\" could fall late Sunday night, creating slick roads and fresh cover before bus time.\n\nHistory: For Rockford/Kent County, 6–10\" events concentrated over a weekend, with improving but still wintry conditions by Sunday night, usually do *not* trigger widespread Monday closures. The historical snow‑day rates for similar patterns cluster around 30–50% when some snow lingers into Monday, but closer to 30% when the main storm is done and cleanup time is adequate. Here, the overlap into Monday appears moderate, not extreme.\n\nSafety: The transportation/safety analysis labels overall risk as moderate. Primary roads are expected to be plowed but slick; secondary roads, parking lots, and walking routes are more marginal due to refreeze and compacted snow. That profile aligns with districts opting for normal start or a 2‑hour delay more often than a full closure.\n\nBalancing these, a full snow day is meaningfully possible—especially if a stronger‑than‑forecast band persists toward 3–6 AM Monday or cleanup lags on rural routes—but the base case is that Rockford runs school, perhaps with a delay. To be decisive and avoid an overly neutral 40–60% band, the final probability for a *full‑day* closure is set at 32%, implying roughly a 68% chance of no full snow day (on‑time or delayed start).",
