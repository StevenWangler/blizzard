  "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorology: Warm storm, all rain, temps ~40s–50s°F through the commute, no accumulating snow, no freezing rain during school hours.\n- History: Similar warm January rain systems in Kent County have 1–3% historical closure rates; snow days come from snow/ice/blizzard or extreme cold, none of which apply here.\n- Safety: Roads mainly wet with ponding and some hydroplaning risk; visibility reduced at times; no plow operations needed; morning commute rated moderate impact, afternoon minimal.\n- News/community: No Rockford or neighboring district closure chatter, no official hints of concern, no social media buzz, and no local winter alerts for Kent County.\nAll four lines of evidence agree that: (a) there is no snow/ice event, (b) impacts are primarily heavy rain + wind, and (c) local institutions are treating this as a routine school day.\n\n2. Expert disagreement\nThere is essentially no substantive conflict:\n- Meteorology and history both say \"very low\" closure likelihood.\n- Safety uses the word \"moderate\" for travel risk, but scores roads at 7–8/10 (good) and explicitly states this is not a plow/ice event.\n- News intel finds no neighboring closures or concern.\nThe only mild tension is that \"moderate\" commute risk might sound worse than the meteorological and historical risk, but in context it refers to typical heavy‑rain driving caution, not closure‑level hazard. This does not require tool clarification.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Snowfall: 0\"; plows are effectively not a factor.\n- Worst conditions: 00:00–13:00 on 2026‑01‑09, dominated by rain.\n- School start ~07:40: roads are wet with some heavy rain and puddling but above freezing.\n- Because no accumulation occurs, there is no backlog of plowing or salting needed before buses run; crews only need basic drainage management.\nThus, the plow‑timing question is moot for closure purposes.\n\n4. Ice risk\n- Meteorological analysis: freezing hours = 0 during precipitation; temps are mid‑40s to near 50°F during heaviest rain.\n- Alert summary: icy spots are a concern mainly early Thu on untreated roads, not during the Fri commute.\n- Safety assessment: ice formation risk tagged as \"moderate\" overall, but narrative clarifies any refreeze risk is after mid‑afternoon as temps slide toward the 30s once roads have started drying.\n- Historical analysis: no flash‑freeze signal; marginal cold arrives after precip ends.\nNet: there is no material ice risk during the school window. Late‑day patchy slick spots after school do not justify a full snow day.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News intel explicitly lists neighboring_district_closures: []. No districts around Rockford are reported closed or signalling concern.\n- State-level winter advisories apply to U.P. counties, not Kent County or West Michigan.\nPer the rules, 3+ neighboring closures would add +15–20% to probability; here we have 0, so no upward adjustment.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nMain failure paths:\n- Forecast bust: an unmodeled strong cold surge coincides with ongoing rain, producing a surprise flash freeze and widespread icing right at the morning commute.\n- Infrastructure issues: localized urban flooding, drainage backups, or power outages significant enough to shut down buildings or bus operations.\n- Late-breaking policy decision: district becomes unusually cautious for non‑weather reasons (e.g., transportation staffing, infrastructure vulnerability) and cancels despite conditions being only moderately rainy.\nAll of these are low‑probability based on current data. Meteorology and history indicate no strong cold front timing issue; safety notes only standing‑water concerns; news intel shows no existing outages or infrastructure alarms.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS\nWeights: Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News Intel 20%.\n- Meteorology (35%): With 0\" snow, 0 freezing hours, and rain‑only precip, the raw closure likelihood is in the 0–5% range.\n- Safety (25%): Road, walking, and driving scores (~6–8/10) with moderate, not severe, impacts argue for schools staying open; contributes a modest 5–10% risk window mainly for non‑snow hazards (hydroplaning, visibility). I align this closer to 5% due to lack of severe triggers.\n- History (20%): Historical snow‑day rate for analogous warm rain events is 1–3%; this pulls the estimate toward the low single digits.\n- News intel (20%): No signals of closure, no neighboring districts acting, and 'no_buzz' sentiment all strongly support an operational school day and keep the probability at the floor, with no upward adjustment.\nCombining these, the natural range is about 2–8%. Given the explicit Michigan thresholds (which treat <4\" snow as only 5–15% risk) and the fact we have 0\" snow and no ice, I set the final probability at 5%.\n\nCONFIDENCE AND THRESHOLD CHECK\n- Michigan thresholds: This event is below even the lowest snow‑day threshold (there is literally no snow or ice), so structurally the chance of closure is extremely low.\n- Expert unanimity: All four expert streams independently converge on a routine school day.\n- No neighboring closures and no community buzz remove the main real‑time wildcard.\nTherefore, I assess confidence as high, with the remaining 5% reserved for unexpected operational issues rather than weather forecast error.\n\nFINAL DECISION\nA weather-related snow/ice day for Rockford Public Schools on Friday, Jan. 9, 2026 is very unlikely. Conditions are wet, windy, and at times messy, but they fall well within normal operating parameters for West Michigan in January. A full closure would be an outlier relative to the forecast, historical analogs, and current community signals.",
