  "decision_rationale": "1) EXPERT AGREEMENT / CONFLICTS\n- Meteorologist: Cold, subfreezing, light freezing drizzle possible, essentially 0\" snow, no major ice storm, low risk for full closure.\n- Safety Analyst: Moderate risk; primary roads usable with treatment; some black ice and slick spots; recommends normal operations with cautions and maybe reassess only if new pre‑dawn precip appears.\n- Historian: For similar patterns (very cold, light/freezing drizzle, no big storm), closure rates are ~25–40% at most, usually when wind chills or icing are slightly worse than in this case. Emphasizes that Rockford rarely closes for cold alone unless wind chills are significantly below –15°F during bus hours or ice is more substantial.\n- News/Intel: No district or regional signals of closures or delays, no active advisory for Kent County, no neighboring districts closing, forecast messaging to the public is ‘mostly cloudy, seasonable, no storm’. Community sentiment is basically ‘no buzz’.\n\nAll four point in the same direction: conditions are marginal and manageable, not a clear snow day setup. There are no major conflicts—only nuance about how uncomfortable/patchy-icy the morning might be.\n\n2) WHERE THEY DISAGREE (MINOR)\n- Historian floats a 25–40% closure rate band for patterns that sometimes trend colder/worse than forecast; meteorologist and safety analyst are more conservative, suggesting low closure risk given current data.\n- Safety flags a ‘moderate’ morning risk window 4–9 AM, but still recommends normal operations with precautions rather than closure.\nThese are not incompatible; they reflect that while there is some non‑zero risk, the base case is school open.\n\n3) PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions window from safety: 4:00–9:00 AM (moderate impact on morning commute).\n- There is no significant new accumulating snow; the issue is residual/patchy freezing drizzle and refreeze on cold pavement.\n- Plows/salt crews can (and likely already have) treated main routes overnight. With no heavy new precip, they mainly need to maintain and spot-treat slick areas.\n- Time from the core risk onset (around 4 AM) to a typical RPS first bell ~7:40 AM is about 3.5 hours, and through the end of peak bus window (~9 AM) is 5 hours. Given light QPF and no heavy rates, this is plenty for Kent County crews to keep primaries in workable condition; remaining trouble spots are on secondaries, hills, neighborhoods, and parking lots.\n\n4) ICE RISK\n- There IS ice risk, but not an ice storm: light freezing drizzle and refreeze on already-cold surfaces; meteorologist explicitly notes ‘light glaze/spotty slickness’ rather than widespread, thick accretion.\n- Safety backs this: high ice-formation risk but only moderate impact with proper treatment.\n- Without heavy, ongoing freezing rain during the entire commute or major power/traffic issues, Michigan districts typically stay open, perhaps considering a short delay if surprise icing intensifies.\n\n5) NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel confirms: no closures or delays posted for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD or on major TV closing lists.\n- No winter weather advisory focused on Kent County; alerts are elsewhere in the state.\n- According to the competition rules, that means no upward probability bump from neighboring closures (+15–20%) applies.\n\n6) HOW I WEIGHTED EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Clear signal of low storm magnitude, 0\" snow, light icing only. Strong downward pull on snow‑day odds.\n- Safety Analyst (25%): ‘Moderate’ risk but explicit recommendation for normal operations with extra treatment and caution. Also leans against closure; this reinforces the low probability.\n- Historian (20%): Suggests a 25–40% closure rate for somewhat similar patterns but notes that closures usually require more severe wind chills or more organized icing. Given our less-extreme forecast, I place us near the low edge or below that range.\n- News/Intel (20%, secret weapon): No buzz, no advisories, no neighbor closures, normal calendar posted, TV closing lists empty. This strongly supports the ‘school open’ scenario and pulls probability further down.\n\nCombining these:\n- Start with a historical/meteorological baseline around ~20–25% for a cold/patchy-ice morning without major precip.\n- Safety’s ‘operate with caution’ stance keeps us at or slightly below that, not above.\n- News/community intel sharply discourages a high number; no neighboring closures → no positive adjustment.\n- Michigan threshold guidance in the prompt: with 0\" snow and only light glaze, we’re in the usual ‘5–15%’ bracket for sub‑4\" events, maybe a bit higher due to ice risk but well below major‑storm thresholds.\n\nThat yields an estimated snow‑day probability of about 18%: higher than a perfectly routine dry morning, but still clearly in the ‘school in session’ regime.\n\n7) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG\nThe main ways this prediction could fail are:\n- Forecast bust toward more freezing rain or drizzle right into the 5–8 AM window, producing widespread black ice (especially on rural and secondary roads) that morning observers deem unsafe.\n- Wind chills verifying significantly colder than expected (sustained < -15°F during pickup across much of the district) combined with operational issues (bus starts, heating problems).\n- An unanticipated advisory or wave of nearby closures overnight that shifts administrator risk tolerance at the last minute.\nBecause those are plausible but not currently indicated, the forecast is for school to be open, with an 18% chance of some form of closure (more likely a delay than a full day off).",
