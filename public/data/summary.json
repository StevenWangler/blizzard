  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology: Describes a cold but quiet day—essentially dry during the entire school commute with only a trace/dusting of snow late at night, no accumulation, and no ice. Winds breezy but not enough to cause blowing snow problems. No alerts.\n- History: Past patterns with this setup (cold, overcast, almost no accumulating snow, no storm at bus time) produce closures only about 1–3% of the time in this region. Notes that real closure events typically involve ≥8\" snow, significant ice, or extreme wind chills ≤−15°F—none present here.\n- Safety: Road scores are very strong (9/10 primary and secondary; 8/10 lots). Morning and afternoon commute impacts are both labeled minimal. Recommends normal on‑time start with only routine spot treatment of slick areas.\n- News/Intel: No active advisories for Dec 15 targeting Kent County. Rockford and neighboring districts show no announced closures or delays; calendars show a normal school day. Community chatter is “uncertain,” not hyping a storm or snow day.\n\nAll four are aligned: conditions support a normal school day. There are no substantive conflicts to resolve, so tool-based clarification isn’t needed.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Key fact: There is effectively no new accumulating snow overnight into Monday and 0% snow probability during the morning commute.\n- That means plow timing is dominated by cleanup from earlier systems, which road crews have had ~36–48 hours to address before Monday morning.\n- With no fresh accumulation ending near bus time, the usual “hours from snow end to 7:40 AM” calculation isn’t the limiting factor. Roads are already treated; Monday is a maintenance/spot‑salt day, not an active storm recovery morning.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain/drizzle, and no active precip during the commute.\n- Safety: Flags only a moderate background refreeze risk on existing packed snow/ice and melt areas (e.g., bridges, shaded spots, parking lots). This is addressed through routine salt/abrasives and spot treatment, not a district‑wide safety emergency.\n- No indication of a glaze, widespread black ice event, or ice storm. Under the rubric, lack of a significant ice event keeps us in the low‑probability range.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news intelligence\n- News/Intel finds no pre‑emptive closures or delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD—everyone is planning a normal day.\n- There are no major event cancellations or power issues, and no headline‑level stories warning of dangerous conditions Monday morning in Kent County.\n- Community sentiment is not strongly expecting closure; in Michigan, that typically correlates with business‑as‑usual weather.\n\n5. Applying the Michigan thresholds\n- New snow: essentially 0\" (far under the <4\" category). Threshold guidance says: <4\" → 5–15% in Michigan. This case is actually weaker than a typical light snow event because there’s effectively no accumulation during the commute.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no major advisory, and no 3+ neighboring districts closing, so none of the big upward adjustments apply.\n- Historical analysis explicitly estimates closure odds at only a few percent for analogs.\n\n6. Weighting the four expert domains\nUsing the specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates a normal, dry commute with no hazards that typically trigger closures. This alone pushes the closure probability down toward the single digits.\n- Safety (25%): Road and walking scores are high, commute impacts minimal, explicit recommendation against closure or delay. That supports the low end of the 5–15% band, or even below, because conditions are better than many routine winter mornings.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 1–3%. This anchors the estimate at the very low end and provides strong context that districts in this area rarely close for this setup.\n- News/Intel (20%): Confirms no neighboring district closures, no advisory, no strong community expectation of a snow day. That keeps us from bumping the probability up via social or regional signals.\n\nCombining these, the evidence is uniformly on the side of school being open, with no conflicting signals or hidden risks. To reflect that, I set the snow day probability at 3%: within the “few percent” historical analog, below the standard 5–15% Michigan threshold band because there is virtually no new snow or ice.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 3% estimate could be too low:\n- Forecast bust: A surprise lake‑effect band or clipper develops Sunday night into Monday, dropping several inches (4–8\"+) right up to or through the commute, with poor road treatment time.\n- Unexpected ice: Freezing drizzle or an under‑forecast light rain/drizzle event occurs overnight, producing widespread black ice not seen in current guidance.\n- Extreme cold shift: Wind chills drop to or below about −15°F at bus time due to colder temperatures or stronger winds than forecast, potentially triggering an extreme‑cold closure.\n- Late‑breaking operational issues: Major power outages or serious road‑commission problems that aren’t weather‑severity driven but still force closures.\n\nGiven the current analyses and lack of such signals, those are low‑likelihood scenarios, but they’re the primary failure modes to watch on Sunday night.\n\nBottom line: With strong agreement across meteorology, safety, history, and news intel, and no sign of a disruptive storm, the most accurate Brier‑score‑oriented forecast is that Rockford Public Schools will almost certainly be open on time Monday, with only routine winter precautions needed.",
