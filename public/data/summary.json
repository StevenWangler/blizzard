  "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreements: All experts agree this is NOT a snowfall-driven snow day (near-zero snow). The main risks are (a) extreme cold and (b) patchy icing/black ice on secondary/local roads. Power outages are not currently widespread.\n2) Disagreements: The main conflict is wind chill magnitude (WeatherAPI ~-10 to -19°F vs Weather.com/NWS-referenced reporting ~-25°F) and how long the road hazard persists (not just when precip falls). Tools resolved this: Web verifier confirms Weather.com shows ~-25 to -26°F 5–8 AM; safety clarifies hazard window extends through the morning due to persistent cold.\n3) Plow timing math: This is not about “hours from snow end” because there’s little snow to plow; it’s about whether a thin glaze forms and then persists. Infrastructure + safety indicate main routes should be serviceable by ~6:30 AM, but residential/local streets remain the most variable through ~9 AM, and salt is less effective.\n4) Any ice? Yes—freezing drizzle/freezing rain signal plus high ice-formation risk; even tiny amounts can create unpredictable slick patches.\n5) Neighboring districts? News intel found no confirmed Fri 01/30 closures/delays in nearby districts at the time checked (no +15–20% bump).\n6) Power outage concerns? No evidence of a widespread outage event (very low statewide outages). No adjustment beyond baseline.\n7) Wind chill threshold verification? Yes—Weather.com indicates ≤ -20°F is likely, not marginal, during bus-stop hours; that elevates risk meaningfully.\n8) What would make me wrong? (a) If actual wind chills are closer to WeatherAPI (>-20°F) and roads are largely dry/treated, school likely opens normally → I’d be overestimating closure risk. (b) If even a trace glaze becomes widespread on neighborhood/bus-route roads or Rockford applies a strict cold policy at ≤ -20°F, a delay/closure becomes much more likely → I’d be underestimating.\n\nWeighting per directive: Meteorology (25%) + Safety (25%) drive the core call; history (15%) pulls probability down because trace-precip days usually stay open; news (15%) keeps it from jumping because no neighboring closures are confirmed; infrastructure (10%) supports “serviceable but variable”; power (5%) is neutral; web verifier (5%) pushes up due to wind-chill trigger. Net: I move above the agents’ ~21% average because the wind-chill trigger appears met and the safety window is longer than the initial 00:00–01:00 framing. Still, lack of confirmed neighboring closures and minimal precip keeps it below 50%.\n\nBottom line: higher-than-normal chance of disruption, with delay more likely than full closure; I set full-closure (“snow day”) probability at 38%.",
