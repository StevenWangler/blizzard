    "Rockford Public Schools is confirmed CLOSED for Mid Winter Break on Fri Feb 13, 2026 (scheduled, not weather-driven) per district homepage, calendar, and superintendent update",
    "No accumulating snow/precipitation expected; no ice storm/freezing rain signal—main hazard is patchy black ice from freezing fog/mist and localized near-zero visibility 3–9 AM",
    "Wind chill is NOT at automatic-closure thresholds (no credible ≤ -20°F signal for 6–8 AM); cross-source web data appears stale/mismatched by date",
    "Road-clearing capacity is not a limiting factor (roads generally clear); any issues would be localized (bridges/valleys/untreated surfaces)",
    "Power outages are localized (~0.71% in Kent County; no confirmed RPS facility outages), so outages are not a primary closure driver"

  "decision_rationale": "There is no weather-driven ‘snow day decision’ to be made for Rockford Public Schools on Fri Feb 13, 2026 because the district is already scheduled closed for Mid Winter Break (confirmed across multiple official district channels). If you’re instead asking whether weather conditions *would have justified* a closure *if school were in session*, the meteorology/infrastructure picture is still low-end: no falling precipitation or accumulation is expected, winds are light, and the main risk is a freezing-fog/black-ice window roughly 3–9 AM. Safety impact is real but typically managed in West Michigan via targeted salting/route checks and, at most, a 2-hour delay—full-day closures are uncommon without widespread ice accretion, heavy snow, or extreme wind chills. Power outages are present but localized (Kent County ~0.71% out) with no confirmed school-facility outages, so they do not materially raise a closure probability.",
