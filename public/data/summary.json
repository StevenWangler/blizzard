  "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement checklist:\n- Meteorologist: Cold, quiet day with 0\" snow, no rain, no ice storm signal, moderate winds, and only patchy freezing fog. Explicitly states snow-day probability is effectively 0% from weather alone.\n- Historian: Multiple high-confidence analogs (near-freezing temps, no precip, modest winds, some fog) all have 0% historical snow-day rate in this region. Notes Michigan closures usually require 6–10\"+ snow, significant ice, blizzard, or extreme cold—none present.\n- Safety analyst: Roads scored very good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 7/10). Morning commute risk rated \"moderate\" only due to possible thin glaze from freezing fog 5–8 AM; afternoon minimal. Recommends normal operations with targeted salting and driver caution.\n- News intelligence: Rockford Public Schools are already closed for winter break Dec 22–Jan 2, and Dec 25 is Christmas Day. Neighboring districts also closed for normal holiday/break, not for weather. No snow-day style alerts, no hazardous-travel headlines for Thursday; main concern is potential freezing rain later Thursday night into Friday.\nAll four agree: (a) weather on Dec 25 is non-eventful for Michigan standards, (b) there is no significant snow or ice hazard during normal school hours, and (c) there is no active snow-day decision because schools are on scheduled break.\n\n2. Expert disagreements:\n- The only slight tension is that the safety analyst labels overall risk \"moderate\" due to localized black ice risk from freezing fog, while meteorology/historical context treat closure risk as essentially zero. This is not a true conflict: the safety team is flagging *operational caution* (micro-scale slick spots) rather than advocating for closure.\n- No conflicts appear about precipitation type, timing, or the presence of a larger storm—everyone confirms dry, near-freezing, with only patchy fog.\nGiven these are complementary perspectives rather than contradictions, no tool clarification is needed.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- There is no accumulating snow, and no measurable precip is forecast during the night or morning. Therefore, plow timing in the usual sense (clearing inches of snow before the 7:40 AM bell) is irrelevant.\n- The only treatment need is potential spot salting for thin glaze from freezing fog between about 5:00–8:00 AM.\n- With no snow to clear and a narrow window of localized icing, the effective \"treatment window\" is several hours *before* any hypothetical arrival time, and standard overnight/morning maintenance is more than sufficient. From a Michigan operations standpoint, this strongly supports staying open under normal conditions.\n\n4. Ice considerations:\n- There is *no* signal of organized freezing rain or widespread glaze on Thursday daytime.\n- Modeled hazard is limited to localized black ice from freezing fog in the 5–7/8 AM window, with good visibility (~6 miles) and surface temps hovering at or just above 32°F.\n- Safety and meteorology both characterize this as minor/patchy and addressable with salting, not a systemic ice event. This does *not* reach the \"ice changes everything\" threshold used in Michigan for closures (i.e., a true ice storm or widespread freezing rain event).\n\n5. Neighboring district status:\n- News intelligence explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD.\n- All are in standard winter/Christmas break around Dec 25; any closures are calendar/holiday-based, not storm-driven snow days.\n- There is no wave of weather-triggered closures to justify a +15–20% bump from neighboring districts. The Michigan threshold rule explicitly cares about *weather-driven* same-day decisions; that does not apply here.\n\n6. What would make this forecast wrong?\n- A surprise, unmodeled freezing rain or drizzle episode during the early morning could create more widespread ice than expected. However, both the meteorological and news data emphasize that the more significant freezing-rain threat is later Thursday night into Friday, not during the Thursday morning window.\n- A rapidly developing lake-effect band is theoretically possible in West Michigan, but the described synoptic setup (stable overcast, easterly/northerly flow, no lake-effect signal) argues strongly against this.\n- Large-scale model or NWS forecast changes overnight could upgrade Thursday morning hazards, but nothing in the inputs hints at that; all current guidance is aligned.\nGiven the uniformity of the evidence and the quiet pattern, the probability that Thursday *daytime* in Rockford suddenly becomes a closure‑level event is extremely small.\n\nWeighting of experts:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates a quiet, dry day. Baseline snow-day probability from this alone is ~0%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Notes only localized, manageable black-ice risk and supports normal operations. This nudges the probability very slightly above absolute zero to account for tail risks, but still well under 5%.\n- History (20% weight): Analog days in this region under similar conditions have 0% closure rate. This reinforces anchoring the forecast close to 0%.\n- News intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon): Confirms that (a) schools are already on winter break and (b) no weather-driven alerts or community concern exist for Thursday. Since there is literally no school session to cancel, the *operational* snow-day probability (a weather-caused closure decision) is effectively 0%.\n\nMichigan thresholds application:\n- Snow total: 0\" → under the Michigan guideline, this is well below even the 5–15% range associated with <4\" events, especially with no ice storm.\n- No substantial ice, no blizzard, no extreme cold → all high-threshold Michigan closure triggers are absent.\n- No neighboring *weather*-driven closures → no positive adjustment.\n\nFinal determination:\nBecause Rockford Public Schools are already closed for winter break and weather conditions are benign by Michigan winter standards, the chance of a *weather-caused* snow day decision for Thursday, Dec 25, 2025, is effectively 0%. I assign 0% rather than a small positive number to align with the operational reality that there is no school session to cancel and all four expert domains concur on the absence of a closure-level event.",
