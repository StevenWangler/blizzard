  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Forecast shows a quiet, cold period leading into Monday 1/12. Total new snowfall: 0.0\" Sunday and overnight. Snow probabilities during overnight and morning commute: 5%. Temps stay below freezing but near 30°F with wind chills in the teens. No active winter alerts for the Sunday night–Monday morning window. Overall message: routine winter cold, dry roads, very low closure risk.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road conditions are rated very good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10). Only moderate, localized refreeze risk on untreated/shaded surfaces, bridges, and rural stretches. Morning and afternoon commute impacts are both labeled minimal. Explicit statement: normal school operations are appropriate; a snow day is not warranted.\n- History (20% weight): Past cases with essentially the same setup (minor snow more than 24 hours prior, then a cold but dry day and night) show snow day rates of ~1–3%. This is fully consistent with Michigan norms where such conditions are standard open-school days. The historical assessment explicitly characterizes the closure probability as “a few percent at most.”\n- News/Community Intel (20% weight): No RPS or neighboring district closures announced for Jan 12. The district calendar lists Jan 19 as the next no‑school day; there is no weather alert banner. No regional news highlighting a high‑impact storm focused on Kent County for that morning. Community sentiment is not strongly pushing for closure; coverage treats this as routine January weather.\n\nConsensus: All four domains independently point to a normal school day and a very low probability of closure. There are no substantive conflicts between experts.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR RED FLAGS\n- The only slight tension is that the safety assessment flags a \"moderate\" ice formation risk in the abstract, but then rates actual driving/walking conditions as good and commute impacts as minimal. This is not a true conflict: it reflects awareness of isolated slick spots, not systemic hazardous ice.\n- Visibility analysis includes some model hours with low visibility, but meteorology explicitly attributes this to low clouds/model noise, not active snow or dense freezing fog.\nNo contradictions rise to a level that would materially increase closure odds.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Last light/moderate snow: Saturday, Jan 10, with only ~1–2 cm (~0.5–0.8\") total.\n- Sunday, Jan 11: cold, breezy, and dry all day and night. No new precipitation.\n- That gives road crews essentially 24–36+ hours of dry, subfreezing time between the end of the Saturday event and the Monday 7:40 AM school start to fully plow and salt.\n- With primary roads already rated 9/10 and secondary 8/10, this timing is more than adequate for a Michigan county with strong winter operations.\n- Effective hours from last meaningful precip to first school bell: well over 24 hours, far exceeding what is typically needed even after a larger storm.\n\n4. ICE ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL)\n- Temperatures: Below freezing but steady; no thaw–refreeze cycling due to sun/warmth.\n- Precipitation: Meteorology shows essentially 0% chance of freezing rain or drizzle; total QPF near zero.\n- Safety notes “moderate” ice risk only in the sense of localized refreeze on untreated spots. There is no indication of a glaze or widespread black ice event.\n- News intel: No freezing rain or ice storm advisories for Kent County or Rockford for Jan 12; recent ice concerns were targeted to earlier dates and different areas.\nConclusion: There is *no* evidence of a district‑wide ice event. Only typical patchy slick spots for mid‑January Michigan. Therefore this does not trigger the higher (60–85%+) closure regime reserved for ice/glaze events.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICT STATUS\n- News intel explicitly reports no confirmed closures or special plans for Monday, Jan 12, 2026 from Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD as of Jan 9.\n- No regional closure lists or articles are flagging West Michigan school systems for that date.\nThus: 0 neighboring confirmed closures → no positive adjustment to closure probability.\n\n6. HOW I WEIGHTED THE EXPERTS\nStarting from a baseline informed by Michigan thresholds:\n- New snow: 0\" → baseline closure band ~5–15% becomes more like 0–5% for this region because there’s *no* active precip.\n- No ice storm / blizzard / extreme cold indicators.\n\nApplying weighted expertise:\n- Meteorology (35%): Very clear, high‑confidence quiet forecast. This strongly pulls the estimate toward the low end (≈2–4%).\n- Safety (25%): High road scores, minimal commute impact. This reinforces a low value and reduces the upper tail; settles in ≈2–5%.\n- History (20%): Nearly identical patterns historically yield ≈1–3% closure rate. This nudges the estimate slightly lower within the 0–5% band.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures announced, no buzz, no advisory banners, no domino effect from neighbors. This confirms we should not add any of the +10–20% adjustments prescribed when neighbors close or the community expects closure. It also pushes us away from assuming any hidden admin concern.\n\nCombining these, a value around **3%** best matches all evidence and respects the historical 1–3% base rate while allowing a small margin for unforeseen last‑minute changes (e.g., an unmodeled lake‑effect band or surprise slick‑spot cluster).\n\n7. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nKey ways this 3% could be an under‑ or over‑estimate:\n- Underestimate risk (actual closure higher than predicted) if:\n  • A last‑minute, poorly modeled shortwave or lake‑effect band develops Sunday night, dumping several inches of snow between ~2–7 AM with rapid accumulation.\n  • An unexpected freezing drizzle episode occurs pre‑dawn, creating widespread black ice and forcing district buses to halt.\n  • A new advisory (Winter Weather Advisory / Ice Storm Warning) is issued specifically for Kent County targeting the Monday AM commute.\n  • A serious non‑weather infrastructure failure (major power outages, heating issues) coincidentally occurs.\n- Overestimate risk (true closure probability even lower than 3%) if:\n  • Roads dry out even more than expected due to wind and effective salting, leading to essentially bare‑and‑dry pavement everywhere.\n  • Temperatures stay slightly warmer (near or just above freezing) eliminating most refreeze concerns.\n\nGiven the current data, these failure modes are possible but not likely, justifying a small but nonzero probability rather than 0%.\n\n8. FINAL DECISION\nAll four expert streams are aligned: conditions are routine for Rockford, MI in mid‑January, with no active snow, no ice storm, no extreme cold, and good road treatment time. Historical precedent, real‑time intel, and safety metrics all support a normal school day. Therefore, I set the snow day probability at **3%** with **high** confidence, well outside the discouraged 40–60% range and optimized for a strong Brier score against a very likely ‘schools open’ outcome.",
