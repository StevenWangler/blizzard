  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: Only about 0.5\" of new snow with the main burst Tuesday evening into shortly after midnight. By 4–7 AM Wednesday, no active accumulating snow, just cold, breezy, overcast.\n- Safety: Worst travel conditions 10 PM–2 AM. By 6–8 AM, primary and secondary roads are expected to be mostly clear with typical winter slick spots. Morning and afternoon commute impacts rated minimal.\n- History: Comparable past patterns in the Rockford/Grand Rapids area—post‑event flurries, mid‑20s temps, winds 10–20 mph—produce very low snow‑day rates (~3–8%). Michigan districts typically stay open unless there is heavy snow, serious ice, or extreme cold.\n- News/Intel: Confirms that Rockford Public Schools and most neighboring districts are on Winter Break with no classes Dec 31; there is no planned academic day to cancel. NWS messaging highlights hazardous travel mainly earlier in the week and through Tuesday/early Wednesday, but not a targeted school‑day snow‑day scenario for Rockford.\n\nAll four agree this is a routine cold winter day *for a school day*, and in reality Dec 31 is already a non‑school day.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS / TENSIONS\n- Meteorological & safety detail vs. some broader media headlines: NWS‑based articles talk about hazardous travel and strong winds continuing into Wednesday, but the localized forecast and safety analysis for Rockford’s specific morning window show improving conditions, modest winds (10–17 mph rather than sustained 50 mph), and light/no new snow.\n- This is resolved by weighting the targeted, hour‑by‑hour local forecast and the safety analyst more heavily than generalized regional headlines.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions: 2025‑12‑30T22:00 to 2025‑12‑31T02:00.\n- Typical first‑bell / bus window: around 7:40 AM start, buses 6:00–7:40 AM.\n- Time between worst conditions ending (02:00) and first bell (07:40): about 5.5 hours.\n- That window is ample for Kent County and city crews, especially with only ~0.5\" of new snow and no ongoing heavy precip. This strongly favors normal operations over closure.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Safety analyst flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\" from prior mixed precip, mainly on bridges, overpasses, and untreated side streets.\n- However, there is **no active freezing rain** in the pre‑school window, temperatures stay in the 20s (not going above and back below freezing multiple times), and crews can salt overnight.\n- This is not a classic ice‑storm setup; elevated but manageable slickness, not district‑wide paralyzing ice.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News/Intel: Neighboring districts and Kent ISD programs largely share holiday schedules; no Dec 31 weather‑driven snow‑day announcements are posted as of the afternoon of Dec 30.\n- Because most are already on break, we cannot get the usual ‘domino effect’ of 3+ neighbors closing for weather. There is therefore no +15–20% upward adjustment from regional closures.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Forecast bust where:\n  - Snow continues into the early morning with much higher rates than 0.5\" total, e.g., a surprise 4–6\" band peaking 3–7 AM.\n  - Unforeseen significant icing occurs overnight (e.g., more freezing rain than modeled), turning secondary roads and hills into sheet ice by morning.\n  - Winds verify much stronger locally (frequent 40–50 mph gusts) creating true whiteout conditions and large drifts at bus‑time.\n- Given the consistency between meteorology, safety, and history, and lack of strong signals of these extremes, these failure modes are low‑probability but worth monitoring.\n\n7. PROBABILITY CALCULATION & WEIGHTING\nBase on Michigan thresholds:\n- Expected new snow <1\" with no accumulation during school hours → in the 5–15% range.\n- No blizzard, no major ice, and no extreme cold → stays near the low end of closure risk.\n\nWeighting experts:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates a routine cold day post‑event; this alone suggests ~5–10% snow‑day risk.\n- Safety (25%): Rates morning impact as minimal and roads mostly clear by commute; consistent with ~5–10% closure likelihood.\n- History (20%): Analog days show ~3–8% closure; I take ~6% from this input.\n- News/Intel (20%): Secret‑weapon factor. Confirms Winter Break (no scheduled school) and no neighbor weather closures yet. Community sentiment is \"uncertain\" but not strongly pushing for closure. Since there is no operational school day, practical ‘snow day’ decision probability effectively rounds near zero, but to stay in the framework of “if school *were* in session under these conditions,” it supports a low single‑digit to low‑teens percentage.\n\nCombining these and aligning to the Michigan guideline band for <4\" events, I set the final **snow day probability at 8%** with **high confidence**. That keeps us out of the 40–60% no‑man’s land, is consistent with historical data, and acknowledges a small residual risk if conditions end up worse than forecast.\n\n8. SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT THIS DATE\n- Rockford Public Schools: On Winter Break through Jan 4; there is **no actual snow‑day call** to be made for Dec 31.\n- This prediction should be interpreted as: if Dec 31 were a normal school day under these forecast conditions, the chance of an official weather closure would be about 8%, and the more realistic operational question would be minor delays or just normal school with caution—not a full closure.",
