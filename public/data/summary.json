  "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist, Historian, Safety Analyst, and News Intel (via cross-check) all agree on the core setup:\n  • No accumulating snow overnight into Tuesday (0.0\" forecast, 0% snow probability).\n  • No modeled freezing rain or measurable new ice; any hazard is from freezing fog/black ice, not a glaze or storm.\n  • Temps steady around 31–33°F with mid‑20s°F wind chills – far from Michigan’s extreme‑cold closure thresholds.\n  • Dense/freezing fog overnight with worst vis 12–6 AM, then significant improvement by the main bus/commute window (7–9 AM).\n  • Main roads are expected to be treatable and mostly wet with isolated slick spots by school time; rural/low‑spot pockets remain the key caution.\n  • All explicitly state this pattern does NOT justify a full snow day in typical West Michigan practice; at most, extra caution or perhaps localized delays in an extreme fog pocket case.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\n- The only apparent “disagreement” is tonal:\n  • Meteorologist & Historian frame overall snow‑day risk as LOW.\n  • Safety Analyst labels operational risk as MODERATE, but still concludes a full snow day is not warranted.\n  • News Intel highlights a regional school‑closing outlook indicating some risk in West Michigan, but clarifies that Rockford’s specific signals are weak (no closures announced, mixed sentiment, no major outages/road emergencies).\n- After cross‑check, this isn’t a true conflict: safety’s “moderate” is about localized black‑ice and fog hazards for drivers/walkers, not about district‑wide closure likelihood.\n\n3. PLOW/TREATMENT TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions (freezing fog + patchy black ice) are from ~00:00–06:00/07:00.\n- Main bus/traffic window is ~07:00–08:00.\n- Safety analyst: crews will be in monitoring/treatment mode, not plowing. They can focus salting known slick spots roughly 03:00–06:00.\n- By 06:00–07:00, major corridors (US‑131, arterials into Rockford) should be treated and mainly damp, with localized patches still slick.\n- That implies essentially 1–4 hours of treatment lead time before the bulk of school traffic, which is ample when there’s no new falling precip.\n- For lots: district/contractor crews can spot‑treat campus areas on a similar 03:00–06:00 schedule.\n- Net: Plow/treatment timing is favorable; there’s no “still storming at 7:30 AM” scenario to overwhelm operations.\n\n4. ICE RISK – DOES IT CHANGE THE GAME?\n- There is NO modeled freezing rain or measurable new ice accretion for Jan 6 itself.\n- Ice risk is limited to:\n  • Moisture from dense freezing fog depositing on surfaces near 31–32°F.\n  • Patchy black ice on untreated surfaces, bridges, low‑lying rural stretches, and some parking lots.\n- Michigan closure thresholds treat *significant ice storms* (widespread glaze, trees/lines down, travel emergencies) as a high‑probability closure trigger; this is not that.\n- With temps marginal and salt effective near 31–32°F, and with no active precip during the commute window, this kind of patchy fog‑driven ice historically leads to: normal school with extra caution, not blanket closures.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS – DOMINO EFFECT CHECK\n- News Intel confirms:\n  • As of the evening of Jan 5, there are NO posted closures or delays for Jan 6 for Rockford or any listed neighboring districts (Cedar Springs, Sparta, Kent City, Forest Hills, Northview, Greenville, Lowell, Kenowa Hills, Grand Rapids, Kent ISD).\n  • No large event cancellations, no emergency declarations, no power‑outage clusters.\n- Community chatter is mixed: some hoping for a snow day, others openly expecting a routine winter commute. No strong, confident “everyone thinks we’re closing” signal.\n- Therefore: no +15–20% bump from neighboring closures; no +10–15% bump from overwhelming community expectation of closure.\n\n6. HOW I WEIGHTED EACH EXPERT (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Raw forecast is very clear: 0\" snow, no ice storm, marginal temps, improving vis by bus time.\n  • This strongly pulls the base probability into the 5–15% Michigan “routine weather” band.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Flags moderate *operational* risk from fog/black ice but explicitly states that a full snow day is not justified.\n  • Suggests careful driving, possible micro‑delays, but still normal operations – this keeps probability low but not zero.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Analog patterns (fog + near‑freezing, no new snow/ice, no alerts) show roughly 5–10% historical snow‑day rates.\n  • Seasonal context: districts usually need 6–10\" snow, major ice, or extreme cold to close in early January; none apply.\n  • This firmly reinforces a sub‑15% probability.\n- News Intel (20% weight, “secret weapon”):\n  • No neighboring district closures → no upward adjustment.\n  • Sentiment is uncertain and mixed, not “this is a sure closure” or “this is nothing.” That might argue for a mild nudge above the absolute floor, but not much.\n  • A regional paywalled outlook mentions some risk along/north of I‑96; however, site‑specific data for Rockford + lack of real‑world closure signals makes that a weak up‑adjustment.\n\n7. BASELINE VS. ADJUSTED PROBABILITY\n- Start from Michigan threshold guidance:\n  • 0\" snow, no significant ice ⇒ baseline near low end of <4\" band: about 5–10%.\n- Historical analog rate: 5–10% ⇒ consistent with that baseline.\n- Safety’s “moderate” local hazard (fog/black ice) but clear “don’t cancel” guidance:\n  • Justifies being slightly above the absolute minimum, not at 1–2%.\n- News/community:\n  • No closures posted; community not strongly expecting a day off.\n  • Regional outlook hints at SOME risk; this might nudge from 8% toward ~10%.\n- I avoid the 40–60% band per instructions; the evidence simply doesn’t support high uncertainty or balanced odds.\n\nPutting all that together, I land at **10%**: low but not negligible, consistent with historical closure rates for this specific pattern.\n\n8. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Outcomes that could push the real-world decision *toward closure* and make 10% too low:\n  • Freezing fog and low‑level moisture produce far more widespread ice than modeled – many roads and lots glaze over, and even treated surfaces stay slick.\n  • Visibilities stay <1/4 mile through 7–8 AM district‑wide (not just in pockets), making safe bus operations very difficult.\n  • An unforecast band of light freezing drizzle materializes during the 4–7 AM window, adding real ice accretion on top of fog.\n  • Road commissions fall behind (staffing/equipment issues or resource misallocation), so key corridors and campus lots remain untreated by bus time.\n  • A late‑night NWS Dense Fog Advisory with widespread sub‑1/8‑mile vis triggers a conservative call by multiple superintendents, causing a regional wave of closures.\n- Outcomes that would make 10% *too high*:\n  • Fog dissipates faster than expected; by 5–6 AM vis already several miles and roads largely just wet.\n  • Road reports and early driver checks (5–6 AM) come back clean with minimal slick spots.\n\nGiven current data and Michigan norms, the balance of probabilities still favors **school in session with normal start**.\n",
