      "Primary roads (M-44/US-131 corridors and other trunklines): should be in good shape by the 6:30–8:00 AM bus window given no accumulating precip—expect mostly dry-to-salty pavement with isolated icy patches on bridges/overpasses. Drive time risk is mainly at intersections/ramps.",
      "Secondary and rural/residential roads: a bit more variable—if there’s any residual slush from Tue evening snow showers, it will stay frozen (teens/20s wind chills). Expect some compacted snow/ice in shaded curves, stop-sign approaches, and on lower-volume roads that were plowed later.",
      "Visibility: forecast is generally okay, but the overnight/morning hours show pockets of reduced vis (down to ~1 mile at times). With no precip expected, that reads like low cloud/fog/haze—flag this for bus drivers on darker rural stretches and near open fields.",
      "Wind: W/WNW winds 15–18 mph (gusts ~20–25+ early) can create localized drifting IF there’s loose snow available from Tuesday night. Not a classic blizzard setup, but enough to “polish” icy spots and reduce control on exposed east–west roads.",
      "Cold exposure: wind chills roughly in the +10°F to +20°F range during the morning commute. That’s uncomfortable but nowhere near the Michigan ‘extreme cold’ automatic-closure thresholds (≤ -20°F wind chill).",
      "Operational call: if the district did get a quick 0.5–1.5 inches Tue night (your current obs show patchy light snow around 10:45 PM Tue 2026-02-24), a NORMAL Michigan response is to run on time with maybe a bit of extra caution and potentially minor route slowdowns—not a full closure.",
      "High-value morning checks (5:00–6:00 AM): have drivers/admin do a quick spot-check of (1) bridges/overpasses, (2) north-facing hills, (3) untreated subdivision entrances, and (4) school parking lots/bus loop for glare ice. If those are slick, treat lots/sidewalks immediately rather than considering closure.",
      "If you need a trigger for escalation: the only thing that would push this toward a delay/closure would be widespread black ice (not just isolated) OR unreported heavier Tue-night snow leaving many side roads snow-covered at 6–7 AM. The provided forecast alone does not support that."

Given the limited indicated snow amounts and the region’s typical treatment capacity, that scenario is plausible but not the most likely outcome—so I keep snow-day odds in the single digits.

        "shiftReason": "Meteorologically, Wednesday 2026-02-25 in Rockford, MI looks like a cold but quiet winter day: overcast, breezy, and dry, with no forecast accumulation. That strongly favors school being open. The only credible weather-driven pathway to a closure/delay is indirect—leftover slick spots from Tuesday evening’s snow showers (noted in current conditions on Tue 2/24 ~10:45 PM as “patchy light snow,” and ~1.4 cm indicated around 8 PM in the Tue hourly) refreezing overnight while temperatures remain in the 20s. That can create localized black ice on untreated subdivision streets and bridges, but absent new precip during the 5–9 AM decision window it usually leads to caution/spot treatment rather than a district-wide closure. Hence a low single-digit snow-day probability, not zero."

With no forecast accumulation on Wed 2/25 and wind chills in the ‘uncomfortable but typical’ range, the closure base rate stays low. I’m holding a small tail risk for widespread morning black ice (especially on rural/secondary roads, bridges, and shaded neighborhoods) that could surprise administrators—more likely yielding a 2-hour delay than a full cancellation. Net: low single-digit-to-low-teens; I land at 7% for a full snow day."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/operations perspective, Wednesday 2026-02-25 looks like an “open but cautious” day: dry weather and manageable winds mean conditions should generally *improve* overnight rather than deteriorate. The main closure-capable hazard would be *widespread* black ice on untreated roads/parking lots during 5–9 AM due to refreeze after Tue night snow showers. Given the limited indicated snow amounts and the region’s typical treatment capacity, that scenario is plausible but not the most likely outcome—so I keep snow-day odds in the single digits. A 2-hour delay is more plausible than a full closure if morning spot-checks find lots of glare ice, but the question here is snow day/closure probability, which remains low."

With a dry forecast and no alerting, the default outcome is school open (likely normal start, early dismissal as planned). I still assign a small non-zero probability (6%) because Rockford/Kent County can see localized morning black ice after evening snow showers, and because the web verifier notes a cross-source temperature/wind mismatch that increases uncertainty about morning conditions. But there’s no concrete news trigger suggesting a closure is developing."
