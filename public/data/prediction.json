Temperatures stay in the teens to mid‑20s °F all day, with wind chills near or just above 0°F at times due to SW–W winds gusting into the upper teens mph. Importantly for school operations, there is no precipitation in the forecast from midnight through the end of the day: total QPF and snowfall are both 0, and hourly probabilities of snow or rain are 0% throughout the overnight and morning bus window (roughly 4–9 AM). Roads will be dry aside from any residual slick spots from prior light freezing rain/snow on Sunday, but with no new accumulation, no ice storm, and no active snow during the commute. Visibility is occasionally reduced to about 1 mile in low clouds/stratus overnight but improves to around 4–6 miles by the morning commute and remains adequate through the day. Winds and wind chills are somewhat harsh but not near advisory criteria. There are no weather alerts in effect. Overall, these conditions do not meet typical Michigan thresholds for a snow day.

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast for Monday, 2025-12-15 in Rockford, Michigan, historical analogs strongly suggest **a very low likelihood of a snow day closure**.\n\nKey points relative to Michigan closure triggers:\n- **Snow/Ice Amounts:** Forecast snow for Monday is 0 cm with 0 mm of new precip. There is no indication of accumulating snow, heavy lake‑effect, or a freezing rain event during the school day. Michigan districts rarely close for residual slickness when skies are dry and road crews have had time to work.\n- **Blizzard/Visibility:** Winds peak near 15–18 mph with gusts into the low 20s mph, but without falling snow. This is breezy, not blizzard‑like, and visibility remains good (generally 10 km / 6 miles during commute hours).\n- **Extreme Cold:** Morning air temps around 18–20°F with wind chills in the low single digits to around +5°F are **well above** the common West Michigan extreme‑cold closure thresholds (around -15°F wind chill or colder). The prior day’s early‑morning conditions were closer to that threshold, yet even those are borderline rather than an automatic closure.\n- **Timing:** No new snow or ice is expected in the overnight hours leading into the Monday morning commute (roughly 5–8 AM) or during the afternoon bus runs (2–5 PM). Historically, Rockford and similar districts mainly consider closures when hazardous conditions *are actively developing* during those windows.\n\nBased on historical patterns for mid‑December in Rockford/Grand Rapids and the specific forecast details, the conditions on Monday match a very common “cold, cloudy, dry winter school day” profile. The inferred historical snow‑day rate for this setup is on the order of only a few percent, primarily tied to rare cases where lingering ice from the prior day proves worse than expected on rural back roads. Overall confidence that **schools operate on a normal schedule** on 2025-12-15 is high."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, breezy; 0% snow or freezing rain overnight and through the school day; no alerts.\n- Historian: This setup matches a very common “cold, cloudy, dry school day” with only a few-percent historical closure rate.\n- Safety analyst: Roads generally good (8–9/10), minor refreeze risk only on untreated/ shaded spots; normal operations recommended.\n- News intel: No closure chatter, no advisories for Kent County, no neighboring districts calling off school, Rockford’s own site lists a normal day.\nAll four independently support school being open.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There are no material conflicts. All sources converge on: no new precip, manageable cold, treated roads, and no institutional signals of closure.\n- The only slight nuance is the safety analyst flagging “moderate” ice-formation risk in isolated areas vs. meteorology emphasizing no new precip; these are compatible (residual slick spots from the prior event, not a new storm).\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- The meteorological analysis shows **0% precip** and **0\" snowfall** from midnight through the entire day Monday.\n- The preceding light snow/freezing drizzle occurred on Sunday, giving road crews **overnight and early-morning hours** to finish treatment.\n- By the key start-of-school window (~7:40 AM), road operations will have had **many hours (most of the night)** with no new accumulation.\n- Effectively, plow/salt timing is more than sufficient; we are dealing with cleanup and refreeze, not active snowfall.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- No new freezing rain is forecast; temps are below freezing, so **refreeze is possible**, but:\n  - Safety: Primary roads score 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8.5/10.\n  - Ice risk categorized as **moderate**, localized to untreated spots, bridges, shaded areas, and some sidewalks.\n- This is typical post-event winter driving in Michigan, not a systemic ice storm. There is no indication of widespread glazing that would trigger countywide closures.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, Grand Rapids Public Schools:\n  - **No pre-announced closures or delays** for Monday.\n  - FOX 17 closings page: **zero active school closings or delays** in West Michigan.\n- This strongly indicates a normal-operation expectation across the region. Under the competition rules, no +15–20% adjustment is applied because 3+ neighboring districts are NOT closed.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\nMain ways this prediction could fail:\n- An unexpected overnight freezing drizzle or black ice event far worse than current guidance, producing widespread, invisible ice on rural routes.\n- A late, unforecast band of lake-effect snow setting up directly over Kent County with several inches falling during the 4–7 AM window.\n- A surprise wind-chill or infrastructure issue (e.g., major power outages) not indicated in current data.\nAll of these require **substantial last-minute forecast changes** or emergent hazards; none are supported by the present analyses.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  - Key findings: 0% precip, 0\" snow, cold but not extreme, no alerts.\n  - This alone implies a very low closure probability, on the order of a few percent.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  - Low risk; roads 8–9/10; explicitly states a snow day or delay is **not warranted**.\n  - Supports a similarly low probability.\n- History (20% weight):\n  - Analog patterns show **2–5%** closure rates for this setup, with high confidence.\n- News intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon):\n  - No closures listed anywhere; Rockford’s own site shows a normal school day; no advisory for Kent County; no social-media or news buzz.\n  - This strongly reinforces the low end of the range, with **no positive adjustment** (no neighboring closures, no community expectation of a snow day).\n\nSYNTHESIS AND NUMERICAL DECISION\n- Base Michigan threshold guidance: With **<4\" of new snow** (here, actually 0\"), the generic range is **5–15%**.\n- Our situation is even more benign than a typical light-snow scenario: no precip at all, just residual slick spots.\n- Historical analogs: ~2–5%.\n- Safety and news both argue **against** closure.\n- There are no offsetting factors like extreme cold, blizzard conditions, or systemic ice.\n\nCombining these with the specified weights and aiming for a decisive forecast with good Brier performance, I set the **final snow day probability at 3%**. This reflects a realistic but very small chance that unforecast icing or a surprise band leads to an early-morning closure decision, while aligning tightly with all available evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n- Conditions for Monday, Dec. 15, 2025 in Rockford, MI strongly favor **normal school operations**.\n- Probability of a snow day: **3%**.\n- Confidence: **very high**, because all four expert domains independently converge on the same outcome with no substantive conflicts.",
