Temperatures remain in the 20s all day with wind chills around 5–15°F and no mixed precip or ice; roads should be frozen, not refreezing from above-freezing temps. After Monday’s winter storm, Tuesday morning (midnight–8 AM) is dry but cold and breezy with NW winds 15–20 mph and wind chills near or just below 0°F. Skies are mostly cloudy, but visibility is generally 6+ miles and no new snow is falling during the typical bus window (6–9 AM). Afternoon stays cold and breezy with clouds and no accumulating snow. New snow and blowing snow pick back up mainly after about 6 PM, with patchy moderate snow and localized whiteout conditions in the evening and overnight. Total new accumulation on Tuesday is under 1 inch, far below the 4–6\" that Michigan schools routinely handle, and the main storm impacts and NWS headlines are focused on Monday 12/29, not Tuesday. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for snow and the lack of Tuesday-morning heavy snow or ice, this forecast supports a normal school day on Tuesday: low likelihood of a full snow day, with only a modest chance of localized slick spots or drifting from Monday’s leftovers but not enough for widespread closure."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast for Tuesday, 2025‑12‑30, historical behavior in Kent County, and Michigan closure norms, this pattern most closely matches a post‑storm cold, breezy, comparatively quiet day rather than a primary storm day. Temperatures in the low 20s°F with wind chills around -10°F to -15°F, light additional snow (~1 cm total on Tuesday), and winds generally under 30 mph are within the range that schools in this region regularly operate. The main heavy snow, ice, and 50–60 mph wind gusts occur on Monday, not Tuesday, and advisory/warning products are focused on that earlier period. Historically, Rockford and neighboring districts rarely cancel for these Tuesday‑type conditions alone unless combined with significant unresolved issues from the prior day (e.g., widespread power outages or badly drifted rural roads). Therefore, the inferred likelihood of a snow day on Tuesday, 2025‑12‑30, based solely on the weather pattern is low, and the overall assessment carries medium confidence."

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Expert agreement:\n- Meteorologist: Tuesday 12/30 is cold, breezy, but mostly dry with under 1\" new snow and no ice; main storm impacts are Monday.\n- Historian: This pattern matches a typical post-storm, cold-but-quiet day. Historical snow-day rates for similar setups are around 5–15%.\n- Safety analyst: Road and travel risk is low; morning commute impact is minimal, with plows/salt expected to recover the network overnight and normal bus operations recommended.\n- News intel: District is closed for Winter Break; no active snow-day decision and no wave of weather-related closures from neighbors.\nAll four align that Tuesday’s weather is not strong snow-day material and that routine operations (if school were in session) would likely proceed.\n\n2) Disagreements:\n- There are no substantive conflicts. Everyone calls impacts low for Tuesday itself. The only nuance is that the historian allows up to ~15% historical closure rate in rare cases where prior-day damage or drifting lingers, but current safety and news intel do not show widespread outages or catastrophic conditions.\n\n3) Plow timing math:\n- Worst conditions end: late Monday evening (around 23:59 on 12/29).\n- Morning bus window: roughly 06:00–08:00 on Tuesday 12/30.\n- That gives about 6–8+ hours of plow/salt time between the end of the main storm and first buses.\n- Safety expert explicitly states the network should be fully recovered overnight with no new accumulation between midnight and at least mid-afternoon Tuesday.\nThis timing is favorable to having roads in usable condition.\n\n4) Ice risk:\n- Temps stay in the 20s°F with wind chills below zero at times, but there’s no warmup/refreeze cycle or mixed precipitation flagged for Tuesday morning.\n- Safety analyst notes only a moderate risk of hard-pack and slick spots on untreated surfaces, not a glaze/ice-storm scenario.\n- Meteorologist: precip type is snow only, with essentially no Tuesday-morning precip.\nConclusion: no major ice event; just typical frozen/slick winter surfaces Michigan districts routinely handle.\n\n5) Neighboring districts:\n- News intel: no pre-emptive 12/30 snow closures widely reported for nearby Kent County districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, etc.).\n- Many districts are on winter break, reducing the significance of snow-day style decisions. Crucially, there is no signal of a regional “everyone’s closing for weather” move.\nThus, no +15–20% upward adjustment for neighboring closures is warranted.\n\n6) What would make this wrong:\n- An unexpected extension/renewal of warnings into Tuesday morning with heavier-than-forecast lake-effect bands dropping multiple inches right on the commute.\n- A surprise ice component (freezing drizzle or under-modeled freezing rain) creating widespread black ice.\n- Large, unanticipated power outages or serious damage from Monday’s storm not currently evident in the intel.\nThese would all require fresh data; as of the given analyses, they are not indicated.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH DEFINED WEIGHTS)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly supports school being able to run normally if it were in session: <1\" new snow, no morning precip, winds in the 15–20 mph range, and advisory products ending Monday evening. On Michigan’s threshold scale, this is well below 4\" and not a blizzard or ice event. This by itself points to a probability near the bottom of the 5–15% band.\n- Safety (25%): Road scores (7–8/10) and low risk classification confirm that primary and secondary roads plus parking lots should be manageable after overnight work. Morning commute impact is explicitly labeled \"minimal.\" This also argues for a low probability, again in the single digits to low teens.\n- History (20%): Past patterns like this yield closure rates around 5–15%. Historian notes that closures mainly occur when Tuesday inherits unresolved chaos from a much worse Monday, which we do not see evidence of here. Historical context therefore supports a low, but non-zero, probability.\n- News & intelligence (20% – secret weapon): The district is officially closed for Winter Break on Dec 30; there is no active snow-day decision. Neighboring districts are not announcing weather closures for that date. Community sentiment is focused on general winter conditions rather than school-closure campaigns. This strongly reinforces the idea that Tuesday’s conditions are seen as routine winter weather, not closure-level. Because there is also no regional wave of weather closures, there is no upward adjustment from this channel.\n\nQUANTITATIVE DECISION\n- Baseline from meteorology alone, using district thresholds: under 4\" snow and no ice ⇒ 5–15% range. With particularly benign timing and no precip in the commute, this skews toward the low end, around 5–8%.\n- Safety data: no need to nudge upward; if anything it supports staying near ~8% or below.\n- Historical analogs: support ~10% mid-point, but given the explicit present-day safety and road intel is good, we bias slightly below that historical mid-point.\n- News intel: because Rockford is on break and there is no sign of neighbors closing specifically because of Dec 30 weather, there is no +10–20% adjustment. If anything, it confirms that local decision-makers are not treating this as a borderline day.\n\nReconciling these and avoiding unjustified clustering in the middle (40–60%), the best calibrated probability is 8% for a *true* weather-driven snow day, if school were scheduled. This keeps us within the Michigan guidance band (<4\" ⇒ 5–15%) while leaning toward the lowest plausible value, consistent with the strong cross-expert agreement and the lack of any ice/blizzard signal.\n\nNote: In reality, there is 0% chance of a calendar-defined snow day because the district is already on Winter Break. Here, 8% reflects the hypothetical probability of a closure *if* December 30 were a regular school day.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
