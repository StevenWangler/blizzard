Precip amounts are light (~0.01\" liquid equivalent), but the precip type is flagged as light freezing rain overnight into early morning (notably around 00:00, 03:00, 05:00–06:00). Even a glaze is a major hazard in Michigan—bridges, ramps, sidewalks, and untreated secondary roads can become slick quickly. Winds are modest (max ~14 mph) but cold enough to keep wind chills below zero early. Visibility is the other concern: the forecast shows periods of extremely low visibility (0 miles at 00:00 and again at 23:00 with freezing fog), with lingering 3–6 mile visibility around the commute window. Snow accumulation is essentially nil, so plowing isn’t the issue; the risk is a thin, hard-to-treat ice glaze during the pre-dawn hours (when road temps are coldest). Net: elevated delay/closure risk driven by freezing rain/ice potential rather than snow, especially if the freezing rain overlaps 3–7 AM."

In Michigan, that setup more commonly produces a DELAY than a closure unless ice becomes widespread or visibility crashes. Biggest swing factor is how much Tuesday’s advisory conditions (snow/blowing snow) linger into early Wednesday and whether the pre-dawn freezing rain actually deposits a glaze on untreated roads."

    "verification_summary": "For the target school day Wednesday 2026-01-28 in Rockford, MI (49341), your WeatherAPI hourly forecast shows wind-chill/feels-like values generally between about -12°F and 0°F, with the coldest values around 7–9 AM near -7°F (example: 08:00 feelslike_f ≈ -7.3°F) and overnight lows near -11.5°F around 01:00. None of the values in the provided API forecast for 2026-01-28 fall below the critical -20°F threshold.\n\nCross-checking the web: an NWS-based 7-day forecast reprint (published 2026-01-27) indicates Wednesday will have a high near ~14°F with wind chills down to roughly -11°F, consistent with your API's general wind-chill range and well above the -20°F trigger. Weather Underground precipitation pages support only light snow/precip amounts and do not provide a clean 'feels like' value in the captured snippet.\n\nHowever, the Weather.com hourly snippets returned by the web tool appear cached/stale and in some cases clearly correspond to other calendar dates (showing different Wednesdays), so they cannot be treated as a precise, date-specific verification for 2026-01-28's wind chill. Based on the NWS-derived text forecast and your API values, there is no evidence (in the captured sources) of a below -20°F wind chill for Rockford/Kent County on 2026-01-28.\n\nSnow day signal: Your API indicates very minimal precip (0.01\" liquid, 0 snow) for 2026-01-28, though it flags 'light freezing rain' with high precip chances. With temps near/just below 0°F overnight and daytime highs near 14°F, any freezing drizzle/patchy freezing fog could create slick spots, but this is more of a 'delay/drive carefully' risk than a classic snow-day setup. The stronger closure risk from cold alone is NOT met because the verified/consistent wind-chill guidance is around -11°F, not below -20°F.",

This matters for how widespread/rapid the glaze becomes, but both paths still support slick spots given sub-freezing temps and prior-day impacts.\n3) Plow timing math: ‘Snow end’ is less relevant than ice/refreeze. Infrastructure indicates residential streets are not expected to be fully serviced before bus routes; that aligns with safety’s high ice-formation risk through ~07:00. Even if arterials are passable by ~06:30, bus routes still face subdivision streets/stop approaches.\n4) Any ice? YES—multiple experts flag high ice risk via refreeze and potential freezing drizzle; even patchy black ice can be closure-level when it coincides with buses.\n5) Neighboring districts: Now confirmed strong—FOX 17 lists Rockford Public Schools CLOSED for Wed Jan 28, and also lists Forest Hills and Kentwood closed (3+ area closures signal per your rubric).\n6) Power outages: Consumers systemwide outages extremely low; no strong outage-driven closure signal.\n7) Wind chill verification: Cross-sources show cold but above the -20F trigger.\n8) What would make me wrong? If the FOX 17 closings list were erroneous/outdated or Rockford reversed to ‘open/delay,’ or if conditions ended up much better (no glaze + residential roads unexpectedly clear). Given the explicit listing of Rockford as CLOSED, the dominant risk is being underconfident, not overconfident.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% (supports ice/refreeze window but low QPF), Safety 25% (high ice risk during commute on secondary roads), History 15% (delay-leaning analogs), News Intel 15% (OVERRIDE-UP: confirmed Rockford listed closed + multiple nearby closures), Infrastructure 10% (residential lag), Power 5% (no outage driver), Web verifier 5% (no -20F trigger; some precip-type uncertainty).

The most consequential signal is light freezing rain/drizzle pre-dawn (especially ~05:00–06:00) when pavement temps are coldest; even minimal accretion can create patchy black-ice conditions that are hard to detect and can disrupt bus routes. That said, without stronger QPF, stronger winds, or an active advisory extending into Wednesday morning, the base rate favors a delay over a full cancellation. I therefore place snow-day (closure) probability in the high-20s, with meaningful uncertainty driven by how much icing actually materializes and how much Tuesday’s lake-effect/blowing snow leaves behind as hard-pack/refreeze on secondary roads.",

Historically, even tiny QPF can create a glaze on untreated roads/parking lots and push decisions upward—more often delays than full closures unless it becomes widespread.",

That said, the forecast liquid amount is minimal and winds are not extreme, and the infrastructure agent expects main roads to be largely treated/passable by ~06:30. That combination typically produces a *delay* more often than a full closure in West Michigan unless the glaze becomes more widespread than forecast or visibility drops to near-zero at commute time.

The most consequential signal is light freezing rain/drizzle pre-dawn (especially ~05:00–06:00) when pavement temps are coldest; even minimal accretion can create patchy black-ice conditions that are hard to detect and can disrupt bus routes. That said, without stronger QPF, stronger winds, or an active advisory extending into Wednesday morning, the base rate favors a delay over a full cancellation. I therefore place snow-day (closure) probability in the high-20s, with meaningful uncertainty driven by how much icing actually materializes and how much Tuesday’s lake-effect/blowing snow leaves behind as hard-pack/refreeze on secondary roads."

The lack of accumulating snow on Wednesday and only moderate wind/chill severity usually keeps schools open. However, the combination of (1) Tuesday’s advisory-level travel impacts and (2) pre-dawn freezing drizzle potential at very cold temps creates a meaningful risk of widespread slick spots on secondary/residential roads during the bus window. I land at ~28% for a full snow day (closure), with a higher implied probability for a delay than a closure."

That said, the forecast liquid amount is minimal and winds are not extreme, and the infrastructure agent expects main roads to be largely treated/passable by ~06:30. That combination typically produces a *delay* more often than a full closure in West Michigan unless the glaze becomes more widespread than forecast or visibility drops to near-zero at commute time. Net: meaningful but not dominant closure probability; higher likelihood of a 1–2 hour delay than a district-wide cancellation."

The FOX 47 crash live-blog plus a same-day university early closure signal that conditions have already crossed a disruption threshold regionally on Tue, Jan 27. However, the lack of a continuing NWS advisory into Wed and the absence of any Rockford-specific closure notice at the time checked make a full closure less likely. Netting those together, I land in the high-20s: meaningful chance of *some* schedule change, but still more likely than not that school opens (possibly with a delay)."
