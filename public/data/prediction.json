Temperatures stay in the mid-teens °F with wind chills near or just below 0°F at times, and remain below freezing all day (24+ hours of subfreezing temps). Periods of moderate to occasionally heavy snow showers persist from just after midnight through at least late afternoon, with the heaviest around the 4–9 AM commute window and again mid/late afternoon. Model guidance shows roughly 1.5–2.0 cm of new snow (~0.6–0.8\") for the calendar day, on top of several inches that fall Saturday–Sunday under the existing Winter Weather Advisory. Winds from the WNW/NW gust 15–20 mph, adding some blowing/drifting and wind-chill impact but not blizzard criteria. Visibility frequently runs 2–4 miles, occasionally dropping to around 1 mile in heavier bands. Roads will be snow covered and slick, especially untreated or rural routes, but accumulations and wind are within what West Michigan schools routinely handle, and the ongoing event is more of a persistent lake-effect/clipper pattern than a disruptive storm. With plows operating continuously through the weekend, the most likely outcome is school operating on time, possibly with localized slow travel rather than widespread closure. Overall: low probability of a full snow day, with a modest chance of minor delays if lake-effect bands are particularly intense during the early commute."

    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast for Monday, January 19, 2026 in Rockford, Michigan, the pattern strongly resembles a typical mid-winter lake-effect regime rather than a major closure event. Total new snow for Monday is relatively light (~0.5–1.0\" during the commute and perhaps around an inch over the full day), with visibility occasionally reduced (down to ~1–3 miles) in heavier bursts between roughly 5–10 AM. Winds 10–16 mph produce wind chills mostly in the -5°F to -15°F range, flirting with but not consistently breaching the extreme-cold threshold that has historically triggered closures in Michigan (< -15°F sustained wind chill, often colder). \n\nFrom a historical decision-making standpoint in Kent County and the Rockford area:\n- Snow amounts: This event is well below the 8–10+ inches in a single storm window that more commonly influences closures, especially when the bulk falls overnight into the early morning. Instead, this is a continuation of a weekend 1–4\" advisory event with scattered follow-on showers.\n- Precipitation type: The Sunday forecast does include some light freezing rain or mixed precipitation early, but by Monday the profile is predominantly snow with no significant ice accretion signal. Ice storms are a much more frequent closure trigger than light to moderate snow alone.\n- Timing: Snow is ongoing before and during the bus window (approximately 6–9 AM), so roads will be slick and visibility variable. However, accumulation rates indicated (on the order of a tenth to a couple tenths of an inch of snow per hour, not sustained whiteout) are generally within what local plow operations and drivers manage on a regular school day.\n- Wind/visibility: Gusts to around 20–30 kph (mid-teens mph) with occasional heavier snow showers can briefly drop visibilities to near 1–2 miles. This is noticeable but short of blizzard criteria (which would require frequent gusts ≥35 mph and near-zero visibility with heavy snow and blowing snow for several hours).\n\nComparing to historical patterns for Rockford in mid-January, similar advisory-level lake-effect setups with 1–4\" spread over a couple of days, cold but not dangerously low wind chills, and continuous but not extreme squall activity usually result in school operating on schedule. Closures are more commonly tied to:\n- A much larger, well-timed dump of snow (8–10\"+ between late night and early morning),\n- A strong, persistent lake-effect band locked over the district producing near-whiteout conditions at bus time, or\n- A true arctic outbreak where morning wind chills remain below about -15°F to -20°F.\n\nNone of those stronger triggers are clearly met in this forecast. The weekend Winter Weather Advisory is typical for the region and set to be winding down by early Sunday, giving crews a full day plus overnight to address main routes before Monday’s commute. Monday’s additional light to moderate snow showers will require caution but are unlikely, by historical standards, to justify a full snow day district-wide. \n\nOverall, the historical context for Rockford and the broader west Michigan lake-effect belt suggests that while Monday’s conditions will be wintry, slick, and somewhat reduced in visibility, the probability of a snow day or widespread closure based solely on this forecast pattern is low to perhaps low-moderate at most."

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorology: Monday 1/19 has cold, wintry conditions with light additional snow (~0.6–0.8\"), gusty winds (15–20 mph), and subfreezing temps all day.\n- History: This pattern is a typical mid-January West Michigan lake-effect regime—advisory-level, not a major storm; schools usually remain open in similar conditions.\n- Safety: Roads will be slick, with significant morning-commute impact but conditions that Michigan systems can generally manage with plows and cautious driving.\n- News Intelligence: Monday is a non-instructional day for Rockford due to MLK Jr. Day; weather is not driving the closure.\n\nAll four agree the weather is wintry but not catastrophic, and that there is no *new* storm-level trigger that would force closures beyond existing plans.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist & Historian: Both lean toward a LOW chance of a *weather-based* snow day if school were in session.\n- Safety Analyst: Describes conditions as warranting caution, possibly consistent with a delay, but not specifically calling for closure.\n- News Intel: Effectively says the question of a snow day is moot—students are off for a scheduled holiday, independent of weather.\n\nThe only real tension is between “low weather-driven closure probability” (meteo/history/safety) and “closure is already 100% scheduled” (news). There is **no** conflict about the weather severity itself.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window per safety: 00:00–10:00 on 1/19.\n- Meteorology: Snow showers persist through the early commute (heaviest 4–9 AM) with lingering activity into late afternoon.\n- That means there is **no long gap** when snow fully stops before the 7:40 AM bell; instead, plows work *during* ongoing light to moderate snow.\n- Practically: crews have been plowing since the weekend, so primary routes will be passable but repeatedly re-covered between passes. Effective “clean window” is close to **0 hours** of no snow before first bell—consistent with slick, not catastrophic, conditions.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorology for Monday: precipitation type is snow; temps remain well below freezing; no new freezing-rain signal.\n- Historian: notes earlier *Sunday* light mixed precip in the broader pattern, but Monday is predominantly snow.\n- Safety: flags **high ice formation risk** from refreeze and ongoing cold, not from active ice storm. This is patchy/black ice on untreated surfaces, not glaze ice on trees/lines.\n\nConclusion: No major ice storm or accretion; ice risk comes from cold, compacted snow and refreeze—serious for traction but routine for Michigan and below “ice storm” closure criteria.\n\n(5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News Intel: Most Kent County neighbors (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) customarily close for MLK Jr. Day. The intelligence indicates they are **very likely scheduled off** as well.\n- Importantly: these are *planned* federal-holiday closures, not last-minute snow days.\n\nPer your rules, 3+ neighboring districts closed typically adds +15–20% to snow-day probability. Here, that criterion is satisfied in a technical sense (many neighbors closed), but the driver is the federal holiday, not weather.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- If the district calendar or news intel were incorrect and Rockford actually had a regular instructional day on Jan 19.\n- If a surprise, intense lake-effect band locked over Rockford produced several inches (6–8\"+) of rapid snow overnight with near-whiteout conditions at bus time.\n- If a late-developing ice event (freezing rain) occurred Monday, causing widespread glaze and power issues.\n- If wind chills dropped into the sustained -15°F to -20°F range district-wide, triggering extreme cold closures.\n\nGiven the current data, none of these higher-impact triggers are indicated.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Shows <1\" additional snow on Monday, advisory-level winds, occasional reduced visibility, and continuous subfreezing temps. Independently, this supports only about a **10–20%** chance of a *weather-based* closure if it were a school day.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates conditions as **moderate risk**—significant morning impact but within Michigan’s capabilities. Recommends extra caution, possibly delay-like impacts, not clear closure. Implies roughly **15–25%** weather-closure probability.\n- History (20% weight): Historical snow-day rates for similar patterns are **2–10%**, strongly pointing to school being in session in a normal year.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, but functionally decisive): Confirms Rockford is **already officially closed** for MLK Day and that neighbors are also off. This turns the operational probability of “no school on Jan 19” for students into essentially **100%**, but for *non-weather* reasons.\n\nCombining the first three (weather-only lens) yields a low closure probability (on the order of 10–20%), consistent with Michigan thresholds: <4\" fresh snow, no blizzard, no major ice → 5–15% baseline. Safety concerns might nudge that into the low 20s at most.\n\nHowever, the News Intelligence layer overrides the decision context: the district has already chosen to close for a holiday. For the student-outcome question, the relevant probability is: “Will students have school on Monday?” That is overwhelmingly **no**, with closure already scheduled.\n\n3. APPLYING MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS & ADJUSTMENTS\n- New snow <1\" → baseline 5–15% for a *snow day* if school were in session.\n- No ice storm, no 8+\" event, no blizzard → no jump into 60–85% or 80–95% ranges.\n- 3+ neighboring districts closed → normally +15–20%, but here, those closures are due to the MLK holiday, not weather.\n\nTo honor both the weather logic and the real-world outcome:\n- Weather-based closure probability for this pattern, if Jan 19 were a regular school day: around **15%** (consistent with meteo/history/safety and thresholds).\n- Actual probability that students do **not** have school on Jan 19 (holiday + any weather noise): effectively **~100%**.\n\nFor the competition framing (Brier score), the operational question is “Will there be school?” Given multi-source official documentation, the best calibrated forecast is to treat this as a **near-certainty of no school**, while keeping a small allowance for the possibility of an administrative/calendar error or last-minute schedule change.\n\nThus I set the final **snow_day_probability = 95%** (very high but not absolute), reflecting: \n- 80–85 percentage points from the *pre-scheduled MLK closure* and widespread neighbor closure norms.\n- A minor upward nudge (≈+5–10 points) from the fact that, even if school were scheduled, conditions are at least marginally supportive of delays or heightened caution.\n\n4. WHY AVOID THE 40–60% RANGE\nExpert consensus on weather severity is fairly tight—light additional snow, advisory-level conditions, no major ice, no extreme cold. There is no genuine, high-conflict uncertainty between experts. The only point of tension is semantic (weather snow day vs. pre-planned holiday). That justifies a decisive posture (very high probability of no school) rather than a hedged mid-range forecast.\n\nIn summary: for Rockford students, Monday is effectively a snow day in outcome (no school), but the *cause* is calendar/holiday, not meteorological extremity.\n",
