Temperatures stay below freezing overnight (low around 24°F, wind chills in the low teens) and slowly rise to just above freezing in the afternoon (max around 33°F). Winds increase into the 10–18 mph range with gusts into the low-to-mid 20s mph, producing noticeable wind chill but not damaging wind. Crucially, there is no forecast precipitation: hourly data show 0.00\" precip and 0 snow all day and night, with model chances of snow and rain both at 0%. Visibility is generally 4–6 miles, occasionally as low as about 1 mile in thicker low clouds or patchy fog, but not at blizzard or heavy-snow levels. Prior winter storm alerts for surrounding counties (Winter Storm Warning and Winter Weather Advisory) end early Tuesday morning, more than 24 hours before the Wednesday morning commute. Roads may be somewhat snow-packed or icy in spots from earlier events, but with no new snow or ice during the overnight and commute period, road crews in West Michigan should easily keep main routes and bus lines in good condition. Overall, this pattern—dry, cold, breezy, and simply overcast—is well within normal winter operating conditions for Michigan schools. Based on the forecast alone, the likelihood of a weather-related school closure or delay for Wednesday 2025-12-03 is very low."

      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Local elevation variations around Rockford can slightly enhance prior lake-effect snow accumulation on the higher ridges, but with no ongoing snow or ice on 2025-12-03, elevation-related differences mainly affect how long old snowpack persists on side roads, not enough to broadly justify a closure."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the forecast for Wednesday 2025-12-03 in Rockford, Michigan—dry and overcast, no forecast snow or ice, temperatures in the 20s to low 30s°F, and wind chills staying roughly 10–15°F above zero—the setup does not align with historical closure patterns in this region. Michigan districts, including those in West Michigan, almost never cancel solely for cold at these levels or for routine post-storm slick spots when no additional precipitation is falling. Historically comparable days (cold, gray, breezy, but dry and post-storm) almost always have school in session, with at most minor delays if localized refreeze is worse than expected. Therefore, the implied probability of a snow day for Wednesday 2025-12-03 is very low, and the historical context strongly supports a normal school day proceeding as scheduled."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- AGREEMENTS:\n  • All four experts agree there is no major storm affecting Rockford on the morning of Wed 12/03.\n  • Meteorologist: 0% snow, 0\" accumulation; dry, overcast, cold.\n  • Historian: This pattern (cold, gray, post-storm, no new precip) almost never produces closures; historical snow-day rates 1–5%.\n  • Safety analyst: Primary and secondary roads 8–9/10, low risk; only routine patchy black ice expected; explicitly says conditions do NOT justify a snow day or delay.\n  • News intel: No closures posted, no strong community expectation of a snow day, no Rockford-specific alerts.\n\n- APPARENT DISAGREEMENTS (and resolution):\n  • Meteorology vs. news intel wording: The meteorologist’s detailed forecast says 0% precip and 0\" snow; one news/headline blurb mentions “intermittent light snow and flurries with slick spots.” In West Michigan, models often show trace flurries with effectively 0 measurable accumulation, which is consistent with both: a technical 0\" forecast and a public headline emphasizing possible slick spots. With roads already plowed and temps cold and steady, this produces minor, not closure-level, impact. No other data suggest substantial snow.\n  • Safety vs. news intel on severity: Safety analysis characterizes travel impact as minimal, consistent with the more cautious yet non-alarmist tone of the news intel. Both say ‘watch for slick spots’ but ‘not a major storm’.\n\n  After cross-referencing, there is no meaningful conflict: all point to a routine cold, possibly slightly slick, early-December morning.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Last impactful advisories and warnings in nearby counties expire early Tuesday 12/02 at 07:00, more than 24 hours before the Wednesday 12/03 commute.\n- No new snow is forecast Tuesday day/night for Rockford, just cold and overcast.\n- That gives road crews effectively all day Tuesday and Tuesday night for cleanup before buses roll around ~7:00–7:40 AM Wednesday.\n- Hours from meaningful snow end (early Tue morning) to school start (Wed ~7:40 AM): roughly 24–26 hours.\n- With that much lead time and no new accumulation, West Michigan plow/salt operations can easily clear main routes and major bus corridors; any remaining issues are limited, localized slick patches.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Temperatures stay in the 20s°F overnight with a slow rise toward freezing later Wednesday.\n- Safety analyst flags ice risk as “moderate,” meaning:\n  • Existing melt/slush from the prior storm stays frozen.\n  • Spot black ice in shaded/untreated side streets, parking lots, and bridges is possible.\n- Crucially:\n  • There is no freezing rain, drizzle, or active icing event forecast.\n  • This is routine post-storm refreeze, not a glaze-ice storm.\n  • Emergency access concern is explicitly marked false.\n\n  In Michigan, this level of residual slickness is handled with standard caution and salting, not widespread closure.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior (secret-weapon weighting)\n- News intel explicitly states:\n  • No neighboring closures listed on FOX 17’s closings board for 12/03.\n  • No official closure announcements from key nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n  • Community/social chatter shows no strong consensus expecting a snow day.\n- Per the rules:\n  • 3+ neighboring districts closed ⇒ +15–20% bump. That condition is NOT met (0 districts closed so far).\n  • Community expecting closure ⇒ +10–15% bump. Also NOT met; sentiment is ‘uncertain but leaning open.’\n  • If community says “this is nothing,” lean lower. Here, the signal is closer to “nothing major, just be careful,” which supports staying at the low end.\n\n  Therefore, the news-intel weighting (20%) pulls the probability down toward the historical/meteorological baseline, with no positive bump.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Forecast supports extremely low closure probability because there is no active storm, no accumulation, and only moderate wind chills. Alone, this suggests ~2–5%.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Risk rated low; explicit recommendation: normal schedule, no closure/delay needed. This also points near 5%.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Direct analogs show 1–5% closure rates with high confidence. Slight seasonal adjustment downward. This anchors the lower bound.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight):\n  • No neighboring closures, no pre-emptive Rockford signal, mixed-but-quiet chatter. That supports ‘school in session,’ again ~5–10% at most.\n\n  Combining these: the blended, weighted estimate clusters tightly at the low end (roughly 3–8%). Selecting 6% reflects both the tiny chance of an unexpected overnight issue and the strong consensus that conditions are routine.\n\n6. Why avoid 40–60% and be decisive\n- There is no genuine expert conflict: all four lines of evidence agree on LOW risk.\n- Michigan-specific thresholds:\n  • <4\" new snow and no ice storm ⇒ 5–15% typical. Here we have effectively 0\" new snow and no glaze-ice event.\n  • No 8\"+ totals, no blizzard, no ice storm, no extreme cold.\n- That places this day right at the bottom of the Michigan scale. Using 6% is decisively in that lowest band.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes (low probability but non-zero) are:\n- A surprise, heavier-than-expected lake-effect band sets up overnight directly over Rockford, producing several inches (4–6\"+) right into the commute.\n- An unforecast light freezing drizzle event causes widespread black ice rather than isolated slick spots.\n- A major overnight incident (multi-car pileups, significant power outages, or a water/heat infrastructure problem at schools) leads to closure for reasons only partly related to the forecast.\n- New, last-minute decisions by multiple neighboring districts (3+ closing) based on localized back-road icing could create pressure for Rockford to follow, even if main-road data still look manageable.\n\nGiven the current expert consensus and tools, these remain low-probability, high-impact outliers, justifying a small but non-zero closure probability.",
