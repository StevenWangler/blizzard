However, web validation quality is limited because Weather.com’s hourly details were not fully visible and several third-party pages did not clearly tie their hourly blocks to the exact date/time. There is also a large mismatch in 'current conditions' between WeatherAPI (17°F) and The Weather Network snippet (37°F), which reduces confidence in using any single web snapshot as ground truth.

The web verification did not find any credible source indicating extreme wind chills (≤ -20°F), so the extreme-cold automatic-closure rules do not apply. \n\nThe only meaningful disagreement was the safety write-up labeling ice formation risk as “moderate.” When clarified, this is not a widespread icing expectation—it's a localized, conditional black-ice concern (bridges, shaded curves, untreated subdivision streets, and low spots in parking lots) in the 5–8 AM window if there is leftover moisture/slush from prior days. With no new precipitation and temperatures rising after sunrise, that scenario typically leads to spot salting and minor caution messaging, not a district-wide closure in Michigan.\n\nSecond-order/community factors also point strongly toward being open: FOX17’s regional closings system currently shows no active closings/delays, Rockford’s site shows no closure/delay notice, and there’s no outage cluster in Kent County (county-level outages essentially zero). Net: a normal school day is the overwhelmingly likely outcome; a closure would require an unusual, non-forecast development (e.g., widespread unexpected flash-freeze/black-ice reports across bus routes, or a sudden localized facilities issue).

The provided forecast for Friday, February 27, 2026 shows none of those: no precip/snow signal at any hour, visibility stays good, and temperatures rise to the upper 30s by mid-morning and the 40s later. That combination matches a “quiet winter day” profile where closures are uncommon and, when they happen, are typically driven by non-weather factors (power, water issues, etc.) or a very localized untreated-road ice problem. Net: I’m at ~2% for a full snow day (closure), slightly above near-zero only to account for surprise patchy ice + operational conservatism in some pockets."

My best estimate is a very low snow-day probability, with the remaining risk dominated by non-forecast operational surprises (localized black ice from residual moisture, a sudden outage pocket, or a non-weather facilities issue)."
