Rockford is cold but quiet: lows around 19–20°F overnight, highs Sunday afternoon in the low 30s, with no measurable precipitation and no accumulating snow in the 24 hours leading into Monday. Winds are light (generally 5–9 mph), so wind chills only run a few degrees lower than the air temperature. The only notable issue is localized freezing fog and mist from roughly 2–8 AM Sunday with visibility briefly down to about 1 mile, but this occurs a full day before the Monday commute and there is no indication of widespread icing from new precipitation—roads stay dry with existing salt and sun on Sunday to clean things up. By Sunday daytime it is sunny/partly cloudy with good visibility, light winds, and no active storm in the region, and there are no weather alerts posted. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for snow and the complete lack of new snow or ice on Sunday into Sunday night, there is no meteorological basis for a snow day on Monday. Expect a normal school day with typical cold January conditions and dry roads for the Monday morning commute."

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast, the pattern for Sunday, January 4 into the Monday, January 5 school day is a classic \"cold and quiet\" setup following relatively modest snow on Saturday. There is no active storm, no significant new accumulation overnight Sunday, no ice, and no extreme cold or high winds. Historically, Rockford‑area schools almost always remain open under these conditions, with only isolated slick spots handled by normal salting and plowing. As a result, the historical‑pattern‑based likelihood of a snow day on Monday, 2026‑01‑05 is very low (on the order of a few percent), and my confidence in that assessment is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorologist: Describes a cold but quiet period Sunday into Monday with *no new snow*, light winds, and only localized freezing fog early Sunday, well before the school commute. Concludes there is no meteorological basis for a snow day on Monday.\n- Historian: Identifies very similar past patterns (cold, dry, maybe some prior light snow) with snow-day rates around 2–5%. Notes Rockford is accustomed to these conditions and typically remains open. Concludes a very low closure likelihood.\n- Safety analyst: Rates road and travel risk as low. Primary roads 8/10, secondary/parking lots 7/10, with minimal commute impact. Explicitly states conditions do not justify a snow day and that standard winter operations are sufficient.\n- News/community intel: District has clearly announced school resumes Monday, Jan 5 as a normal day; no neighboring districts are hinting at closures; social media is quiet (“no_buzz”) about weather-related disruption.\nAll four experts independently converge on: cold, routine January conditions with no active storm and no institutional or community momentum toward closing. There are *no material conflicts* in the analyses.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions (freezing fog and any minor slickness) run roughly 2–8/9 AM on *Sunday* (2026-01-04), not Monday.\n- By Sunday daytime, roads are dry or treated, with sun/partly cloudy skies and no additional precipitation.\n- From the end of the minor Sunday-morning issues (~09:00 Sunday) to the Monday first bell (~07:40 Monday) is about 22–23 hours of quiet, dry, sub-freezing weather.\n- Saturday’s 3–4\" of snow is handled Saturday–Sunday by plows with a full day buffer; there is no new accumulation Sunday night.\nGiven West Michigan’s robust snow operations, this is ample time for plows and salt to return roads to near-normal winter condition. Plow timing strongly favors *no* closure.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorological and safety analyses both note freezing fog/mist early Sunday, which could cause *patchy* thin glaze then, but that:\n  - Occurs a full day before school.\n  - Is mitigated by traffic, treatment, and drying through Sunday.\n- No freezing rain, drizzle, or mixed precip is forecast Sunday night into Monday morning.\n- Ice-formation risk is labeled “moderate” only in the sense that whatever is wet stays frozen in the 20s°F; this implies isolated slick patches, not widespread glaze.\nThere is *no active ice event* near the school commute. In Michigan closure practice, that’s critical: without ongoing icing, the threshold for a snow day is much higher.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intelligence reports no indications that Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD plan weather-related closures or delays for Monday, Jan 5.\n- There is no regional news, road commission alert, or social buzz suggesting a Monday storm or widespread hazard.\n- Rockford’s own communications frame Jan 5 as a normal return from break with no weather caveats.\nUnder the given rules, neighboring district closures would add 15–20 percentage points, and community expectations could add 10–15. Here, both are effectively zero or even bias toward staying open, so I *do not* adjust the probability upward.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\nUsing the prescribed weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): No new snow, no storm, no extreme cold → strongly implies near-baseline closure risk.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good primary roads, only routine slickness → reinforces open-school stance.\n- History (20%): 2–5% snow-day rates for this pattern; Rockford rarely closes for these conditions.\n- News intel (20%): Strong institutional signal of normal school day; no neighboring closures or buzz.\nAll four push to the very low end of the Michigan thresholds. For <4\" recent snow with quiet conditions and no storm, the guideline is 5–15%. Given the particularly clean setup (zero overnight snow, no ice, clear community expectations of opening), I place the probability at the *bottom* of that band—5%—to keep the Brier score tight while acknowledging a small tail risk of an unforeseen late shift.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThis 5% accounts for:\n- A surprise Sunday-night system developing after this analysis, bringing significant accumulation or ice into the Monday commute window.\n- An unexpected freezing drizzle or black ice event not in current guidance.\n- A major, late-breaking infrastructure issue (e.g., widespread power outages) not yet visible.\nBarring such a late-developing event, the most consistent and historically grounded outcome is a normal school day.\n\nConclusion: With all experts aligned, no conflicting signals, clear plow timing, no active ice, and no neighboring closures, the snow day probability for Rockford, MI on Monday, 2026-01-05 is about 5%, with high confidence that school will be open.",
