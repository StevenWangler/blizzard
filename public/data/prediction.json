The most concerning window is pre-dawn through mid/late morning: light freezing rain is indicated around 3–4 AM followed by snow (notably around 8 AM and again near 11 AM), which is the classic Michigan 'ice then snow' setup that can quickly overwhelm treated roads and cause bus/commute issues. Total modeled snow is modest for Michigan (~1.4\"), but visibility may drop to ~1 mile at times and winds 10–15 mph will add wind-chill stress and some drifting of lighter snow. Snow alone would usually be manageable, but the pre-dawn freezing rain risk (even light) is the 'great equalizer' and meaningfully raises the chance of delays/closures—especially if a glaze forms before plows and salt can fully catch up."

The main concern is the pre-dawn light freezing rain signal and the timing of snow bursts near the morning commute with reduced visibility (~1–2 miles). Overall this pattern more often supports a NORMAL day or a DELAY rather than a full snow day; a closure becomes more plausible only if the freezing rain produces a meaningful glaze or if a localized band boosts totals significantly above forecast right at bus-run time."

Follow-up meteorologist clarification resolves this as: Rockford most likely 1–3\" (2\" center), with 3–5\" lower probability if bands linger. News intel did not confirm active closures/delays.\n\n3) Plow timing math: Safety analyst confirms worst conditions extend to ~08:30, while first bell is 07:40 ⇒ effectively 0 hours between “worst ends” and bell (conditions still ongoing ~50 minutes after bell). That supports at least a DELAY risk, but not necessarily a full closure given low totals.\n\n4) Ice check: Yes—ice is the swing factor. Meteorologist confidence is moderate that a glaze risk exists 03:00–05:00, but low that it becomes a significant accretion event (QPF ~0.01\" order of magnitude). Expect patchy slick spots rather than widespread crippling ice.\n\n5) Neighboring districts: Not confirmed for Wed Jan 21 from reachable sources; no credible ‘3+ neighboring districts closed’ bump applies. Rockford’s site shows no Wed posting yet; social buzz not evident.\n\n6) What would make me wrong: (a) Freezing drizzle/rain overperforms and creates widespread glazing on secondary roads/bridges persisting into 06:30–08:30; (b) a narrow band stalls and pushes Rockford into the 3–5\" range with poor visibility right at bus-run; (c) an early cluster of crashes forces districts to close despite modest totals.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Modest snow but credible trace-ice risk + poor timing/visibility ⇒ pushes above a routine 5–15% snow-only day.\n- Safety (25%): High ice-risk rating and “worst overlaps bell” ⇒ supports meaningful disruption potential (delay more than closure).\n- History (20%): For this pattern, closure is uncommon; delay/normal are more typical unless glaze is widespread.\n- News intel (20%): No confirmed current neighboring closures/delays and no strong community buzz ⇒ keeps probability from jumping.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Michigan can handle ~1–3\"; without confirmed widespread ice or a confirmed closure-wave among neighbors, a full snow day is less likely. However, the ice-then-snow timing means a 2-hour delay is a very plausible operational choice. Therefore I set the full “snow day (closed)” probability at 18% (leaning decisively below 20%, not in the 40–60% zone).",
