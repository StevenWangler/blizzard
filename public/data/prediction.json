Temperatures stay well below freezing (overnight lows around 17°F, afternoon highs near 29°F) with persistent cloud cover and a steady south–southwest breeze around 10–14 mph, producing wind chills in the single digits to teens during the bus hours. Forecast guidance shows essentially zero precipitation all day and night, with no snow, no mixed precip, and no freezing rain signal; roads remain dry aside from any existing ice patches from previous days. Visibility holds near 6 miles with no fog or heavy lake-effect bands. There are no active weather alerts. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for cold and snow and the complete lack of new snow/ice, the meteorological risk of a snow day or weather-related closure on Friday is effectively near zero; normal school operations are expected."

In Michigan, especially West Michigan, schools rarely close for temperature alone unless wind chills drop below roughly ‑15°F, and rarely close for snow unless a well‑timed storm delivers 8–10\"+ or produces whiteout conditions. None of those triggers are present here, and there are no weather alerts. Historically, days like this are routine winter school days.

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, dry, cold day; no snow, no ice, no alerts; essentially zero meteorological risk of closure.\n- Historian: Past days with nearly identical conditions (dry, cold, overcast, typical wind chills) have a 0% snow-day rate; closures here are driven by big storms, ice, or extreme wind chills, none of which are present.\n- Safety analyst: Roads and travel rated very good (primary/secondary road scores ~9/10, low risk level). Some isolated refreeze possible but not enough to justify delay/cancellation.\n- News/community intel: No closure announcements from Rockford or neighbors, no TV/online closing waves, no significant outages, and community sentiment is more “routine winter” than “major storm.”\nAll four experts independently point to normal school operations. There are no substantive conflicts: slight wording differences (e.g., NWS mentioning generic light snow chances vs. the provided high-resolution forecast showing effectively zero accumulation) do not change the risk profile.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Forecast shows no new accumulating snow overnight or in the early morning.\n- Worst conditions window labeled 00:00–08:00 is essentially just the coldest part of the night, not active snowfall.\n- Because there is nothing to plow beyond standard spot-treatment/salting, the usual “hours from snow end to 7:40 AM” calculation is irrelevant; roads are already in good shape and will stay that way aside from isolated slick spots.\n\n3. ICE RISK\n- Temperatures remain below freezing for 24 hours, so any standing water can refreeze.\n- Safety analyst explicitly calls the ice formation risk “moderate” but couples that with very high driving condition scores and minimal commute impact, stressing this is about scattered slick patches, not widespread glaze.\n- Meteorologist and historian both note no new freezing rain or active storm; this is residual, localized refreeze only.\n- In Michigan, that level of ice risk is routinely handled with standard salting and driver caution and does not normally trigger district-wide closure.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / NEWS INTELLIGENCE WEIGHTING\n- News intel (20% weight and the main adjustment lever) reports:\n  - No advance closures or delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD.\n  - No preemptive local TV headlines about widespread closures for this date.\n  - No large outage-driven closure risk.\n- Per the rules, 3+ neighboring districts closed would add +15–20 percentage points; here we have zero such signals, so no upward adjustment is applied.\n- Community sentiment is “uncertain” but not alarmed and does not contradict the calm meteorological and safety picture.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS\nUsing the required weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Virtually no storm or precip signal → baseline closure probability ~1–3%.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good roads, minimal commute impact → supports the very low end of the scale.\n- History (20%): Historical closure rate ~0% in similar setups → pushes probability down further.\n- News intelligence (20%): No closures, no strong storm messaging, normal operations signals → no upward adjustments; if anything, it reinforces the low end.\nCombining these, a 0–5% range is justified. To avoid overstating certainty (because residual ice is not zero risk and districts can be conservative if surprise slick spots appear), I set 3%, still well below Michigan’s typical 5–15% floor for minor events.\n\n6. AVOIDING THE 40–60% BAND\nThere is no genuine expert conflict: all four domains converge on “school in session.” That makes any mid-range probability inappropriate. The event clearly belongs in a very-low probability bucket.\n\n7. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main failure modes would be:\n- An unforecast overnight freezing drizzle event or black-ice outbreak that significantly worsens road conditions before 5–6 AM.\n- A surprise, narrow but intense lake-effect band setting up over northern Kent County with a few inches of fluffy accumulation on untreated rural routes before dawn.\n- A non-weather factor (sudden large power outage, building issue, or district-level operational problem) emerging after this analysis.\nCurrent meteorology, history, safety data, and news intel do not support these scenarios as likely, but they are the primary ways the district could still call a snow/ice day despite today’s signals.",
