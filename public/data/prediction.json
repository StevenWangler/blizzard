Even tiny ice accretion can create slick bridges/overpasses and untreated neighborhood roads, but amounts here look very light (trace). Winds are light, so no blowing snow. The one legitimate wildcard is visibility: several overnight hours show near-zero visibility (likely fog/low stratus), and freezing fog late evening could add a thin glaze.

Safety and infrastructure correctly flag the failure mode: even trace glaze can make secondary/rural bus routes and bridges unexpectedly slick, and the possible freezing fog/very low visibility could tip operations toward a delay.\n\nNews intelligence is a key tiebreaker here and currently points DOWN: no confirmed closures/delays posted yet (FOX17 shows none active) and no community chatter/road-condition reports were found. Power grid risk is also low and not a likely closure driver.\n\nGiven (a) trace-icing magnitude, (b) mid-February ‘winter-ready’ operations, and (c) lack of closure domino signals, a full cancellation remains a minority outcome. However, because ice is high-impact and the peak window aligns with buses, the closure probability is not in the single digits.

The limiting factor for a full closure is the extremely small liquid signal (trace QPF) and no snow accumulation—conditions that usually produce patchy slick spots, not widespread impassability, especially in mid-February operations in West Michigan. That said, the timing (4–6 AM freezing rain/freezing drizzle) is the *worst possible* for bus routes, and the forecasted near-zero visibility is a legitimate operational risk. Balancing those, I’m moving my closure probability up from 12% to 18% to account for the fog/black-ice uncertainty and the fact that even trace glaze can be disproportionately hazardous when temps stay below freezing through the commute. I still think a 2-hour delay is more likely than a full cancellation."

Rockford-area districts generally don’t cancel for cold and minor slick spots in mid-February, but they *will* cancel (or more commonly delay) for morning ice if road checks show it’s widespread. Given the forecasted trace precipitation and light wind, my historical prior is: open is most likely, delay is a meaningful secondary outcome, and full closure is possible but still the minority outcome. Net: 20% closure probability for Thu 2026-02-12."

That said, the total liquid is extremely small and winds/snow are minimal, which generally limits the chance of widespread impassability in a West Michigan district that’s winter-ready. \n\nGiven the peer inputs, I’m **lowering** my prior 70% closure stance: meteorology (12%) and history (18%) make a strong case that this is more likely an *operational delay / caution day* than a full cancellation, unless road checks find widespread glazing or visibility is truly near-zero on bus routes. I land at **25%** for a full snow day (closure), with an implied higher risk of a 2-hour delay than cancellation."

Balancing that against the absence of current public closure signals/buzz and the very low precip totals, I’m lowering my prior 40% and moving closer to the met/history camp—but not all the way, because ice/fog events can flip decisions quickly at 5–6 AM. Net: 25% chance of a full snow day (closure) for Thu Feb 12, 2026; I suspect “delay” remains more likely than “closure.”"
