Snow develops around 3 AM and becomes moderate to heavy through late morning/early afternoon (heaviest rates around 8–10 AM), with forecast storm-total snowfall near ~8 inches (20.5 cm). That amount is above the typical ‘routine’ 4–6 inches Michigan can handle, and the timing is unfavorable (ongoing during bus/parent drop-off).

Visibility is the biggest operational problem: multiple hours at ~1 mile or less are indicated, with at least one hour showing near-zero visibility.

From snow onset (~03:00) to school start (~07:40) is ~4.5 hours, but it’s not a cleanup window—snow is actively falling and re-covering. Safety estimate: ~2.9\" by ~08:00 and meteorology estimate ~2.6\" by ~07:00, with ~6.2\" by ~10:00. That implies worsening roads *after* the decision point.\n4) Ice: No meaningful mixed precip Wednesday (all snow). Ice/glaze risk is low-to-moderate as an *underlayer* due to prior-day light freezing rain—enough to elevate slip/stop risk on untreated surfaces.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel did not confirm any Jan 21 closures/delays posted yet. That removes the usual “domino” boost.\n6) What would make me wrong: If the heavy band shifts away and Rockford only gets ~4–6\" with improved visibility by 6–7 AM, districts could run with a delay or even open; alternatively, if multiple neighbors close overnight, closure odds would jump higher.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 35% (8.1\" + peak 7–9 AM + visibility), Safety 25% (severe commute + limited plow advantage + secondary roads), History 20% (events like this often close when rates hit at decision time), News 20% (strong regional hazard context, but no confirmed neighbor closures for Jan 21).\n\nUsing Michigan thresholds: 8+ inches is generally 60–85% base. Because the heaviest snow aligns with the commute and visibility is a major limiter, I stay in that band. Because neighboring districts have not (yet) posted closures/delays, I avoid the upper end.
