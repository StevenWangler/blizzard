The more realistic closure drivers are (1) freezing fog/mist reducing visibility and creating slick spots on untreated roads/bridges, and (2) a localized power outage impacting a specific school building or key traffic signals. Based on current outage levels, power infrastructure is likely sufficient for normal operations, with only a moderate, localized risk.\n\nPower-grid adjustment to snow-day probability: +5% at most (scattered/localized outages), unless you see an overnight spike in Kent County outages or confirmed outages at school facilities.",

That scenario is much more consistent with a 1–2 hour delay than a full closure, and it also requires the fog to be widespread across the district right at decision time.\n\nGiven the forecast shows persistent high humidity/mist and explicit freezing fog overnight, I won’t go near zero; however, absent precip and with improving temps after sunrise, I keep full-day closure probability in the mid–single digits."

The credible safety issue is concentrated in the **early morning**: freezing fog/mist can create (1) **near-zero visibility** on rural/low-lying stretches and (2) **patchy black ice** where moisture deposits and freezes on cold pavement. Those conditions can justify a **1–2 hour delay** if observed broadly at bus time, but a **full-day closure** is uncommon unless visibility is persistently near-zero across much of the district and/or there’s confirmed widespread glazing/crash activity.

The only plausible hazard is **freezing fog with near-zero visibility pockets** around the early-morning window, which is more consistent with a **delay** than a full-day cancellation in this region.\n\nSo: **1%** for a weather-triggered snow day closure (essentially a hedge for an extreme, unanticipated icing/visibility event plus a discretionary ‘close buildings’ call)."
