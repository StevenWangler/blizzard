    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI, heading into the target school day Monday 2025-12-22, the key setup is a cold, dry high-pressure regime on Sunday (Dec 21) with no precipitation. Hourly data for 2025-12-21 shows temperatures in the upper teens to mid‑20s F all day and night, with wind chills commonly in the single digits above zero. Winds are WNW 10–20 mph, gusting into the 20s mph range, gradually easing by evening. Total QPF and modeled snow for Sunday are 0.00, and all precip flags are zero, indicating no new snow, no mixed precip, and no ice heading into the overnight.\n\nRoad-impact perspective for Monday morning: Because there is no snow or freezing rain expected on Sunday or Sunday night, plows will not be actively fighting accumulating precipitation. Existing surfaces will be cold and potentially slick in spots from prior events, but conditions are static, not deteriorating. Temperatures stay below freezing (around 18–24°F) from Sunday evening through the pre‑dawn hours of Monday, with modest WNW breeze causing wind chills in the single digits, but this is well within normal winter operating range for Michigan schools. Visibility is generally 4–6 miles with no indication of dense fog or blowing snow; the intermittent 0–2 mile visibility values in the model output occur even with clear/overcast and no precip flags and are best interpreted as localized/brief reductions or model noise, not a sustained hazard.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for cold and snow and the absence of any new accumulation or ice event in the 12–18 hours before the Monday commute, these conditions would not typically justify a snow day. Expect a cold, dry, mostly cloudy start Monday with normal operations likely. Ice is not a concern here because all precipitation has ended well before Sunday and there is no refreezing rain—just dry, subfreezing pavement and residual slick spots from earlier in the week."

Historically, Rockford and similar districts almost always hold school under these conditions: no new snow, no ice, no blizzard, and wind chills staying above the more critical -15°F threshold. Earlier weather on Friday (light snow and some freezing rain) is mitigated by a full weekend of road treatment and cleanup, and temperatures are cold but not exceptional for late December. Overall, the historical analogs suggest a very low closure probability—on the order of a few percent at most—driven mainly by the small chance of unforeseen localized road issues rather than anything implied by the forecast itself. Confidence in this low snow-day risk assessment is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorologist: Cold, dry, no new snow or ice Sunday into Monday; normal winter conditions, no reason for a snow day.\n- Historian: This matches a classic post‑storm, cold and dry pattern with historically very low closure rates (3–8%).\n- Safety Analyst: Road and travel risk rated low; primary and secondary roads and parking lots largely in good shape; only localized slick spots expected; normal on‑time start recommended.\n- News/Intel: Rockford Public Schools and Forest Hills are already scheduled to be closed for winter break starting Monday 12/22; no active weather‑driven closure chatter or alerts.\n\nAgreement: All four lines of evidence say there is no weather‑based justification for closing school on 12/22. The news intelligence adds that there is not even a regular school day to cancel, because winter break has already begun.\n\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- Possible tension: Safety flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in micro‑spots, but meteorology says no new precip and historian notes that roads are typically fine by Monday after a dry weekend. That is a nuance (localized slick areas), not a contradiction.\n- Overall, all experts converge on: low operational impact, routine winter cold, and pre‑planned calendar closure.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New snow/ice overnight: 0.0\" forecast; precipitation probability 5% or less.\n- This means there is nothing fresh for plows to clear between Sunday evening and Monday morning—just cleanup from Friday’s event, and road commissions have all of Saturday and Sunday.\n- By the school morning window (around 7:40 AM), roads have had ~48+ hours post‑storm with no additional accumulation. Effectively, the \"hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\" is on the order of two days, far exceeding any threshold where plow timing would threaten operations.\n- Safety analysis explicitly notes primary routes in good shape before 6–8 AM; commute impact minimal.\n\n3. ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain, no new precip, steady subfreezing temps; surfaces remain cold and dry or with old packed snow. No active ice storm or flash‑freeze signature.\n- Safety: \"Ice_formation_risk: moderate\" refers to localized refreeze (meltwater on untreated surfaces, shaded sidewalks, parking lot patches). This is a typical winter concern, managed with pre‑treatment and sanding, not a system‑wide hazard.\n- Historian: Events with similar conditions almost never trigger closures in Michigan; closures correlate with active ice events, not residual patchy slickness.\n- Conclusion: There is no significant regional ice event. Localized slick spots warrant caution and minor mitigation but not a snow day.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford Public Schools: Official calendar shows Monday, Dec 22, 2025 as the first day of winter break; schools are closed by schedule, not by weather.\n- Forest Hills Public Schools: Also on winter break starting Dec 22.\n- Other districts: Available calendars indicate similar break status; importantly, there are no live, date‑specific \"closed due to weather\" alerts for 12/22.\n- Social/media sentiment: Marked as \"no_buzz\"—no chatter about an impending closure, no complaints about extreme road conditions or a major storm on Monday.\n- Under the competition rules, neighbors being closed for break does NOT count as weather‑driven neighboring snow days, so it does not justify boosting the probability.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (MET 35% / SAFETY 25% / HISTORY 20% / NEWS 20%)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly points to normal operating conditions; on its own this suggests something like a 5–10% closure probability for a typical in‑session day.\n- Safety (25%): Labels risk as low, recommends normal on‑time start with minor precautions. This supports being at the very low end of any probability range.\n- History (20%): Analog closure rates 3–8% for such patterns, high confidence. This anchors us near the bottom of the Michigan thresholds.\n- News/Intel (20%): Critical contextual factor: there is no school day to cancel. Operationally, the probability of a *weather-caused snow day decision* is essentially zero because the day is pre‑closed for break.\n\nPutting these together for a competition prediction: If we were pretending 12/22 were a normal school day, the forecast and history justify a roughly 5–10% snow‑day probability (cold, but no active storm). Given that the calendar closure is non‑meteorological and the task is to forecast a weather‑driven snow day, the best calibrated answer is at the very bottom of that range.\n\nTherefore I set the snow day probability at 5%, with high confidence, because:\n- Weather and safety both signal routine, manageable conditions.\n- Historical closure rates for this pattern are extremely low.\n- News intel confirms no extraordinary circumstances or community pressure that would inflate the odds.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main ways this 5% call could be off:\n- A surprise, poorly modeled event: e.g., an unexpected band of lake‑effect snow or freezing drizzle Sunday night producing several inches or a glaze of ice by dawn.\n- Infrastructure problem: localized power outages or a major water/main or heating failure affecting multiple school buildings, independent of the weather forecast.\n- Policy choice: district leadership opting for an extra day of break labeled as a weather day despite benign conditions (historically rare but not impossible).\n\nNone of these are indicated by current meteorological data, historical context, or news signals; they are low‑probability tail risks. Hence a 5% probability with high confidence is the best Brier‑score‑oriented forecast.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: There is no meteorological justification for a snow day on Monday, December 22, 2025 in Rockford, and in practice the district is already closed for winter break, so no separate snow‑day decision is expected.",
