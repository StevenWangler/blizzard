    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford/Kent County on Thursday Nov 27 into Friday Nov 28, temps stay below freezing (upper 20s to near 31°F) with periods of light snow and light freezing rain today, tapering this evening. Additional accumulations around 1\" or less are likely in this specific forecast, though nearby lake-effect bands could briefly produce higher bursts and reduced visibility. Winds from the WNW 15–25 mph with gusts near 35–40 mph will keep wind chills in the teens and create some blowing/drifting, especially in open/rural areas.\n\nFrom an experienced Michigan school-operations standpoint: this is a impactful winter-weather day but not a classic widespread snow-day setup for Friday Nov 28. Snow totals are relatively modest, temps are steadily below freezing (no flash freeze), and the heaviest, most variable lake-effect and blowing snow conditions are focused during the daytime and early evening Thursday. By the pre-dawn bus window Friday, the forecast is dry, cloudy, and still cold with improving visibility and lighter winds. Plows and salt crews will have overnight to treat slick spots.\n\nBottom line for snow day chances in Rockford for Friday Nov 28: low to perhaps low–moderate (roughly 10–25%). Travel may be slow and slick in spots early, but conditions look manageable for Michigan districts that routinely handle light snow and cold. The main concern is residual icy patches from today’s light freezing rain and compacted snow, not ongoing heavy snow or ice at school start time."

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast and alerts, this setup matches many routine late-November lake-effect events in the Rockford/Grand Rapids area: light to moderate snow, gusty northwest winds, and some slick spots but not a major, high-accumulation storm. Historically, Rockford Public Schools and other Kent County districts rarely close for this combination alone—especially when (1) additional snow totals are only 1–3\", (2) temperatures are near 30°F rather than extremely cold, and (3) conditions are expected to improve or at least stabilize rather than intensify overnight. In years past, similar advisory-level events around Thanksgiving through early December have produced some slow, hazardous commutes and minor fender-benders but relatively few full snow days; partial delays are more common when timing coincides exactly with a school-morning rush. For a typical school day following this pattern (like Friday, November 28 in your data) historical analogs suggest a relatively low probability of full closure and a modest chance of a delay only if leftover slick spots or narrow heavy bands are directly over bus routes at dawn. Overall, from a historical-pattern standpoint this looks more like a “drive carefully, allow extra time” event than a classic West Michigan snow day setup, which usually involves heavier totals (8–10\"+ in the core area), frequent whiteouts along primary routes, or much colder, more dangerous wind chills."

The heaviest/most variable conditions occur Thursday and taper by evening, with Friday morning expected to be dry, cold, and mainly cloudy. This gives plow and salt operations a full overnight window to address slick spots.\n\nHistorically, Rockford and surrounding Kent County districts almost never cancel for this combination alone—advisory-level lake-effect with 1–3\" totals, temps near 30°F, and improving conditions overnight. Analog patterns presented here cluster in the 5–20% closure range, and the more directly comparable examples are around 15–20%. The seasonal context further pushes odds down, as late-November events of this magnitude are routine and infrastructure is prepared.\n\nThe safety assessment highlights high ice risk and significant impact for the Thursday morning commute, but for the *following* school day (Friday) the situation is residual ice and slick patches rather than active heavy snow or rapidly worsening conditions. In West Michigan practice, that usually prompts slower routes, extra salting, and perhaps a delay if needed—not a full snow day. Considering the Michigan-specific thresholds (less than 4\" total, no major ice storm, no blizzard conditions at bus time), a low but non-negligible probability of closure is appropriate.\n\nBalancing meteorology, history, and safety, a decisively low probability near the upper end of the 5–15% guideline best fits the evidence, so I set the final closure chance at 18%, with a somewhat higher chance of a delay than a full snow day.",
