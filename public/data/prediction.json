Sunday’s forecast snowfall is modest (~0.7\" total) with light winds (max ~9 mph), which Michigan road crews and schools typically handle easily. The snow also appears to end well before the Monday morning commute (no precip shown overnight into early morning), which favors plowing/road treatment. However, temperatures stay well below freezing (likely single digits to teens) meaning any untreated/slushy spots can refreeze into slick patches—especially on bridges, intersections, and rural roads. Net: snow-day risk for Monday is low based on snow/wind/visibility, but there is a moderate ‘delay/targeted closure’ risk if extreme cold policies are triggered (wind chills around/below ~-10°F at times) or if refreeze creates widespread icy spots."

With winds not especially strong and no clear signal of a major 8–10+ inch event, a full closure is less likely than a normal open or possibly a delay if roads glaze up or a heavier snow band sets up near daybreak. Overall confidence is medium-low because we do not yet have Monday-specific hourly timing/amounts and school decisions are highly timing-dependent."

Weather.com’s Rockford hourly page also shows subzero wind chills (e.g., 'Feels Like -23°' in its hourly list), supporting that dangerously cold air is affecting the area. However, NWS Weather.gov point-forecast pages near Grand Rapids/Kent County show wind chills around -1°F to +1°F at their displayed update times (Thu 2026-01-22 afternoon). That creates a >10°F discrepancy that must be resolved with a same-time, same-location check (ideally a Rockford/49341-specific NWS point forecast and/or observation). Importantly, Monday 2026-01-26 (the school day) is not included in the provided WeatherAPI forecast; the detailed hourly you supplied is for Sunday 2026-01-25, where the lowest hourly feels-like in your data is about -11.3°F (not near -20°F).",

Most likely outcome is OPEN, with some chance of a DELAY.\n2) Disagreements: The only material conflict was the safety/infrastructure ‘worst conditions until 03:00’ vs the hourly precip ending around 23:00 Sunday. Follow-up resolved this: 03:00 was not supported by the provided hours; worst conditions are better defined as ~18:00–23:00 with a post-snow hazard tail to ~01:00.\n3) Plow timing math: Using snow ending ~23:00 Sunday, there are ~7.5 hours until ~06:30 bus rollout and ~8 hours 40 minutes until ~07:40 start—typically enough for trunklines and main arterials. The limiting factor remains neighborhood streets/turnarounds.\n4) Ice: No explicit freezing rain signal for Sunday night in the provided forecast (precip type = snow), but ice formation/refreeze risk is elevated due to extreme cold and earlier-period icing context. This raises delay risk more than full-closure risk.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Mon 1/26 closure/delay announcements found on district sites in a targeted scan (Rockford, Forest Hills, Northview, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Kent ISD postings). This removes a major upward adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Updated snapshot shows very low outages and decreasing trend; no evidence of a power-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verification indicates Monday AM feels-like roughly -10 to -19°F, not ≤ -20°F at bus time. The ≤ -20°F value exists in WeatherAPI ‘current’ for Fri 1/23, but that does not automatically carry to Mon 1/26.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) an unforecast lake-effect band persists/redevelops overnight Sun→Mon producing several inches or reducing visibility during 5–8 AM; (b) widespread hidden glaze/black ice forms on secondary roads; (c) a localized outage/heating failure hits one or more schools; (d) Monday wind chill trends colder than expected and crosses ≤ -20°F at bus time.\n\nWeighted decision (per directive): Meteorology (25%) supports low closure risk given <1\" and ending before commute; Safety (20%) and Infrastructure (10%) keep risk above ‘near-zero’ due to local streets/turnarounds + refreeze; History (15%) base rates for this pattern are low; News Intel (15%) finds no active Mon closure wave; Power (10%) not a driver; Web verification (5%) removes the ≤ -20°F Monday trigger.

Because the provided hourly data do not show snow continuing into the Monday pre-dawn/bus window and the forecast totals are under 1 inch, I keep full snow-day probability relatively low.

I set the snow-day (closure) probability at **18%**—elevated above a typical ‘0.5–1 inch snow’ day because (1) the area is already in a multi-day winter hazard stretch, and (2) hidden ice + powder can create disproportionate morning-commute risk even without big totals.",

The Sunday forecast shows *modest* snow (~0.7\" total) and light winds (max ~9 mph), which usually points away from a full closure.",
              "**Timing matters more than totals:** The heaviest signal in the provided hourly data is Sunday evening (starting ~6 PM 2026-01-25) rather than a pre-dawn Monday burst. Historically, when snow ends well before the 5–8 AM bus window, districts tend to run (sometimes with a delay).",
              "**Ice “memory” risk from earlier freezing rain:** There is a plausible historical pathway to a surprise closure/delay if Friday’s freezing rain (2026-01-23) left a thin glaze that never gets fully treated, and then Sunday’s light snow hides it. That’s the main historical analog that raises risk above “very low.”",
              "**Cold is operationally stressful but not sufficient by itself:** The extreme cold episode increases the odds of bus-start issues and very slick refreeze on untreated roads. Historically, though, closures are more common when wind chills are closer to ~-15°F or colder during the morning commute. The Sunday-night lowest “feels like” in the provided hourly data is around -11°F, which is more in the “delay possible” band than “closure likely.”",

Because the provided hourly data do not show snow continuing into the Monday pre-dawn/bus window and the forecast totals are under 1 inch, I keep full snow-day probability relatively low. I still elevate above ‘near zero’ because (a) extreme cold reduces treatment effectiveness and preserves hazards, (b) the timing of Sunday evening snow can compact overnight, and (c) lake-effect/local band variability could make pockets worse than the area-average."

I set the snow-day (closure) probability at **18%**—elevated above a typical ‘0.5–1 inch snow’ day because (1) the area is already in a multi-day winter hazard stretch, and (2) hidden ice + powder can create disproportionate morning-commute risk even without big totals."

The forecasted snow Sunday evening (1/25) is enough to create slickness that can persist into Monday morning because of the cold, but the total is relatively low and winds are not strong—so the most likely outcome is ‘open’ or ‘delay’ depending on how well secondary roads and bus turnarounds are treated overnight. I’m putting the full snow-day (closure) probability at 18%—higher than a typical light-snow event because cold + potential hidden ice can produce localized crash clusters, but still below 20% because there’s no strong signal for heavy snow during the Monday morning bus window or significant blowing/whiteout conditions."

Right now, the strongest concrete closure signals are backward-looking (Fri 01/23 closures nearby, WMU closures earlier in the week) rather than forward-looking for Mon 01/26. The weather inputs provided for Sun 01/25 point to nuisance-to-minor snow (under 1 inch) and light winds—conditions that usually produce ‘normal operations’ or at most a delay if neighborhood streets are slick.\n\nI land at 18% for a full snow day (closure) on Monday, 2026-01-26. That allows for a realistic tail risk: if Sunday evening snow bands overperform locally, if hidden ice is widespread, if extreme cold/wind chills meet local policy thresholds at bus time, or if operational issues (bus starts, staffing) cascade after several rough days regionally."

          "desc": "ESFGRR\n\nBitterly cold temperatures moving into Michigan over the next few\ndays will increase the risk of ice jams on rivers. While many\nlocations have already frozen over, ongoing ice growth will continue\nto increase in any open water areas.\n\nThese temperatures have not been seen for many years in West\nMichigan, which means that some areas that don't typically\nexperience river ice jams may have issues this year. Ice jams can\nresult in water levels rising much more quickly than usual, which\ncan catch people off guard. Anyone living or working near rivers in\nWest Michigan should prepare now for potential river ice and rising\nwater levels.\n\nWhile temperatures warm up a bit early next week, this overall cold\nweather pattern will continue through at least next week, which will\nkeep ice locked in place on the rivers.\n\n\nYou can always find the latest river level information at water.noaa.\ngov\n",
