The primary watch-outs are (1) any real glaze from the overnight freezing-rain signal and (2) whether the very low visibility values are real fog/stratus at bus time.

WeatherAPI forecasts temps roughly 10–17°F with wind producing wind chills mostly near 0°F in the morning and dipping to about -5.5°F late evening (with winds increasing to ~15 mph). When cross-checking public web sources, the most accessible extracted snapshots (Weather.com, WeatherBug, Weather Underground) do not show wind chills below -20°F for Monday; however, several Weather.com pages captured by the crawler appear to mix different date contexts, and none of the extracted web snippets cleanly confirm the exact Monday 2026-01-26 hourly wind-chill curve. Because the web excerpts are not unequivocally pinned to Mon 2026-01-26, the cross-source agreement on the Monday 'feels like' is weak. Based on the WeatherAPI numbers provided, Monday looks cold but not at the automatic-closure threshold; snow on Monday is essentially nil in the API (0\"), reducing the likelihood of a classic 'snow day' driven by accumulation. Main risk factors would be localized slick spots from prior freezing precip/snow and cold wind chills, but not a verified sub -20°F event.",

Meteorology clarified it’s more likely pockets/intermittent drops (0.5–2 mi common, near-zero in spots) rather than hours of true 0.0 mi everywhere.\n3) Plow timing math: Icing/precip ends ~12:00–01:00. That leaves ~5.5 hours to 6:30 AM bus roll and ~7.7 hours to 7:40 AM start—enough for treatment on trunklines/arterials, but not enough to guarantee clean neighborhood streets given subfreezing temps.\n4) Ice: Yes—non-zero risk (thin glaze/black ice). This is the biggest ‘surprise’ pathway.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel did not find confirmed Monday closures/delays in nearby districts; several show normal Monday calendars. No domino effect.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages low (~155 customers) with Kent extremely low; not a driver.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier cannot confirm with fresh sources, but nothing supports ≤ -20°F; WeatherAPI bottoms around -5.5°F.\n8) What would make me wrong: If (a) freezing fog becomes widespread with near-zero vis during 6:30–8:00 AND (b) spot checks find widespread untreated glaze on secondary roads/turnarounds, Rockford could pivot to a delay or even closure.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verification (5%).\n- Meteorology supports low closure odds but highlights patchy ice + possible low vis.\n- Safety rates the morning as high-risk operationally, but explicitly expects OPEN with a meaningful chance of DELAY rather than closure.\n- History anchors closures for this pattern at ~8–15% and notes fog-alone rarely closes.\n- News intel shows no neighboring-closure momentum.\n- Infrastructure expects ‘generally passable’ mains by 6:30 with localized slick spots.\n- Power is stable.\n- Web verifier finds no extreme wind chill trigger and cannot confirm a Dense Fog Advisory.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds: with ~0\" snow and only patchy ice/fog risk, the closure probability stays low. I set 16% (slightly above the debate average 15%) to reflect the non-trivial compounded risk of patchy black ice + possible low visibility during the bus window, but without the “domino” closure signals or verified widespread dense fog, a full closure is still unlikely.",

Monday’s forecast has near-zero new precip and no snow accumulation, which points strongly toward “open.”\n\nI’m not going as low as ~5% because there are two historically meaningful ‘surprise’ ingredients: (1) the brief freezing-rain/black-ice window around midnight with temps ~10–12°F (any untreated roads stay slick), and (2) the multiple hours of near-zero visibility values (if real and coincident with 6–8 AM bus time).
