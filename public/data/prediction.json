The main operational issue is snow timing: little/no snow overnight, then snow develops after the typical 7:40 AM start (around 9 AM) and persists into early afternoon. Total modeled accumulation is light (around 1.5 inches) with peak rates near ~0.5 in/hr, suggesting generally manageable road conditions for a Michigan district—more consistent with ‘school open’ and possibly slower travel/extra caution late morning. The most notable hazard window is roughly 9 AM–1 PM when snow is falling and visibility may dip to ~1 mile. Overall snow-day (full closure) risk is low; watch for a narrow upside scenario if bands intensify and produce >3–4 inches during school hours, which would be more of an early dismissal/after-school impact than a morning closure."

The forecasted snow total (~3.9 cm ≈ 1.5\") and the fact that snow ramps up after 9 AM both argue against a full closure in Michigan. The main ‘wild card’ is ice from Thu 2026-02-05 (freezing rain/drizzle) and overnight refreeze—if a glaze exists on backroads, even light Friday snow can hide it and push districts toward a delay or, less commonly, a closure. If Thursday icing verifies, closure probability moves from ~10–15% up toward ~25–35%; without meaningful ice, expect mostly normal operations with perhaps a higher chance of a 2-hour delay than a full snow day."

      "Key point for Rockford (Fri 2026-02-06): the heaviest snow is forecast AFTER the normal go/no-go decision window. 12–16 hours of “quiet” overnight (00:00–08:00) gives MDOT/Kent County a good treatment window, so a full closure is less likely than the daytime ‘moderate snow’ wording suggests.",
      "Expect primary roads (US-131/M-44 corridors) to be mostly treated and passable for buses by 06:30–07:30, but with intermittent slick spots on bridges/ramps due to temps near/under freezing and high humidity. Reduce speed on overpasses and shaded stretches.",
      "Secondary/neighborhood roads are the vulnerability: if today’s (Thu 2026-02-05) light freezing rain leaves a glaze, untreated residential streets and cul-de-sacs can stay slick into Friday morning even with no active precip overnight. Bus route supervisors should scout known hill/curve problem segments before 06:00.",
      "Plan for a ‘school day that turns messy’: snow ramps up around 09:00 and continues through ~13:00 (forecast shows visibility down to ~1–3 miles at times). That can create mid-morning traffic incidents and slower student drop-off/pick-up flow, even if buses got out fine at dawn.",
      "Parking lots / parent drop-off: prioritize plowing and salting by 06:00–07:00 because compaction + mid/late-morning snow can quickly create polished/slippery areas. Re-treat around late morning (10:00–12:00) if accumulation is ongoing.",
      "Afternoon dismissal risk is more about refreeze/flash-freeze later: snow ends early afternoon, then temps fall into the 20s with increasing N/NW wind. Any meltwater/slush from daytime plowing can refreeze after ~17:00, impacting after-school activities more than dismissal.",
      "Wind chill: forecast wind chills get down near ~0°F to -4°F late evening (22:00–23:00). That’s uncomfortable but NOT at the automatic-closure threshold (≤ -20°F). Cold exposure is a minor factor for the school day itself; it becomes more relevant for evening events.",
      "Operational mitigations that often avoid a closure in Michigan: run normal schedule but pre-authorize bus ‘slow routes’, consider limiting/holding field trips, and be ready to cancel after-school activities if roads deteriorate or refreeze begins.",
      "What would upgrade this to a likely snow day (even in Michigan): (1) snow starting before 05:00 with >1\" by bus time, (2) a true ice layer from freezing rain/drizzle overnight, or (3) visibility/whiteout from lake-effect bands with drifting (winds higher than forecast). None of those are clearly indicated in this dataset."

When cross-checking on the web, the Weather.com hourly page snippet aligned with that general magnitude (upper 20s with feels-like ~16°F and winds ~14–17 mph). However, an alternate Weather.com hourly URL variant returned dramatically different values (around -18°F with feels-like near -26°F), which—if truly for Rockford during 6–8 AM—would materially change the closure risk. Because these Weather.com pages conflict with each other by >40°F and I could not retrieve a clean NWS/AccuWeather/NWS point forecast snippet for Rockford within the tool results here, the web verification is inconclusive and requires immediate follow-up using the official NWS point forecast for Rockford (or nearest NWS gridpoint) and AccuWeather’s hourly/RealFeel for Fri morning to resolve the discrepancy.",

    "decision_rationale": "Cross-checking the experts, there is strong agreement that this is *not* a classic Michigan morning-closure setup: little/no precip overnight, then light-to-moderate snow mainly during school hours with totals around ~1.5–1.6 inches. Infrastructure inputs indicate roads should be mostly passable by 6:30 AM because agencies have an overnight treatment window, and winds are not in a drifting/whiteout regime. The key disagreement is the web-verifier’s internal Weather.com conflict, including one outlier showing feels-like near -26°F; per policy, any credible ≤-20°F during 6–8 AM would force 90–95%. However, the verifier itself flags that page as a likely wrong locale/variant, while the other Weather.com hourly snippet aligns with the API magnitude (upper 20s with teens feels-like). Given the broad expert consensus and lack of any other corroboration for extreme wind chills, I do not apply the extreme-cold closure rule here.\n\nThe realistic pathway to closure is the ‘ice masking’ scenario (Thu freezing drizzle/freezing rain residue + overnight refreeze) creating *widespread* slick secondary roads and bus turnarounds at 6–8 AM. Safety analysis clarifies that with temps holding ~29–31°F and no strong flash-freeze signal, black ice risk is more likely isolated (bridges, shaded/rural connectors, untreated neighborhood streets/parking lots) than district-wide—more consistent with an OPEN decision, possibly with operational mitigations, or at most a 2-hour delay if early route scouts find widespread slickness.\n\nNews intelligence provides an important tiebreaker: as of the latest check, FOX 17’s closings feed shows no active closings/delays and there are no date-specific posts from Rockford or nearby districts. That reduces the domino-effect pressure that often pushes borderline calls toward closure.\n\nNet: full closure is unlikely but not negligible due to the ice wildcard. Best Brier-score calibration in Michigan is to stay decisively below 30% for a light, post-start event absent confirmed ice/closures—so 22% is the center of mass.",

Those ingredients typically produce slower travel and possible mid-day impacts, but not enough snow by daybreak to justify a full closure.\n\nI’m placing the snow-day (full closure) probability at 18% to account for (a) the potential that Thursday’s freezing rain/drizzle leaves a slick base that refreezes into Friday morning, and (b) the nontrivial chance that the banding/convective nature of “moderate or heavy snow showers” overperforms locally and drops a quick 3–4 inches in/near the district.

That’s enough for slick travel and reduced visibility, but usually not enough by itself to justify a full-day closure in a well-equipped Michigan district.",
              "Temperatures near freezing during the event (roughly 31–33°F late morning/early afternoon) point to a wetter/slushier snow. That tends to be manageable on treated main roads but can quickly create slick/compact conditions on secondary roads and in lots—more “delay/slow routes/after-school cancellations” than “snow day.”",

              "Wind is breezy but not a blizzard signal: sustained ~10–18 mph with gusts generally in the 20s mph. That supports some blowing on exposed roads later, but widespread drifting/near-zero visibility looks unlikely with only ~1–2 inches.",
              "Wild card: antecedent icing. Thursday’s forecast includes light freezing rain. Even a light glaze that refreezes overnight can make the Friday AM commute notably worse than the ‘no precip before 08:00’ hourly suggests (black ice, bridges, shaded/rural roads).

That generally argues for staying open (with slower travel and potential operational adjustments).\n\nThe upward adjustment is driven by the *ice + masking* scenario: Thursday’s freezing-rain signal plus subfreezing overnight lows (down near ~9°F by the daily min) raises the odds that untreated/shaded/bridge surfaces are slick early Friday even if it isn’t actively precipitating at 06:00–08:00. If that verifies, administrators sometimes call a closure (or more commonly a delay) despite modest new snow totals.\n\nNet: full closure remains unlikely, but not negligible given the antecedent ice risk and the possibility of localized heavier snow showers/banding during the late-morning window.",

The only scenario that reliably breaks that pattern is a verified glaze/black-ice morning from Thursday’s freezing rain/drizzle signal—especially if the first Friday snow (~09:00) falls onto still-icy pavement and quickly hides it.

However, I’m still **above** the 18% cluster because the safety-critical “masking” scenario (Thursday freezing rain residue + Friday mid-morning snow) can produce outsized crash risk on secondary roads and in school lots even with only ~1.5\" total snow.\n\nNet: I put a **28%** chance on a *full snow day closure* for **Fri, Feb 6, 2026**.

Recent-area closure history (FOX17 story) supports that when conditions deteriorate overnight, closures do happen in this corridor—so if Friday morning road checks look anything like that, leadership could cancel even with only ~1–2\" forecast.\n\nStill, the lack of a clear, date-specific closure announcement and the forecast’s “quiet overnight → snow after 9 AM” structure keeps me well below 50%.

That generally argues for staying open (with slower travel and potential operational adjustments).\n\nThe upward adjustment is driven by the *ice + masking* scenario: Thursday’s freezing-rain signal plus subfreezing overnight lows (down near ~9°F by the daily min) raises the odds that untreated/shaded/bridge surfaces are slick early Friday even if it isn’t actively precipitating at 06:00–08:00. If that verifies, administrators sometimes call a closure (or more commonly a delay) despite modest new snow totals.\n\nNet: full closure remains unlikely, but not negligible given the antecedent ice risk and the possibility of localized heavier snow showers/banding during the late-morning window."

The only scenario that reliably breaks that pattern is a verified glaze/black-ice morning from Thursday’s freezing rain/drizzle signal—especially if the first Friday snow (~09:00) falls onto still-icy pavement and quickly hides it. Net: low-to-low-moderate closure odds, with delay odds likely higher than closure odds."

However, I’m still **above** the 18% cluster because the safety-critical “masking” scenario (Thursday freezing rain residue + Friday mid-morning snow) can produce outsized crash risk on secondary roads and in school lots even with only ~1.5\" total snow.\n\nNet: I put a **28%** chance on a *full snow day closure* for **Fri, Feb 6, 2026**. In my view the more likely adverse outcome than a full closure remains **a delay** (if AM black ice is observed) or **an early dismissal / after-school cancellation** if road conditions degrade during the 09:00–13:00 snow window."

        "shiftReason": "I’m modestly higher than my Round 1 (18%) at **22%** because the *decision-risk* is not the midday snow itself (which is more an early-dismissal/after-school issue), but the possibility that **residual/refrozen ice from Thu 2026-02-05** creates hazardous secondary-road conditions that get reported early Friday. Recent-area closure history (FOX17 story) supports that when conditions deteriorate overnight, closures do happen in this corridor—so if Friday morning road checks look anything like that, leadership could cancel even with only ~1–2\" forecast.\n\nStill, the lack of a clear, date-specific closure announcement and the forecast’s “quiet overnight → snow after 9 AM” structure keeps me well below 50%. My center of mass remains: **open is more likely than closed**, with a meaningful chance that Rockford (and neighbors) opt for a **delay** instead of a full closure if ice is confirmed."
