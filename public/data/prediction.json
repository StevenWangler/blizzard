      "elevation_impact": "Slight local elevation variations around Rockford can make some back roads cooler and a bit more prone to overnight slick spots, but with no new precipitation and only light winds, any patchy slickness would more typically be handled as a driving caution rather than a system-wide closure trigger."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast for Wednesday, 2025-12-24, conditions are quiet and marginally wintry: temperatures hover around 30–33°F all day, skies stay overcast with periods of mist or freezing fog early, winds are light to moderate (mostly under 10 mph with some gusts under 25 mph), and total snow and precip for the day are 0. This pattern lacks the main historical closure drivers for Michigan schools: there is no significant accumulating snow (well below the 8–10\" with bad timing often needed), no ice storm or freezing rain signal, and no extreme cold (wind chills are in the 20s°F, far above the ~-15°F wind-chill threshold districts typically watch). Historically, Rockford and similar West Michigan districts run school through days just like this without delay or closure, treating them as standard winter commute conditions. While localized slick spots are always possible when temps are near freezing and freezing fog is mentioned, the absence of active precipitation, storm warnings, or strong winds makes a weather-driven snow day highly unlikely. Overall confidence that these conditions would not cause a snow day is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert Agreement Check:\n- Meteorology: Temperatures around 31–33°F, light winds, very high humidity, no measurable snowfall or significant precipitation, routine winter day. Explicitly rates snow day probability as effectively 0%.\n- History: Multiple close analogs (near‑freezing, overcast, no accumulating snow, light winds, no advisories) with a historical snow‑day rate of 0%. Concludes that these conditions \"highly\" unlikely to cause a closure.\n- Safety: Identifies only patchy black ice risk from freezing fog/mist and refreeze, with primary/secondary roads rated 7.5–8.5/10, driving conditions 8/10, and explicitly states: \"conditions do not justify a snow day or delay; regular start is reasonable.\"\n- News/Intel: No winter weather alerts focused on Dec 24; regional media and NWS GRR emphasize the *next* impactful system (freezing rain after Christmas). No neighboring closures, no RPS announcements, no social‑media buzz. Signals normal operations.\nAll four domains independently support *no closure* and a near‑zero weather‑driven risk for Dec 24.\n\n2. Conflicts or Disagreements:\n- There are no substantive conflicts. The only note of concern is from Safety: \"moderate\" ice formation risk on isolated spots between about 4–9 AM. Meteorology and History acknowledge this as a routine marginal hazard, not a closure‑level threat. No disagreement on the overall decision (all point to school operating normally).\n\n3. Plow Timing Math (hours from worst conditions to start of school):\n- Worst conditions window: 4:00–9:00 AM (Safety timing analysis).\n- Rockford HS start ~7:40 AM (first buses on the road by ~6:00–6:30 AM).\n- But there is *no accumulating snow* to plow. Operations are about anti‑icing and spot‑treating.\n- Treatment can begin well before 4 AM; there is no backlog of snow removal, only brine/salt application, which works well at ~31°F with no new precip.\n- Therefore, \"plow timing\" is effectively a non‑issue: road commissions and school maintenance have ample time and capability to manage localized slick spots before and during early bus runs.\n\n4. Ice Consideration:\n- There is *no* freezing rain, no glaze‑ice storm, and no active icing system.\n- There *is* a moderate risk of patchy black ice from freezing fog/mist and refreeze of prior moisture, mainly on bridges, overpasses, and untreated back roads.\n- Safety scores: primary roads 8.5/10, secondary 7.5/10, driving 8/10; emergency access concerns: false.\n- In Michigan, this level of risk is handled by salting priority routes and issuing caution, not by system‑wide closure. This is well below the \"ice changes everything\" threshold (no widespread glaze, no >0.1\" accretion, no advisory/warning in place).\n\n5. Neighboring Districts & Community Signals:\n- Neighboring district closures: none reported.\n- District announcements: none indicating weather‑related closure or delay.\n- Community sentiment: \"no_buzz\"; no reports of bad roads, power outages, or event cancellations.\n- Per the weighting rules, lack of closures and lack of concern from the community *do not* justify any upward adjustment. In fact, they reinforce the baseline meteorological/historical assessment that this is a normal operating day.\n\n6. Weighting the Four Expert Areas:\n- Meteorology (35%): Storm‑level impacts absent, 0\" snow, 0% snow probability overnight/morning, no advisories. This heavily anchors the probability near 0–2%.\n- Safety (25%): Acknowledges moderate localized ice risk but concludes regular start is reasonable, no need for delay/closure. Slight upward nudge vs pure \"0%\" to account for non‑zero operational risk.\n- History (20%): Analog days like this historically have *0%* closure rate. Strong downward pressure toward 0%.\n- News/Intel (20%): Confirms no elevated concern and focuses attention on a later (Friday) freezing‑rain threat. No neighboring closures, no chatter: reinforces the near‑zero estimate.\n\nCombining these: the only argument *against* 0% is that patchy black ice is never truly zero‑risk, so a vanishing but nonzero probability (≈1%) is realistic and honest for Brier‑score purposes. There is no evidence for anything higher.\n\n7. What Would Make This Prediction Wrong?\n- An unforecast, localized flash‑freeze event that produces widespread black ice across the district between 4–7 AM (e.g., unexpected drizzle or a temperature drop several degrees lower than modeled), forcing last‑minute closure or delay.\n- A late‑breaking NWS advisory specifically highlighting widespread freezing drizzle or dense freezing fog with much worse road reports than currently indicated.\n- A major, late community or transportation‑department signal (e.g., multiple bus accidents or widespread emergency calls) very early in the morning.\nBased on the current data and multiple expert streams, these failure scenarios are low‑probability.\n\n8. Final Position vs. Michigan Thresholds:\n- Total snow: 0\" → below the <4\" category; Michigan guidance suggests 5–15% in that lowest band *when there is actual snow*. Here, there is none.\n- No ice storm, no accumulating snow, no extreme cold, no blizzard conditions, and no neighboring closures.\n- This justifies a probability at or very near 0%. To avoid an unrealistically perfect 0.00 forecast, I set 1% as a calibrated, non‑zero risk reflecting the small tail possibility of unforeseen icing or administrative decisions unrelated to weather.\n\nResult: Rockford Public Schools should operate on a normal schedule on Wednesday, Dec 24, 2025, with standard winter driving cautions but no delay or closure expected.",
