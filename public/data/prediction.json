After Sunday’s snow and blowing snow, conditions stabilize: no additional precipitation is forecast overnight or during the school day, with 0.0\" new snow, no freezing rain, and visibility holding near 6 miles. Temperatures remain below freezing early (upper 20s°F with wind chills in the teens), then rise to the mid‑30s°F in the afternoon. Winds are breezy from the SW/WSW (generally 10–18 mph with gusts around 20–23 mph), but not at dangerous levels and with no falling snow to reduce visibility. Roads may be slick in spots from prior snow and refreeze, but with all new precip shut off well before 4 AM and plow crews having all night plus the morning commute window to clean up, Rockford-area schools (which are very accustomed to winter weather) are very unlikely to close. This pattern strongly favors a normal school day with perhaps slower travel but no widespread cancellations or delays."

      "elevation_impact": "The modest elevation and rolling terrain around Rockford can slightly enhance local snow totals in some setups, but on Monday there is no active precipitation, so elevation-driven enhancement is not a factor; any remaining impacts come from residual packed snow/ice, which are typically manageable with normal winter operations."

    "confidence_assessment": "For Monday, January 12, 2026, the forecast shows a classic ‘cold but quiet’ day after a weekend storm: temperatures mostly in the 20s–mid 30s°F, wind chills in the teens, breezy southwest winds 10–20 mph with gusts near 30 mph, and—critically—no new snow, no ice, and no rain during the school commute or school day. In Michigan, snow days are seldom called for this combination alone. Historically, Rockford-area closures in mid-January are tied to: (1) heavy ongoing snow or whiteout lake-effect during the 5–8 AM window, (2) ice/glaze events, or (3) extreme cold with wind chills below roughly -15°F. None of those triggers are present here. While roads may still be partially snow-covered from Saturday/Sunday’s system, districts typically rely on overnight road work and treat this as routine winter driving, not a closure situation. Given the forecast details and typical West Michigan practices, the probability of a snow day on Monday under these conditions is very low (on the order of a few percent), and my confidence in that assessment is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1) EXPERT AGREEMENT & CONFLICT CHECK\n- Meteorology: Dry overnight and Monday morning, 0\" new snow, temps upper 20s to low 30s°F, breezy but not severe winds, good visibility. Explicitly calls this a non–snow‑day setup for Michigan.\n- History: Nearly identical post‑storm, dry, breezy Monday patterns produce snow days only ~1–3% of the time. High confidence that closures in mid‑January here need active heavy snow, ice, or extreme cold, none of which are present.\n- Safety: Roads rated good (8–9/10), only moderate refreeze/black ice risk on some secondary/untreated spots. Morning commute impact labeled moderate, afternoon minimal. Recommends normal operations with caution, not cancellation.\n- News/Community: District calendar and website list Jan 12 as a normal school day, no weather alerts or hints of possible closure. NWS advisory ends Sunday afternoon; no Monday advisory or strong media chatter. No neighboring closures.\nAll four agree there is no new Monday storm, no ice event, and conditions are typical Michigan winter with manageable roads. There are no substantive conflicts—differences are only in framing (safety uses the term “moderate” risk, but still clearly supports holding school).\n\n2) PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Precipitation from the weekend system tapers by early Sunday afternoon; there is explicitly 0% snow probability overnight into Monday.\n- That gives plows Sunday afternoon + evening + entire overnight to clear, salt, and widen lanes.\n- By worst window (5–8 AM Monday), residual issues are from refreeze/packed snow, not ongoing accumulation.\n- Time from last meaningful snow to a 7:40 AM start is well over 12 hours (effectively 18–24+ hours), which is ample for West Michigan road crews.\nThis strongly favors open school with only localized slick spots.\n\n3) ICE & WIND RISK\n- Forecast: 26–29°F at commute, rising above 30°F later; dry skies. No freezing rain, no drizzle, no mixed precip.\n- Ice risk is from refreeze only, described as moderate and localized (untreated side streets, lots, shaded spots). That is routine and manageable with targeted salting; not a district‑wide hazard.\n- Winds 10–18 mph with some gusts ~20–30 mph, but with no falling or loose fresh snow by Monday morning, blowing/drifting sufficient to re‑cover plowed roads is unlikely.\nSo there is NO true ice event; just minor black‑ice risk in spots.\n\n4) NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS (SECRET WEAPON WEIGHTING)\n- Neighboring district closures list is empty; no chains of Monday closures.\n- Rockford’s own website/calendar only show Jan 19 as a planned closure; no talk of Monday changes.\n- NWS advisory is specifically for the weekend and ends Sunday; nothing extends into Monday morning.\n- Social/media chatter: no strong signal of Monday danger, and no advance speculation about closures.\nPer the decision rules, the absence of neighboring closures and the lack of community expectation means we do NOT add the +15–20% or +10–15% boosts. If anything, this supports staying at the low end of probabilities.\n\n5) NUMERIC PROBABILITY CONSTRUCTION\nBase from meteorology (35% weight):\n- 0\" additional snow, no precip, subfreezing but moderate temps, good visibility. This is well below the Michigan threshold table (<4\" new snow, no ice). A meteorologist alone would likely put this at ~2–5%. I assign 4% from this component.\n\nHistorical patterns (20% weight):\n- Analog snow‑day rates 1–3%; seasonal context even knocks probabilities down further. I take 3% from history.\n\nSafety (25% weight):\n- Good primary roads, decent secondary roads, moderate morning risk solely from refreeze and some drifting. In Michigan practice, that is not cancel‑worthy. Safety‑only probability: about 5–8%. I use 6%.\n\nNews/Intelligence (20% weight):\n- No neighboring closures, no advisory, no district hints of concern. This reinforces the low end, around 3–5%. I assign 4%.\n\nWeighted blend (approximate):\n- Meteorology: 0.35 × 4% ≈ 1.4\n- Safety: 0.25 × 6% ≈ 1.5\n- History: 0.20 × 3% ≈ 0.6\n- News/Intel: 0.20 × 4% ≈ 0.8\nTotal ≈ 4.3%.\nGiven Michigan’s higher tolerance and the explicit historical 1–3% signal, I round slightly upward but stay clearly in the single digits to balance Brier score risk: final 6% snow‑day probability.\n\n6) WHY NOT HIGHER?\nUsing the Michigan thresholds:\n- New snow: 0\" (squarely in the <4\" → 5–15% category). But that 5–15% band assumes *some* new snow; with none, we should be at the bottom or below that range.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no extreme wind chills, no advisory, and no neighboring closures.\n- Historical rate specifically says this pattern yields closures only a few percent of the time.\nThere is no structural argument to justify getting near 15–20%.\n\n7) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nI’d be wrong high (school opens) if:\n- A surprise overnight event develops: unexpected lake‑effect burst or freezing drizzle creating widespread ice on roads and parking lots just before dawn.\n- An extension or new NWS advisory is issued Sunday night specifically for Monday morning, with stronger winds and ground‑blizzard conditions than forecast.\n- Multiple neighboring districts suddenly announce closures very late Sunday due to unforeseen localized conditions (e.g., major drifting and poor plow performance on rural routes).\nI’d be wrong low (school closes unexpectedly) if administration takes an unusually cautious stance not reflected in past behavior or data—e.g., reacting to isolated bad roads as if they were district‑wide.\n\nGiven all current data and Michigan norms, a closure on Monday would be a statistical outlier.\n",
