Total modeled snow is about 3 cm (~1.2\"), with temps near 28–31°F—cold enough for accumulation, but amounts are modest by Michigan standards. Winds Sunday are NW/NNW 10–15 mph (gusts ~18–20 mph), so some minor blowing is possible but not a whiteout setup. Key snow-day takeaway for Monday 2/23: if Sunday verifies (around an inch), plows and road crews should have ample time Sunday evening/night to clean up before Monday morning bus runs, making a closure unlikely. The bigger Monday risk would be any refreeze of leftover slush/untreated spots overnight into Monday morning, but with no heavy snow or ice signal shown here, the probability of a snow day Monday is low."

This is because the forecast snowfall amount is modest (~2.96 cm / ~1.2 in) and occurs mainly Sunday late morning–early afternoon, leaving many hours for treatment and cleanup before Monday commute. The main upside risk (pushing closure odds toward ~25–40%) would be any meaningful overnight refreeze/black ice or a thin glaze (even light ice can dominate decisions in Michigan). Confidence is **medium** because we do not yet have the explicit Monday-hourly forecast, and the closure-sensitive period is Monday pre-dawn through 8 AM."

      "Because temps stay below freezing Sunday (high ~31.5°F, low ~27.5°F), any slush that isn’t fully plowed back/treated Sunday afternoon-evening can compact and glaze. This pushes risk up more on neighborhood/rural roads than on highways.",

The strongest concrete local operational signal I found is Kent County Road Commission pretreating roads ahead of forecast freezing precipitation/ice, which can be a major driver of West Michigan school decisions if it leads to slick secondary roads or refreeze. I also found general (non-date-specific) closure decision/process guidance from Forest Hills and Kent ISD, but no Feb 23 closure posts.

The only meaningful pathway to a closure is if Sunday slush/compaction plus overnight temps in the upper 20s produce widespread slickness on secondary/rural bus routes (or if unmodeled freezing drizzle/light precip occurs pre-dawn Monday—something we cannot confirm from the provided hourly block, which stops Sunday night). News intelligence shows no Rockford or neighboring-district closure signals and no active closings page indicators, which keeps probability low and helps avoid the common ‘overpredict’ mistake in Michigan. Infrastructure expectations support passable main/bus-route connectors by 6:30 AM, with patchy black-ice risk mainly on lower-priority segments—more consistent with a possible delay than a closure.

With precip ending Sunday afternoon, districts and road crews typically have sufficient time to treat and plow before Monday morning. Therefore, a full snow-day closure looks unlikely, but not zero due to the near-freezing regime and the possibility of localized overperformance or refreeze. I set the closure probability at 10% (with a higher chance of a delay than a closure)."

Confidence is only moderate because we lack an explicit **Monday 2/23 hourly** forecast; the closure-critical window is pre-dawn through ~8 AM Monday, and the provided detailed hourly data is for Sunday 2/22."

The forecast provided is mainly for Sunday (2026-02-22): about ~1.2\" of snow with temps staying subfreezing and modest wind. That setup rarely forces a Monday full closure in West Michigan because crews have many hours to treat/plow. However, it *can* produce a meaningful patchy-ice problem on bridges, shaded curves, rural segments, and subdivision streets—exactly where buses operate—if Sunday’s slush compacts and refreezes overnight. That pushes me above the historical 8–12% baseline and into the high-teens for a full snow day. I’d put the “delay” probability notably higher than closure, but since you asked snow day (closure), I land at 18%."

Here, there’s no public-facing closure signal yet, and the forecasted snow is modest and occurs Sunday late morning through early afternoon, leaving substantial time for treatment/plowing before Monday, Feb 23 morning. That keeps full closure odds low. However, the road-commission pretreatment story is a meaningful ‘ice risk’ flag; in West Michigan, thin glaze + refreeze on secondary/bus-route roads can trigger delays/closures even when totals are small. Balancing those, I land slightly above the met/history baselines: about a 12% chance of a full snow day (with a higher chance of a delay than a closure, though not requested)."
