Patchy evening and nighttime fog or mist may briefly reduce visibility to around 1 mile after school, but this develops well after the morning commute and is not associated with accumulating snow or ice.

Historically, Michigan districts—including Rockford—almost never close for this type of ‘cloudy, breezy, near-freezing but dry’ pattern. Closures in this area and season typically require significant accumulating snow with poor timing, an ice storm, or extreme cold (wind chills below about -15°F), none of which are present. Thus, the historical analogs point to an effectively 0% closure rate under similar setups, and confidence in ‘no snow day’ from weather alone is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. AGREEMENTS ACROSS EXPERTS\n- Meteorologist: Explicitly forecasts NO snow or ice, 0\" accumulation, and no precip through the school day.\n- Historian: Finds multiple strong analogs with this same dry, near-freezing pattern and reports a 0% historical snow-day rate for such setups, with high confidence.\n- Safety Analyst: Rates road and travel conditions in the 7.5–9/10 range, notes only localized black-ice risk, and explicitly states conditions do not justify a snow day or delay.\n- News/Intel: Finds no closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, no active closings on TV stations, and no active winter alerts for Kent County; community signal leans toward normal operations.\n=> All four agree there is no storm, roads are broadly fine, and nothing closure-level is expected.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- The only minor tension is the safety analyst flagging “moderate” ice-formation risk while meteorology shows no precip. This is easily reconciled: with temps near 30–32°F and very high humidity, isolated black ice on bridges and shaded spots is possible even in dry patterns, but not at a scale that drives closures in Michigan. All experts still converge on normal operations.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Forecast snowfall: 0\". No accumulating snow event is expected, so plow timing is essentially irrelevant.\n- With no falling snow, there is no ‘snow end time’ to work backward from. Roads are expected to be dry or only locally damp/patchy.\n- Any road work is routine salting/spot checks, not full plow operations. Effective ‘clear roads’ exist well before the 7:40 AM bell.\n=> Plow timing presents no constraint on opening; it effectively supports a 0–5% closure probability.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Meteorology: 6 freezing-hours with temps around 27–30°F but no precipitation at any point; no freezing rain, drizzle, or snow.\n- Safety: Labels ice-formation risk as “moderate” specifically due to marginal temps and humidity, and appropriately recommends a 5:30–6:00 AM spot check of bridges and known trouble spots.\n- History: Notes that with no precip and daytime temps creeping above freezing, treated surfaces historically IMPROVE through the day.\n=> There is some non-zero chance of patchy black ice, but this is a routine Michigan winter hazard, not a system-wide closure trigger. It may justify cautious driving and a quick early-morning inspection, but not a snow day.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel confirms: no pre-announced closures for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, or Rockford itself.\n- FOX 17 closings page: no active school closings or delays for West Michigan related to this date.\n- No winter storm-level buzz or map of broad closures.\n=> The specific competition rule (+15–20% if 3+ neighboring districts close) clearly does NOT apply. If anything, the absence of any closures is further confirmation that this is a routine day.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nTo be wrong with a 1% forecast, one of the following would have to occur despite the current guidance:\n- An unforecast surprise event, e.g., a sudden lake-effect burst or freezing drizzle develops overnight and ices roads broadly; OR\n- A non-weather operational issue (major power outage, water main break, or unrelated emergency) prompts a closure unrelated to the forecast pattern; OR\n- A last-minute, ultra-cautious district decision based on isolated black-ice reports spreads across much of the region despite the dry forecast.\nAll of these are low-probability ‘tail’ events based on the available meteorology, history, safety assessment, and news intel.\n\n7. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Calls risk “effectively zero.” With no precip and temps near/above freezing, this justifies a base closure probability near 0–2%.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low risk, normal operations recommended. This supports staying at the low end (0–5%).\n- History (20% weight): Multiple high-confidence analogs with 0% closure rate; this strongly anchors the probability near 0–1%.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight): No current or neighboring closures, no alerts, and no community chatter about bad roads. This rules out any upward adjustment.\nCombining these, the rational calibrated value is a non-zero but extremely small probability. To avoid an unrealistically absolute 0% (given tail risks), I set the final probability at 1%.\n\n8. DECISION\nGiven:\n- No snow, no ice storm, no accumulating precip.\n- Only routine winter cold and wind.\n- Historically zero closure rate in similar patterns.\n- No neighboring closures or warning signals.\nThe prediction is that Rockford Public Schools will operate on a normal schedule on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.\n\nSnow day probability (closure or full remote day): 1%.\nConfidence Level: Very High.\n\nThis should yield a very strong Brier score if, as expected, school is open ( (0.01 − 0)² = 0.0001 ).",
