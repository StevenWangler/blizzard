Snow amounts are negligible (~0.04 in), so snow load/plowing is not the issue. The main concern is icing: the day-level forecast flags light freezing rain with a fairly high precip chance (73%), and with temps near 0°F to single digits in the morning any untreated surfaces can glaze quickly. Winds are light (max ~9 mph), so blowing/drifting snow is not expected; visibility impacts appear dataset-driven/patchy, but late evening has light/moderate snow with ~3 mi visibility. Net: low probability of a classic snow day from snowfall, but an elevated risk of slick roads/sidewalks from any freezing drizzle/freezing rain—ice is the factor that could trigger delays/closures if it materializes during the pre-dawn to early commute window."

However, The Weather Channel hourly forecast for Rockford, MI shows colder apparent temperatures, reaching roughly -25°F to -27°F around the pre-dawn to early-morning hours (about 05:00–07:00). Regional articles citing NWS Grand Rapids messaging also indicate wind chills potentially as low as ~-25°F in the area Friday morning. Because at least one major public-facing source (Weather.com) is below the -20°F threshold, the wind-chill-based closure trigger must be treated as met/possible for Friday morning conditions, even though the WeatherAPI feed is just above that cutoff.",

The main risks are (a) extreme cold and (b) patchy icing/black ice on secondary/local roads. Power outages are not currently widespread.\n2) Disagreements: The main conflict is wind chill magnitude (WeatherAPI ~-10 to -19°F vs Weather.com/NWS-referenced reporting ~-25°F) and how long the road hazard persists (not just when precip falls). Tools resolved this: Web verifier confirms Weather.com shows ~-25 to -26°F 5–8 AM; safety clarifies hazard window extends through the morning due to persistent cold.\n3) Plow timing math: This is not about “hours from snow end” because there’s little snow to plow; it’s about whether a thin glaze forms and then persists. Infrastructure + safety indicate main routes should be serviceable by ~6:30 AM, but residential/local streets remain the most variable through ~9 AM, and salt is less effective.\n4) Any ice? Yes—freezing drizzle/freezing rain signal plus high ice-formation risk; even tiny amounts can create unpredictable slick patches.\n5) Neighboring districts? News intel found no confirmed Fri 01/30 closures/delays in nearby districts at the time checked (no +15–20% bump).\n6) Power outage concerns? No evidence of a widespread outage event (very low statewide outages). No adjustment beyond baseline.\n7) Wind chill threshold verification? Yes—Weather.com indicates ≤ -20°F is likely, not marginal, during bus-stop hours; that elevates risk meaningfully.\n8) What would make me wrong? (a) If actual wind chills are closer to WeatherAPI (>-20°F) and roads are largely dry/treated, school likely opens normally → I’d be overestimating closure risk. (b) If even a trace glaze becomes widespread on neighborhood/bus-route roads or Rockford applies a strict cold policy at ≤ -20°F, a delay/closure becomes much more likely → I’d be underestimating.\n\nWeighting per directive: Meteorology (25%) + Safety (25%) drive the core call; history (15%) pulls probability down because trace-precip days usually stay open; news (15%) keeps it from jumping because no neighboring closures are confirmed; infrastructure (10%) supports “serviceable but variable”; power (5%) is neutral; web verifier (5%) pushes up due to wind-chill trigger. Net: I move above the agents’ ~21% average because the wind-chill trigger appears met and the safety window is longer than the initial 00:00–01:00 framing. Still, lack of confirmed neighboring closures and minimal precip keeps it below 50%.\n\nBottom line: higher-than-normal chance of disruption, with delay more likely than full closure; I set full-closure (“snow day”) probability at 38%.",

With essentially negligible new snow and light winds, widespread travel disruption is unlikely. However, a light freezing-rain/freezing-drizzle signal during the overnight/early-morning window combined with very cold pavement temperatures can still yield dangerous patchy black ice. The biggest swing factor is the *wind chill* discrepancy: if the colder (-25°F to -27°F) pre-dawn wind chills verify and the district uses a strict wind-chill threshold, closure/delay odds rise. Netting these together, I land in the “low but not trivial” range: about a ~22% chance of a snow day (closure), with a higher chance of a 1–2 hour delay than a full closure.",

With essentially negligible new snow and light winds, widespread travel disruption is unlikely. However, a light freezing-rain/freezing-drizzle signal during the overnight/early-morning window combined with very cold pavement temperatures can still yield dangerous patchy black ice. The biggest swing factor is the *wind chill* discrepancy: if the colder (-25°F to -27°F) pre-dawn wind chills verify and the district uses a strict wind-chill threshold, closure/delay odds rise. Netting these together, I land in the “low but not trivial” range: about a ~22% chance of a snow day (closure), with a higher chance of a 1–2 hour delay than a full closure."

Snow accumulation is negligible and winds are light, so widespread impassability is unlikely. However, the combination of (1) any freezing-rain residue, even at ~0.01\" liquid, (2) persistent subfreezing temps that prevent improvement, (3) reduced salt effectiveness in near/ below-zero temps, and (4) possible wind chills in the -25°F range around bus-stop time creates a realistic (but not dominant) pathway to a delay or closure. I land at ~22% for a full snow day/closure; I’d rate delay probability higher than closure, but since you asked snow day probability, I’m keeping it in the low-20s rather than teens."

There’s no explicit Rockford announcement yet, and snowfall is not the driver. The credible “closure outlook” (15–30%) and official road-commission emphasis on traction measures during extreme cold argue for a meaningful risk of at least a delay if black ice is reported on bus routes early Friday. I’m setting 22% to reflect: (a) the local outlook’s range, (b) low snowfall totals, and (c) the fact that many Michigan districts operate through cold unless wind-chill thresholds are clearly exceeded or ice is widespread."

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 418 PM EST, an ice jam continues to be reported by local\nauthorities on the Muskegon river in southern Newaygo County.\nThe river gauge at Newaygo shows water levels remaining at\nminor flood stage as of Wednesday afternoon.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
