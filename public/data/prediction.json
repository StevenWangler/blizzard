However, web cross-checking found conflicting public-facing values: one Weather.com hourly page for Rockford, MI 49341 shows much colder 'Feels Like' values around -23°F to -24°F for overnight hours (below the -20°F threshold), while another Weather.com listing shows more moderate 'Feels Like' values (roughly mid-teens below zero at worst). Because at least one major consumer source displays sub -20°F wind chills, the automatic-closure consideration threshold is triggered on the web side, but this is not supported by your API payload. This indicates either (a) a location/identity mismatch across 'Rockford' pages, (b) timing mismatch, or (c) rapidly updated model differences. Snowfall in your API is light (~0.45 inches total), and the bigger operational risk appears to be cold wind chills and potentially reduced visibility during snow showers rather than heavy accumulation.",

They also agree a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The only major conflict was wind chill (Weather.com showed <= -20°F earlier). Web verifier resolved this: official NWS point forecast for Rockford MI indicates wind chills around ~-8°F overnight and ~-2°F Tuesday (commute window not near -20°F). So the automatic cold-closure trigger is NOT supported.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow/mix ends ~6:30; that’s essentially 0–1 hour before buses. Highways/arterials get continuous cycles, but neighborhood streets and rural bus-route connectors often won’t be “good” until after a daylight pass (~8:30–10:30). That timing supports delay risk but not a strong full-closure signal.\n4) Ice: Present as a risk, but likely *trace-to-spotty* (meteorologist notes extremely small QPF during freezing-rain hours). Enough for isolated slickness; not a widespread glaze event.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Tue closures/delays for Rockford or key neighbors; closings pages show minimal activity → no domino boost.\n6) Power: Kent County outages extremely low (~12 customers). No evidence of a broader outage event → no power-based bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS confirms not <= -20°F for Rockford → no near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make me wrong: If freezing drizzle/freezing rain is more efficient than forecast and creates widespread black ice (especially around 5:30–7:00 AM) OR if an early-morning crash cluster/road incident pattern emerges OR a localized power/heat outage affects multiple buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) all point to low closure odds because totals are small and improvements occur after daybreak; Safety/Infrastructure highlight commute timing and secondary-road traction as the main issue. News (15%) provides no confirmed closure momentum. Infrastructure (10%) suggests arterials OK but neighborhoods/rural still slick. Power (10%) low outages. Web verifier (5%) removes the -20°F trigger. Net result: a closure is possible but not likely; I land on ~20% for a full snow day closure (with higher probability for a 2-hour delay than for a closure).",

With only ~0.45\" snow forecast and winds below major blowing/drifting thresholds, I can’t justify a high closure probability. I am, however, above a ‘baseline nuisance snow day’ because the freezing-rain windows (especially near ~06:00) are timed right at bus rollout/early commute and could create patchy black ice that forces a conservative call.\n\nSo I land at ~22% for a full snow day (closure).

Historically, *thin glaze at the wrong time* is more likely to produce a **delay** than a full closure unless it becomes widespread/confirmed on roads.",
              "**Cold/wind chill is near (not beyond) common closure triggers:** The provided WeatherAPI-style values suggest wind chills roughly in the -5°F to -15°F neighborhood around the morning window—this is uncomfortable and can drive operational caution, but historically many districts don’t close purely for that unless it’s more like ≤ -15°F widespread/prolonged (especially closer to -20°F).",
              "**Local variability (lake-effect / microclimate):** Rockford can be on the edge of sharper gradients; if a band sets up over bus-route corridors, localized whiteout/slick travel can outpace the “total accumulation” number.

That said, totals and wind aren’t at classic closure thresholds for West Michigan, and conditions appear to improve after sunrise. This pattern more often yields a DELAY than a full cancellation, unless icing verifies as widespread (not just patchy). I therefore place full snow-day probability in the high-teens, with the caveat that verification of glazing/crash clusters could push this up quickly overnight/early morning.",
            "keyFactors": [

For Tuesday, Jan 27, 2026 in Rockford, the weather looks like a high-friction *morning* (possible patchy glaze + very cold wind chills), but not a classic ‘close everything’ setup given low snow totals and modest winds. With no confirmed district announcements yet and no outage-driven narrative, I’m at a low-to-low-moderate closure probability, with the main upside risk being if the freezing-rain window verifies worse than expected right before buses roll.",

I am, however, above a ‘baseline nuisance snow day’ because the freezing-rain windows (especially near ~06:00) are timed right at bus rollout/early commute and could create patchy black ice that forces a conservative call.\n\nSo I land at ~22% for a full snow day (closure).

I’m landing at **18%** for a full snow day (closure), with the stronger outcome being **normal operations or a delay** if icing verifies on untreated roads/bridges."

That said, totals and wind aren’t at classic closure thresholds for West Michigan, and conditions appear to improve after sunrise. This pattern more often yields a DELAY than a full cancellation, unless icing verifies as widespread (not just patchy). I therefore place full snow-day probability in the high-teens, with the caveat that verification of glazing/crash clusters could push this up quickly overnight/early morning."

For Tuesday, Jan 27, 2026 in Rockford, the weather looks like a high-friction *morning* (possible patchy glaze + very cold wind chills), but not a classic ‘close everything’ setup given low snow totals and modest winds. With no confirmed district announcements yet and no outage-driven narrative, I’m at a low-to-low-moderate closure probability, with the main upside risk being if the freezing-rain window verifies worse than expected right before buses roll."
