    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Friday 2025-12-26, temperatures stay near 30–32°F all day with 24+ hours at or below freezing. From the school-operations perspective, the overnight period (midnight–7 AM) is dry but cold and windy; no accumulating snow or ice is falling during typical bus times, so road crews have a clean window. Snow begins after the normal start of the school day: moderate to heavy snow showers develop 9–11 AM with about 1.1\" total daytime accumulation and visibility briefly down to ~1 mile. Around late morning to midday, thermal profiles support a transition to moderate or heavy freezing rain from roughly 11 AM–1 PM while temps hover 31–32°F, producing a potentially hazardous glaze on untreated roads, sidewalks, and parking lots. Winds from the E/ESE 15–20 mph (gusts near 25–40 mph early) will enhance wind chill but are below damaging thresholds. In a Michigan context, ~1\" of snow alone would not justify a closure, but the timing and presence of freezing rain during the late morning/midday hours is the key concern. Because there is no overnight snow/ice and plows have clear roads by early morning, the risk of a full-morning snow day *before* school starts is low. The more likely operational impact is on **midday/afternoon travel and events** (early dismissals, activity cancellations) if the freezing rain verifies. Overall: low probability of a traditional morning snow day closure, but a moderate to high risk of very slick conditions developing late morning through afternoon due to freezing rain on top of cold pavement."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided hourly forecast for Friday, 2025‑12‑26, Rockford is expected to see:\n- Temperatures largely 28–32°F all day.\n- Winds 15–20 mph with gusts up to ~40 mph in the morning.\n- Precipitation beginning as moderate to heavy snow around 09:00–10:00, producing roughly 2–3 cm (about 1 inch) of snow by late morning, then transitioning to moderate/freezing rain 11:00–13:00, tapering to lighter overcast conditions for the afternoon commute.\n- Total liquid precipitation around 0.37\" with about 2.8 cm (~1.1\") of snow, implying more mixed precipitation and ice than deep snow.\n\nWhen compared with historical patterns for Kent County and similar West Michigan districts, conditions like this (1–3\" of snow, some morning icing, gusty but non‑blizzard winds, wind chills mostly in the teens) have only occasionally led to school closures by themselves. Closures are more common when:\n- Blizzard criteria or near‑whiteout conditions occur for several hours, or\n- Ice storms create widespread glazing and power issues, or\n- Snowfall totals exceed about 8–10\" with poor timing (e.g., starting before first buses and continuing through the morning).\n\nThis forecast shows:\n- No extreme cold (wind chills are around 15–25°F, far above the ~‑15°F threshold that historically triggers cold‑related closures).\n- Snow totals well below usual closure thresholds, and the heaviest snow/ice appears to peak late morning rather than before the first buses.\n- Some potential for slick conditions, especially if freezing rain verifies more than modeled or arrives earlier.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter driving and Rockford’s experience with managing these moderate events, the historical analogs suggest a relatively low probability that these specific conditions alone would produce a snow day for Friday, 2025‑12‑26. The main wildcard is how much ice actually accretes and whether timing shifts earlier into the 05:00–07:00 bus window, but based strictly on the forecast pattern and past behavior, this setup more often results in:\n- School operating as normal or with cautionary messaging, possibly with some localized delays or minor issues on untreated back roads,\n- Rather than a district‑wide cancellation.\n\nOverall, confidence in the historical context and its application to this forecast is medium‑to‑high: the pattern is fairly typical for late December in West Michigan and does not currently resemble the higher‑impact snow or ice events that have driven widespread closures in the past."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- All four streams agree the *overnight through early-morning commute (before ~8 AM)* is dry but cold, with roads largely clear for plows and traffic.\n- They agree on **low snow totals (~1.1\")**, with the main hazard being a **late-morning to early-afternoon transition to freezing rain (11 AM–1 PM)** creating slick conditions.\n- They concur this is *not* a high-end snowstorm (no blizzard conditions, no extreme cold) but does pose **moderate travel risk** once freezing rain develops.\n- News intel and historian both emphasize that Rockford and neighboring districts are **already on Winter Break**; closures on Dec. 26 are calendar-based, not weather-based.\n\n2. Disagreements / nuances:\n- Meteorologist: explicitly notes a **low probability of a traditional morning snow day closure**; sees the primary risk as late-morning/afternoon travel and activities.\n- Safety analyst: labels risk as **moderate** overall, highlighting **significant afternoon impact** but only **moderate morning commute impact**.\n- Historian: similar mixed-precip patterns show **~25–30% snow-day rates**, but that’s for days when school is actually in session and when icing occasionally reaches higher impact.\n- News intel: clarifies that **no actual snow-day decision exists** because school is closed for break; that effectively dominates the operational outcome.\n\nThere is no substantive conflict about the *weather*: the differences are in how impactful the event would be **if school were in session**. In reality, the NEWS intelligence makes clear the key operational fact: **no classes that day**.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Snow and mixed precip begin around **09:00**.\n- Standard high-school start/reference time: **~07:40 AM**.\n- End of meaningful freezing-rain threat: **~13:00**.\n- From the **end of snow/ice to 07:40 AM**, for this specific calendar day, is not relevant because the event is *after* the typical start time. If school *were* in session, plow crews would actually have a **clean, dry overnight window (midnight–7 AM)** to fully prep roads before any precip starts.\n\n4. Ice presence:\n- Yes, **freezing rain is explicitly forecast** 11:00–13:00 with temps 30–32°F and a high risk of glazing on untreated surfaces.\n- This *would* be a serious concern for midday travel and could justify early dismissals or activity cancellations if school were in session.\n- However, it does **not** coincide with the early-morning bus window, which is the main driver of a classic snow day.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel reports that **Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and other Kent ISD districts** are also on **winter break**; any closures are **calendar-driven**.\n- There are **no weather-based closure chains** or domino effects to factor in; thus, no +15–20% bump from neighboring districts is appropriate.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- The only realistic way to be wrong on a *snow day* probability here would be if the **calendar information were incorrect** (i.e., school unexpectedly in session) or if a district opted to brand some weather-related action (like cancelling a camp or optional program) as a full ‘closure.’\n- All provided official sources, however, consistently show **Winter Break Dec. 22–Jan. 2** with no classes Dec. 26. The probability of a true instructional-day snow day is therefore effectively tied to a calendar reversal, which is extremely unlikely.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates **low morning hazard, higher late-morning/afternoon hazard**, and only ~1.1\" snow with mixed freezing rain. On weather alone, this supports a **low–moderate** snow-day risk if school were open, mainly because of the ice.\n- Safety (25%): Rates overall risk as **moderate**, but emphasizes that **core 6–8 AM commute is mainly dry**, with worst travel 09:00–13:00. That again suggests **not a classic morning closure**, more of a midday concern.\n- History (20%): Analog events show ~25–30% closure rates **when school is in session** and when icing sometimes lines up with commute windows. Given the later timing here and Michigan’s higher thresholds, that historical signal is **on the low side** of closure probability.\n- News Intelligence (20% – ‘secret weapon’): Provides the decisive context: **Rockford Public Schools is closed for Winter Break; no instructional day exists to cancel.** Neighboring districts are also on break. This essentially collapses the actual, realized snow-day probability for Dec. 26, 2025, toward 0–5%, regardless of the marginal meteorological case for closures on a normal school day.\n\nSYNTHESIS INTO A PROBABILITY\n- If this were a normal school day:\n  - 1.1\" of snow + mid/late-morning freezing rain with high ice risk would put the **base closure probability** roughly in the **20–30%** range given Michigan thresholds (low snow amount, but presence of ice and tricky midday timing).\n- However, because **school is already out for Winter Break**, the operational question “Will there be a snow day?” translates to: “Will the district declare a weather-related school closure on a day where no school is scheduled?” Historically and practically, that is almost never done.\n\nGiven that:\n- Calendar certainty is high (official website, multiple posts, regional practice),\n- Neighboring districts are also on break (no chain-reaction effect),\n- No indication of an emergency-level storm (blizzard/ice storm with infrastructure failure),\n\nI assign a **5% snow day probability**. This is not 0% only to allow for highly unusual administrative labeling (e.g., if the district bizarrely issued a ‘closure’ notice despite break), but such a scenario is extremely unlikely.\n\nConfidence is **high** because the key determinant (the calendar) is clear and corroborated, and all weather experts broadly agree on timing and magnitude of the event.\n\nIn summary: Weather may cause **hazardous midday travel**, but it will almost certainly **not** result in a formal snow day for Rockford, since school is already closed for Winter Break.",
