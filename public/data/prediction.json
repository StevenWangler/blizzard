Wind chills are well above the ≤-20°F automatic-closure threshold. With visibility ~6 miles and no active snow or ice expected during the 6–8 AM window, this is a typical Michigan winter morning that districts can operate through. Snow-day risk Monday should be low, with the main caveat being leftover slick spots from Sunday’s light snow/freezing drizzle—especially on untreated neighborhood roads and sidewalks.

The main historical ‘gotcha’ is leftover slick spots/refreeze from Sunday’s light freezing rain/light snow and reported slippery roads. If Sunday evening roads get fully treated and temps stay steady below freezing (not a melt-then-flash-freeze), closure odds stay near the low end (~5–12%). If there’s documented freezing rain glaze or widespread untreated backroads overnight, odds can jump into the teens/low-20s. Net call from these inputs: about a 10–15% chance of a closure, with a higher chance of minor delays than a full snow day."

Safety/infrastructure concerns center on residual slick spots from Sunday’s light snow/freezing-rain signals and an overnight refreeze, which can create patchy black ice—especially on bridges, shaded stretches, and lower-priority neighborhood/rural roads. However, with ~21 hours between Sunday’s precip tapering and Monday bus time, and with normal plow/salt resources, Rockford can usually operate (possibly with spot-treatment and route checks). News intel did not confirm Rockford or neighboring-district closures from official sources in this environment (and absence of a notice is only a mild ‘open’ signal).

The only meaningful pathway to a closure is if Sunday’s wintry mix/snow leaves widespread untreated packed snow or glaze that refreezes overnight—especially on rural/secondary routes and bridge decks—creating enough hazardous travel for the morning commute.

The only meaningful pathway to a closure is if Sunday’s wintry mix leaves enough glaze/packed snow on secondary roads that an overnight refreeze makes AM travel broadly hazardous—more common on rural connectors, bridges, shaded valley spots—yet that typically results in heightened caution or occasional delays rather than a full district closure.

That pushes me toward a low closure probability.\n\nI’m keeping the estimate above “very low” because today (Sun 2026-02-22) includes wintry mix signals (freezing rain/light snow) plus an NWS Special Weather Statement explicitly citing slippery/possibly ice-covered pavement, which creates a credible Monday-morning black-ice tail risk—especially on bridges/overpasses and on lower-priority neighborhood/rural roads that may not be fully treated Sunday night. If early-morning route checks find widespread glaze/compacted snow on secondary roads, a delay (or selective cancellations) becomes more plausible than a full district-wide snow day.\n\nNet: closure more likely than not? No. But not negligible due to refreeze uncertainty and “weekend storm cleanup” variability across the district’s bus routes."

Balancing that against the dry Monday forecast and the lack of an RPS notice, I land in the low-teens for a full closure (with delays more plausible than a full cancel)."
