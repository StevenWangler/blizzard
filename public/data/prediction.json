Roads may still be snow-covered or slick from the weekend event, but with light winds (~5–8 mph) and no new significant snow or ice, road crews should have ample time to clean up. A brief period of heavier snow redevelops around 9–11 PM Monday with about a quarter inch of accumulation, well after the school day. Given Michigan’s high snow tolerance and the lack of active heavy snow or ice during the Monday morning commute, the meteorological likelihood of a full snow day on Monday is low; delays are more plausible than closures, driven by residual snowpack rather than Monday’s weather itself."

The heaviest snow and the active Winter Storm Warning are focused on Saturday through Sunday morning, with Rockford’s Monday featuring cold (teens to upper 20s°F) but not extreme temperatures, light winds, and only around a quarter-inch of additional snow and brief heavier bursts late evening. Historically, Michigan schools in this area have remained open in similar post-storm, cold-but-manageable situations as long as primary and most secondary roads are cleared by early morning. Therefore, the historical pattern comparison suggests a relatively low-to-moderate probability of a snow day on Monday itself (roughly in the 10–30% range), with the main closure risk tied to localized plowing/back-road issues rather than Monday’s actual weather conditions."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreements\n- Meteorologist: The impactful snow ends Sunday; Monday morning is cold, mainly dry, with only a trace (~0.25\") of new snow and no heavy bands during the 4–8 AM commute. Likelihood of a full snow day is described as low.\n- Historian: In very similar ‘post‑storm, quiet Monday’ situations, West Michigan districts usually hold school. Historical snow day rates are ~25–30% when a weekend warning ends 12–24 hours before school and only 10% when there is no active storm, ice, or brutal wind chill at start time.\n- Safety analyst: Worst driving conditions are Saturday evening through Sunday midday. By Monday morning, road impact is ‘minimal’ with good visibility and treated roads. Bus and parent traffic are described as feasible with standard winter caution.\n- News intel: Rockford and nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) show no closure/delay postings for Monday; sites appear in normal-operation mode, with only generic inclement-weather policy notes.\n\nAll four agree this is a classic Michigan scenario: big weekend storm, then a cold but manageable Monday with cleanup time and no active hazard during the commute.\n\n2. Any disagreements?\n- Meteorology, history, and safety are aligned: low closure risk, perhaps low double‑digits at most.\n- News intelligence shows community sentiment as ‘uncertain’ but not strongly pushing for a closure; there are also no early closure rumors or neighboring districts closing.\nThere is no substantive conflict among the experts; the differences are about emphasis (how routine this feels), not direction.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n- Worst storm conditions: Sat 11/29 18:00 to Sun 11/30 12:00 (safety tool).\n- After 12:00 Sunday, conditions improve, with the main accumulating snow done by late Sunday morning.\n- Monday 4–8 AM commute occurs roughly 18–20 hours after heavy snow ends.\n- Meteorology explicitly notes: ‘no accumulating snow is falling during the 4–8 AM plow window’ and crews ‘should have ample time to clean up.’\nGiven Michigan’s practiced plow operations and 18+ hours of lead time, this strongly favors roads being in at least acceptable condition for school.\n\n4. Ice risk\n- Forecast precip type is snow only, with no freezing rain signal.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing, so any water is frozen, but that means patchy slick spots rather than an ice storm. The safety assessment flags ‘moderate’ ice-formation risk only on untreated surfaces, not systemic glazing of the network.\n- Windchills are near 0°F, not at the -15°F or colder threshold that often drives cold-related closures in Michigan.\nThis is ordinary post‑storm winter cold, not an ice event.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel finds **no** neighboring district closures or announced delays for Monday (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD). That leaves the ‘neighboring district’ snow-day bump at 0%; we do not apply the +15–20% adjustment.\n- Rockford’s own site explicitly says ‘return to classrooms on Monday, December 1’ with no weather caveat or banner.\n- Social/media sentiment is labeled ‘uncertain’ rather than strongly expecting a shutdown; there is no visible groundswell for closure.\nPer your rules, absent strong community ‘we’re definitely closing’ chatter or confirmed nearby closures, we do not add any of the news-intel bonus.\n\n6. Base probability and weighting\nUsing your Michigan thresholds and the weighting scheme (Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News 20%):\n- Snow amounts: The warning storm totals (6–10\"+) occurred over the weekend, not during school hours. For Monday itself, forecast new snow is only ~0.25\". That places the **Monday** event well below the <4\" category, which normally corresponds to a 5–15% snow-day range in Michigan when timing is not bad.\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly suggests school will be in session; I infer about a 10–15% closure likelihood from their language (‘low’, ‘delays more plausible than closures’).\n- Safety (25% weight): Describes Monday conditions as manageable with only isolated slick spots; again roughly a ~10–20% closure risk, mainly for outlying roads if cleanup underperforms.\n- History (20% weight): Directly pegs similar patterns at 10–30%, with additional seasonal context that Michigan districts generally open in this setup. With the storm ending a full day before, the lower half of that range (around 15–20%) is most appropriate.\n- News intel (20% weight): Shows no proactive closure moves or neighboring shutdowns, which supports staying near the lower edge of plausible probabilities rather than the upper edge.\n\nBlending these, I anchor at about 12–15% based on weather/safety/history, then give a slight upward nudge (to 18%) for the fact this is a high‑end early‑season storm with potentially rutted rural roads and some uncertainty about how fully side roads will be cleared.\n\nThis 18% figure:\n- Respects Michigan’s higher tolerance (far below the 35–50% that would require a well‑timed 6–8\" Monday event, and far below the 60%+ reserved for 8\"+ or ice **during** the commute).\n- Keeps us out of your discouraged 40–60% zone because the expert consensus is not genuinely conflicted; they are clearly leaning ‘school as usual.’\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes would be operational, not meteorological:\n- Plow/cleanup underperforms: If Sunday daytime/evening cleanup lags badly, leaving many hilly rural routes, side streets, and bus turnarounds deeply rutted or glazed, Rockford could call a closure or 2‑hour delay despite benign Monday weather. That’s a low‑probability but real risk.\n- Surprise ice or refreeze issues: If a subtle drizzle, compaction, or melt/refreeze cycle creates more widespread black ice on hills and back roads than forecast, safety concerns could push administrators to close.\n- Late‑breaking regional decisions: If 3+ neighboring districts unexpectedly announce closures or multiple districts announce widespread delays late Sunday night/early Monday, Rockford might follow for consistency.\nGiven current data (no ice signal, 18–24 hours of cleanup, no neighboring moves yet), these remain secondary scenarios rather than the base case.\n\nThus, a snow day on Monday, Dec 1 in Rockford, MI is **unlikely but not impossible**, with an estimated probability of about 18% and a higher likelihood of a normal school day or, at most, a minor delay.",
