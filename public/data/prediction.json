    "overall_conditions_summary": "A significant winter storm is expected in the Rockford, MI area from Saturday morning Nov 29 through Sunday morning Nov 30, with model guidance and the NWS Winter Storm Watch supporting roughly 6–10 inches of total snowfall in Kent County. Forecast hourly data for Saturday and Sunday show repeated periods of heavy snow with 0.5–1\"/hr rates, low visibilities near 1 mile or less at times, and winds frequently 15–20 mph out of the SE then NW, which will create some drifting and localized blowing snow. Temperatures stay mainly in the 20s to around 32°F through Sunday, so everything that falls will stick, and road surfaces will become snow- and ice-covered, especially on untreated secondary and rural roads. By the target school day, Monday Dec 1, the main storm has ended late Sunday night, but guidance still shows subfreezing temps (upper teens to 20s) Sunday night with renewed heavy snow around or after 11 PM and continuing into at least the early overnight. This will likely leave a fresh 1–3\" on top of an already deep snowpack right before the morning commute. Plow crews will be working continuously, but county and subdivision roads may still be snow-packed or rutted by early Monday, and lingering gusty northwest winds will maintain wind chills in the teens, with areas of drifting. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for snow, the raw snow totals alone might not force a closure, but the combination of: (1) a weekend-long storm producing 6–10\"+, (2) fresh accumulating snow very late Sunday night into early Monday, (3) temperatures staying below freezing preventing melt, and (4) NWS messaging about potentially very difficult travel, all point to a meaningful disruption risk. Overall, the Monday Dec 1 outcome in Rockford is likely to be either a 2-hour delay or selective closures depending on final storm track; an outright full-system snow day is possible but not guaranteed. From a probabilistic standpoint, the risk of at least a delay is moderate to high, while the risk of a full-day closure is in the low-to-moderate range, contingent on how much snow is still falling or freshly fallen between about 2–6 AM Monday."

        "Rockford tends to follow broader Kent County decisions; if the storm’s worst travel impacts were Saturday–Sunday and interstates/arterials are in good shape by Sunday night, they often open on time or at most call a 2‑hour delay when sidewalks and back roads are marginal."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s slightly higher elevation relative to downtown Grand Rapids can add minor enhancement to snow totals (often an extra 1–2\" in strong events) and slightly cooler overnight lows, which can encourage refreeze and patchy black ice on untreated neighborhood roads, but this alone rarely triggers closures without concurrent high winds or ongoing heavy snow."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, the core of this winter storm hits Rockford from early Saturday (2025‑11‑29) through at least Sunday morning (2025‑11‑30), with heavy snow during multiple periods and storm‑total guidance in the 8–11\"+ range for the watch area. For Rockford itself, your hourly grid suggests roughly 5–6\" on Saturday and another ~6\"+ on Sunday, plus the potential for additional wrap‑around or lake‑effect later Sunday into Sunday night.\n\nMichigan context: districts here rarely close for amount alone. Historical practice in Kent County and similar West Michigan districts indicates that:\n- 6–10\" spread over 24–36 hours on a weekend, with snow largely tapering by Sunday midday/afternoon, usually results in **school opening on time Monday**, provided no major icing, no blizzard‑level winds, and successful plowing of main and most secondary roads.\n- Closures become more common when: (1) heavy snow continues into the 3–7 AM window on the school day, (2) strong winds cause drifting/near‑whiteout conditions, or (3) freezing rain/ice significantly degrades road surface conditions.\n\nFrom the data you supplied:\n- Temperatures during and after the storm hover in the 20s°F to near 32°F, with wind chills mostly between about 14–20°F—**not** near the extreme cold threshold (<‑15°F wind chill) that sometimes leads to closures by itself.\n- Winds top out around 15–17 mph with higher gusts Sunday afternoon/evening, which is breezy but short of classic blizzard criteria.\n- The watch emphasizes difficult to potentially impossible travel mainly **Saturday into Sunday morning**. By Sunday late morning and afternoon, your forecast trends toward lighter snow and then partial clearing, with strong northwest winds helping to dry some treated pavements even as windchill stays low.\n\nGiven those factors and typical Rockford/Kent County decision patterns, the **most historically consistent outcome** for Monday, 2025‑12‑01, is:\n- **Moderate chance of a regular school day or at most a short delay**, assuming the storm behaves close to the current forecast—i.e., heaviest snow Saturday to early Sunday, no major freezing‑rain episode Sunday night, and only scattered/light snow or flurries lingering into early Monday.\n- **Lower, but non‑zero, chance of a full snow day** if a heavier‑than‑forecast band persists or redevelops into the pre‑dawn hours Monday, or if cleanup is hampered by localized drifting and persistent low visibility on key bus routes.\n\nIn historical terms for this area and time of year, a late‑November weekend storm with 8–12\" total and improving conditions by Sunday night tends to close school on Monday **only when** the system is slower or stronger than expected. With the forecast you provided, the pattern currently aligns more with significant weekend disruption and messy but manageable Monday morning travel rather than a high‑likelihood snow day. Overall confidence in this historical‑pattern assessment is **medium**, because relatively small timing changes in Sunday‑night/Monday‑morning bands can meaningfully swing local school decisions."

    "decision_rationale": "Using Michigan‑specific closure behavior and the provided expert inputs, an 8–10\" weekend storm with sub‑freezing temps and some fresh late‑night snow pushes risk up but does not typically cross the high‑probability closure threshold here.\n\nMeteorology: Forecast shows roughly 8\"+ of snow overall, with a Winter Storm Watch and some heavy bands, but peak rates near 1\"/hr and winds around 15–20 mph keep conditions below classic blizzard/near‑whiteout standards. Critical for schools, the worst travel appears focused Saturday evening through late Sunday morning. By Sunday afternoon/evening, intensity eases, though another 1–3\" could fall late Sunday night, creating slick roads and fresh cover before bus time.\n\nHistory: For Rockford/Kent County, 6–10\" events concentrated over a weekend, with improving but still wintry conditions by Sunday night, usually do *not* trigger widespread Monday closures. The historical snow‑day rates for similar patterns cluster around 30–50% when some snow lingers into Monday, but closer to 30% when the main storm is done and cleanup time is adequate. Here, the overlap into Monday appears moderate, not extreme.\n\nSafety: The transportation/safety analysis labels overall risk as moderate. Primary roads are expected to be plowed but slick; secondary roads, parking lots, and walking routes are more marginal due to refreeze and compacted snow. That profile aligns with districts opting for normal start or a 2‑hour delay more often than a full closure.\n\nBalancing these, a full snow day is meaningfully possible—especially if a stronger‑than‑forecast band persists toward 3–6 AM Monday or cleanup lags on rural routes—but the base case is that Rockford runs school, perhaps with a delay. To be decisive and avoid an overly neutral 40–60% band, the final probability for a *full‑day* closure is set at 32%, implying roughly a 68% chance of no full snow day (on‑time or delayed start).",
