    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan, leading into the school day Monday, January 12, 2026, the key setup is a dry but cold-and-breezy regime on Sunday, January 11, with no new snow or ice.\n\n• Temperatures: Sunday runs in the upper 20s to around 30°F all day and into Sunday night, staying below freezing essentially 24 hours. That means any existing slush or wet spots from the preceding system will be frozen solid by Monday morning, but there is no warm nose or refreeze cycle that would create fresh glare ice from new precipitation.\n\n• Precipitation: Forecast totals for January 11 show 0.00\" liquid and 0.0 cm snow, and every hourly period has 0 precip. So there is no accumulating snow, no mixed precip, and no freezing rain in the 12–18 hours leading up to a typical Monday morning commute.\n\n• Wind: Northwest/WSW winds 15–20 mph with gusts in the mid 20s mph range persist through Sunday, producing wind chills in the mid teens (around 10–20°F). These winds are brisk but well below advisory-level by Sunday night and are typical for West Michigan. They may cause some localized blowing of any existing light, dry snowpack, but with no new snow falling and gusts mostly under 30 mph, visibility and drifting issues should be minor.\n\n• Visibility: The model output has some zeros that are clearly artifacts; the daily average visibility is about 2 miles with many hours at 6–10 miles. Overcast/low cloud and occasional shallow blowing snow could reduce visibility at times, but there is no dense fog, no heavy snow, and no true whiteout signal.\n\nMichigan Snow Day Context: Districts in Kent County routinely handle several inches of snow, and closures are usually driven by heavy overnight snow, significant drifting, or ice. Here, snow associated with the Saturday system is wrapping up well before Sunday night, and Sunday itself is dry. With no snow or ice falling overnight into Monday and roads having many daylight hours on Sunday to be plowed and treated, infrastructure will be well-prepared.\n\nBottom line for Monday, January 12, 2026: Expect cold, dry, breezy conditions with solidly frozen but largely treated roads and no fresh accumulation. The meteorological risk for a weather-related school closure or delay is very low. From a pure weather standpoint, this setup strongly favors school being open on time."

True closure‑level events in this area and timeframe historically involve either: (1) significant overnight/early‑morning snowfall totals (often 8–10\"+ with poor timing), (2) blizzard or near‑blizzard conditions with whiteouts and drifting, or (3) dangerous arctic outbreaks with wind chills colder than about −15°F to −20°F at bus time.",

      "elevation_impact": "Slight local elevation and open country north/east of Grand Rapids can modestly lower wind chills and allow for patchy drifting in big storms, but under this forecast (no fresh snow, winds mainly under 30 mph by Sunday night) elevation effects are minor and not typically closure‑driving."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast, Monday 2026-01-12 follows a pattern that in past years around Rockford, Michigan almost never produces snow days: there is no forecast snow for Sunday 2026-01-11 (totalprecip_mm = 0, totalsnow_cm = 0), temperatures hover near 30°F with wind chills in the teens (well above common extreme‑cold closure thresholds like −15°F wind chill), and visibility improves after Saturday’s light/moderate snow. Historical closure triggers in this region—8–10\"+ of poorly timed snow, active blizzard/whiteout conditions, major icing, or dangerous arctic air—are absent. While Saturday’s system and earlier high winds could leave some residual slick spots, they are typically manageable with normal winter operations by Monday. Overall, the historical analogs and local standards strongly suggest a very low probability of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools on Monday 2026-01-12 under this forecast scenario."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement checklist\n• Meteorologist: No new snow or precip Sunday into Monday; cold, breezy, but routine winter conditions. Explicit statement that meteorological risk for closure is very low and school should be open on time.\n• Historian: Very similar past patterns around Rockford almost never produce snow days. Analog snow‑day rate ~2–5% with this setup and local standards. Notes that true closure events require 8\"+ snow, blizzard/whiteout, significant ice, or dangerous arctic cold – none present.\n• Safety analyst: Rates road and travel conditions as good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, lots 8/10); morning and afternoon commute impact both \"minimal\". Recommends normal operations and states weather/roads do not justify a snow day or delay.\n• News/community intel: No district or neighboring district closure announcements, no special weather messaging, no event cancellations, and social media sentiment is quiet (\"no_buzz\").\n\nAll four lines of evidence independently point to: (a) no active storm, (b) manageable winter roads, and (c) no institutional or community movement toward closure.\n\n2. Conflicts and clarifications\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n• Meteorology vs. Safety: Both say conditions are cold but dry, with only localized slick spots. No disagreement on timing or severity.\n• Meteorology vs. History: Forecast fits a common mid‑January, post‑system pattern with extremely low historical closure rate. Alignment is strong.\n• Safety vs. News Intel: Good road conditions and lack of active hazards are consistent with the absence of closure chatter or official alerts.\nThe only slight nuance is that the safety report flags a \"moderate\" ice formation risk in the abstract, but then immediately characterizes actual Monday‑morning impacts as minimal and manageable. That nuance does not rise to a real conflict.\n\n3. Plow timing math\n• Worst conditions from the prior minor event: Saturday 2026‑01‑10, roughly 17:00–22:00 local.\n• Sunday 2026‑01‑11: Dry, below‑freezing, breezy, no new snow or rain.\n• School start: about 7:40 AM Monday 2026‑01‑12.\nThat leaves all of Sunday daytime and Sunday night (well over 24 hours after the last meaningful precip) for plows and salt to work. With total new snow since Saturday being light and no additional overnight accumulation, Kent County’s experienced crews can easily clear and treat roads. By bus time, conditions should be standard winter driving, not storm conditions.\n\n4. Ice considerations\n• Air temps stay below freezing, so any remaining moisture can refreeze.\n• However, there is no new precipitation Sunday into Monday: no rain, freezing rain, or drizzle to create fresh glaze ice.\n• Safety analysis expects only isolated slick spots on bridges, shaded curves, and lesser‑traveled roads/sidewalks, not widespread ice.\nGiven Michigan norms, scattered slick patches are handled by standard salting and winter driving protocols and are not usually enough to cancel school absent other hazards. There is no signal of a true ice event.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals\n• News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD and found no pre‑announced closures for Jan 12.\n• Kent County messaging focuses on weight restrictions related to thaw, not snow/ice hazards, reinforcing the non‑event character of this period.\n• Social media and local chatter show no organized expectation of a snow day – no \"everyone’s talking about shutting down\" signal.\nUnder the competition rules, we would only bump probabilities up if there were multiple neighboring closures or strong community expectation; here, there is the opposite: region‑wide normal operations.\n\n6. How each expert was weighted\n• Meteorology (35% weight): Direct forecast of 0\" new snow, dry conditions, and no active advisories at decision time. On its own, this suggests a closure probability near the very bottom of the Michigan threshold scale (~5–10%).\n• Safety (25%): High road and travel scores, minimal commute impact, normal operations recommended. This reinforces a very low probability, keeping the estimate near 5–10%.\n• History (20%): Analog snow‑day rates of ~2–5% for this exact synoptic setup in Rockford/Kent County. Pulls the forecast slightly toward the lower end of our internal range.\n• News/Intel (20% – \"secret weapon\"): No closure announcements, no buzz, no neighboring‑district moves. Crucially, there are no positive closure signals that would justify any upward adjustment. In fact, the lack of buzz supports staying at or just above the historical base rate.\n\n7. Calibration vs. Michigan thresholds\nYour provided Michigan thresholds:\n• <4\" snow → 5–15%\nHere we have 0\" new snow and no ice storm. That firmly places this day at the very bottom of that bracket. Given local tolerance for winter weather and the complete absence of an active event, the calibrated Brier‑score‑focused choice is toward the low edge.\n\n8. Final probability and confidence\nCombining:\n• Historical analogs (~2–5%).\n• Dry forecast and strong infrastructure (argues near 5%).\n• Slight residual risk from patchy ice and the generic possibility of last‑minute issues (argues not going all the way to 0–2%).\nI set the final snow‑day probability at 5% with high confidence. This is decisively out of the 40–60% uncertainty band and aligned with both data and Michigan closure norms.\n\n9. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main failure modes are:\n• A late‑developing, poorly forecast band of snow or freezing drizzle Sunday night that materially changes conditions after this analysis.\n• A non‑weather operational issue (major power outage, heating failures, or a significant accident impacting transportation).\n• An unexpectedly cautious administrative decision unrelated to the forecast pattern (for example, stacking a closure on top of other calendar factors). These are historically rare in Rockford with this kind of weather.\nBecause these scenarios are low‑probability but not impossible, I do not go to 0–2%; 5% captures these tail risks while still recognizing that, based on all four expert inputs, a normal school day is overwhelmingly likely.",
