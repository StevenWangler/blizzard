The main school-impact risk is ice/visibility: a brief light freezing rain signal around midnight followed by freezing fog with periods of near-zero visibility (especially pre-dawn into early morning). Even tiny glaze/black-ice plus dense freezing fog can create hazardous bus and commute conditions despite minimal precip.

The main watch-outs are (1) a trace freezing drizzle/freezing rain around midnight and (2) very low visibility/freezing fog indications overnight into early morning. In Michigan, that combination more commonly produces isolated slick spots and occasional delays rather than a full closure—unless the fog/drizzle produces a meaningful glaze over a wide area or untreated roads remain hazardous from prior-day conditions. Confidence is medium because the highest-impact factor here (thin ice/visibility near daybreak) can be highly localized and sensitive to small temperature/dewpoint changes."

Web verification is inconclusive/conflicting with the snippets retrieved: (1) Weather.com (US unit page) shows morning feels-like around ~1–2°F with temps mid-to-upper teens, which is warmer than WeatherAPI by ~4–6°F on feels-like; (2) an alternate Weather.com locale page shows much colder feels-like values (down near -22°C to -24°C), which would be substantially colder than your API; (3) Weather Underground content in the crawl snippet appears to be for Jan 22, 2026, not Jan 29, so it can't verify the target day; (4) a regional local-news forecast mentions Thursday wind chills as low as about -11°F (region-wide), which does not breach -20°F but is not Rockford-specific.

Meteorology cautions it may be an encoding artifact; Safety treats it as a meaningful bus-safety red flag. Web verification could not confirm METAR/AFD, so I weight this as a real risk but with uncertainty.\n3) Plow timing math: Measurable/impactful precip largely wrapped up by late Wed morning/early afternoon, leaving ~17 hours until 6:30 AM Thu for overnight touch-up. Infrastructure expects primaries/bus-route arterials passable by 6:30 AM, with neighborhoods lagging.\n4) Ice: Yes, but mainly isolated black ice/refreeze and spot glazing (not a widespread ice storm). That supports delay/caution more than district-wide closure.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Thu 1/29 closure/delay announcements tonight across nearby districts checked—so no +15–20% cascade bump.\n6) Power: Consumers roll-up shows extremely low outages; no meaningful outage adjustment.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier finds no credible signal of wind chill ≤ -20°F; thus no cold-based near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make this wrong: If dense freezing fog truly produces widespread near-zero visibility on rural routes at 6–8 AM OR if trace icing is more widespread than expected on neighborhood roads/bridges, the district could choose a proactive closure (tail risk). Conversely, if fog is patchy/lifts early, it will be a normal day (or at most increased caution).\n\nWeighting per directive: Meteorology (25%) and Safety (25%) drive the outcome: no snow lowers closure sharply, but the commute-window visibility/black-ice risk keeps a non-trivial tail. History (15%) anchors low closure rates for “no new snow” patterns. News intel (15%) provides no closure-cascade confirmation (keeps probability from rising). Infrastructure (10%) indicates roads mostly passable by 6:30 with neighborhood slick spots (supports delay over closure). Power (5%) lowers outage concern. Web verifier (5%) removes extreme cold as a closure driver.\n\nFinal call: 20% probability of a full closure (snow day). Practical expectation is ‘open’ with an elevated chance of a 1–2 hour delay; however this output specifically estimates closure probability per request.",
