Temps are solidly below freezing through bus time (6–8 AM: ~16°F) with light winds (generally 4–10 mph), producing wind chills roughly 10–11°F—nowhere near the -15°F to -20°F cold-closure thresholds. No accumulating snow is indicated during the critical 5–9 AM window, and the only notable precip signal is very light (0.01\") late evening/night, with a single hour showing light snow around 11 PM. The 'light freezing rain' daily label is a flag to monitor, but the hourly breakdown shows essentially zero precip during school travel time, so the practical risk of icy roads at 6–8 AM appears low. With Michigan plow/salt capacity and no active snowfall at bus time, the snow-day/closure probability for Rockford Schools Tuesday is low (roughly 5–15%), with the main wildcard being any unmodeled early-morning glaze that would quickly raise risk."

In Michigan historical terms, this maps to roughly a 5–15% closure regime, with the main upside risk coming from *unexpected* freezing drizzle/glaze forming near daybreak. I’d center the full-closure probability around ~8–12%, with a smaller ‘delay’ risk (~10–20%) if early-morning spot icing is observed on untreated secondary roads."

The only meaningful disagreement is how much to weight the daily ‘light freezing rain’ label versus the dry hourly breakdown. Meteorology and infrastructure both interpret that label as likely a coarse categorization/near-saturation signal with, at most, a low-probability trace freezing drizzle risk—enough to justify monitoring and possible targeted treatment, but not enough to expect a district-wide closure in Michigan. News intelligence finds no confirmed neighboring-district closures and no Rockford closure/delay messaging; that strongly argues against a preemptive closure. Power-grid risk is not a driver here (no verified outage event and forecast QPF is too small for widespread ice-loading), though outage data is not fully verifiable in-session.

For Tuesday, Feb 24, 2026, the available public-facing district signal is neutral-to-normal (no closure banner found; routine calendar note about Wed Feb 25 early release). The only meaningful external operational indicator is KCRC bridge pre-treatment for possible icing—worth monitoring, but not enough by itself to push closure odds high absent confirmed morning-commute freezing rain or a wave of nearby districts preemptively calling it. With peers’ meteorology/safety assessments pointing to minimal precip during the bus window and only trace totals, the most plausible outcome is school open, with a small tail risk for a late-breaking delay/closure if a surprise glaze develops before buses roll. Net: low but non-zero probability, centered around 10%."
