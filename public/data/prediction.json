Temperatures remain well below freezing through the period, so any snow that falls Sunday will stick, but the amount is modest by Michigan standards. Winds are light (generally under ~10–11 mph), limiting blowing/drifting and keeping visibility reductions localized and brief. Bottom line: based on this dataset alone, Monday Feb 9 looks more like a normal winter morning with some residual slick/packed spots possible—more consistent with schools OPEN than closed, unless additional snow develops Sunday night into early Monday (not shown here)."

In Michigan (and especially West Michigan with mature winter operations), ~1 inch of snow by itself historically closes schools only about 5–15% of the time.

When cross-checking the web, Weather.com’s Rockford, MI hourly page shows typical winter feels-like values near -4°C to about -11°C on the currently-loaded hours, BUT another Weather.com hourly view snippet for the same location shows early-morning Feels Like around -25° to -26° (units appear Celsius on that view). Converting -26°C ≈ -15°F; however the page explicitly displays “Feels Like -26°” without clear unit context in the snippet, and there are multiple conflicting locale-based Weather.com renderings. Separately, weatherUSA shows an Extreme Cold Warning on its page, suggesting a materially colder regime than WeatherAPI’s near-term Sunday forecast. NWS digital table snippet captured in tool output is not clearly aligned to Feb 9 for Rockford and does not confirm a -20°F wind-chill event for Monday morning. Net: web sources are inconsistent; one credible-source rendering indicates a sub -20°F apparent temperature threshold breach (per your rule set), but it must be revalidated specifically for Monday 2026-02-09 6–8 AM in °F wind chill/feels-like.",

Infrastructure agrees on the plow-timing math (≈16.5 hours from snow end to bus time) and expects trunklines and primary county/bus routes to be clear to mostly clear by 6:30 AM, with only neighborhood streets lagging.\n\nThe upward risk comes from Safety and News: there is credible regional evidence of icing sensitivity (e.g., Greenville closing Friday for icy roads/sidewalks; prior advisory mentions glaze/freezing drizzle). That raises the chance Monday morning has patchy black ice on less-traveled roads and in lots—conditions that more often trigger a 2-hour delay than a full closure in Michigan.\n\nKey conflict: the Web Weather Verification includes a critical flag citing Weather.com showing “Feels Like -26°” around 6–8 AM, but the verifier also notes inconsistent locale renders and unclear unit context, and the meteorologist’s Monday estimate does not support extreme-cold thresholds. Because this looks like a data-integrity/unit issue rather than a confirmed -20°F-or-colder bus-hour wind chill for Feb 9, I do not apply the automatic 90–95% rule here. If ANY credible source is clearly showing ≤-20°F (in °F) for Rockford during 6–8 AM on Monday, the probability should be immediately revised upward to 90–95%.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for closures, no confirmed closure cascade, and strong plow timing, I land at 24% for a full snow day (closure).

That points to a mostly-normal Monday with some localized slick spots—more consistent with “open” than “closed,” though a 2-hour delay is plausible if secondary/rural roads glaze overnight. The main upward uncertainty is the Monday 6–8 AM wind chill/precip forecast (missing here) and the inconsistent third-party ‘feels like’ snippet.

That scenario usually does **not** produce a full closure; it more often produces normal operations or, at most, a delay if secondary roads polish over. I’m nudging upward from ~10% to **14%** because peers (Safety/Infrastructure) highlight non-snow hazards: refreeze/black-ice potential on low-volume roads and the fact that a Winter Weather Advisory with some icing exists on Fri Feb 6 (possible residual slickness)."

The provided WeatherAPI-style dataset supports a light, daytime Sunday snow (~1 inch) with ample time to plow/salt before Monday, and winds are light—both argue against a high closure probability.\n\nHowever, because the dataset stops on Sunday and because there was a Friday (2026-02-06) glaze/freezing-drizzle advisory, I can’t dismiss the chance that untreated back roads refreeze into a slick Monday commute. That pushes me above the ‘routine’ 10–15% historical baseline but still well below 50% absent evidence of overnight Sunday-to-Monday snow/ice or verified extreme cold/wind chill.\n\nNet: I’d argue for a *low-to-moderate* snow-day probability, with “2-hour delay” more likely than full closure if anything materializes."

Right now, the provided evidence points to a routine winter scenario: light Sunday snow (~1 inch) ending well before evening, plus cold temperatures that could create slick spots but usually lead to ‘open’ or at most a delay. I’m keeping probability above the pure-meteorology baseline (~10%) because: recent advisory/icing narrative in the region and the known sensitivity to road conditions in Kent County can produce surprise delays/closures when side roads glaze. But absent a verified Monday-morning extreme cold/ice signal or a growing closings cascade, a full snow day remains unlikely."
