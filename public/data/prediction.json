Temperatures hover near freezing (31–35°F) with wind chills in the mid‑20s, light W/WSW winds under 10 mph, and no new precipitation expected. The main issue is freezing fog between about 5–10 AM with modeled visibilities occasionally under 1 mile, but this occurs without falling snow or ice, and winds are modest. Given Michigan’s high tolerance and the absence of accumulating snow or active icing on Wednesday itself, the weather pattern strongly favors a normal school day. Any residual slick spots from Tuesday’s freezing rain will likely be treated or improved by Wednesday morning. Overall, the risk of a weather‑related full snow day closure on Wednesday is very low; at most, there could be localized patchy slick spots and some fog‑related caution on the commute, but not enough for a district‑wide closure in typical Michigan practice."

The classic Michigan closure triggers—heavy snow (8–10\"+), ongoing ice storm, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold below about -15°F wind chill—are absent. Instead, the day features overcast skies, temps near freezing, light to moderate winds, and no new precip. The main residual risk is leftover slick spots from Tuesday’s freezing rain plus morning freezing fog, but with the advisory ending by midday Tuesday and no additional overnight icing signal, those hazards are typically manageable with standard treatment. Historically for this region and week of the year, that pattern points to school being in session, with perhaps localized caution on back roads rather than a district‑wide snow (or ice) day."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist: Quiet weather, no new snow or freezing rain, just freezing fog and temps near 32°F. States risk of full closure is very low.\n- Historian: Nearly identical setups historically lead to in‑session days; closure rates 1–3%, at most ~10% when prior‑day icing was worse and advisory‑level.\n- Safety Analyst: Road and travel scores (6–7/10) indicate manageable conditions. Recommends monitoring and treatment, and even notes that the forecast does NOT justify a full snow day; at most a short delay if overnight icing surprises on the high side.\n- News/Intel: No Rockford or neighboring district closures, no media storm coverage, no road‑emergency alerts, and no visible social‑media buzz. Signals are consistent with a normal school day.\nAll four broadly agree this is a routine Michigan winter morning with some caution, not a closure setup.\n\n2. ANY CONFLICTS?\n- The only mild tension is that the safety analysis calls the risk level “moderate” due to freezing fog and residual ice potential, while meteorology/historical data frame the overall closure likelihood as “very low.”\n- This isn’t a true contradiction: moderate *commute* risk can coexist with very low *district‑wide closure* probability in a state with high winter tolerance like Michigan. No expert suggests conditions rise to typical closure triggers.\nGiven that, I interpret the safety “moderate” rating as a call for operational caution, not justification for canceling school.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Active icing/freezing‑rain advisory ends around midday Tuesday, Jan 6.\n- No new precip is expected Tuesday evening or overnight into Wednesday.\n- School start around ~7:40 AM Wednesday.\nThat gives well over 18 hours from the end of the advisory‑level icing (around Tuesday midday) to the Wednesday start of school. Local road crews and school maintenance have a full afternoon/evening plus the overnight period:\n- Plenty of time to salt/sand primaries and secondaries.\n- Adequate time for lots and sidewalks to be treated before 6 AM Wednesday, as the safety analyst recommends.\nFreezing fog from about 5–10 AM may add a light rime in spots, but with air temps around 30–33°F and pre‑treated surfaces, that’s a nuisance hazard, not a system‑wide failure point.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Key: No ongoing freezing rain or mixed precip overnight or during the Wednesday morning commute.\n- Ice formation risk is rated “moderate” but specifically tied to:\n  • Normal overnight refreeze of Tuesday’s moisture, and\n  • Possible thin rime from freezing fog.\n- Temperatures stay roughly around freezing with a rising trend toward/above 32°F, limiting severe hard‑freeze development.\n- No signal of a fresh glaze event or widespread black‑ice outbreak beyond what crews can handle.\nSo there is *some* ice risk on untreated rural/hilly segments, but not of the magnitude or coverage that typically drives a full snow/ice day in Kent County.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel finds **no confirmed closures or delays** for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD, or Rockford itself for Jan 7.\n- No regional TV or print outlet is running a “schools closed tomorrow” type story for this date.\n- No county‑level travel advisories or storm alerts aimed at the school commute window.\nPer your weighting rules, the absence of 3+ neighboring district closures means there is **no upward adjustment** (0% bump). If anything, the quiet regional picture supports staying at the low end of any plausible probability range.\n\n6. HOW I WEIGHTED EACH EXPERT (TOTAL 100%)\n- Meteorology (35%): 0\" snowfall, 0% snow/ice probability for the morning, light winds, and only patchy freezing fog. This strongly argues against a closure. I anchor the baseline around 5–7% on this alone.\n- Safety (25%): Moderate risk but explicitly says a full snow day is not indicated, suggesting that hazards are operationally manageable. This supports keeping the closure probability in the single digits, perhaps nudging it a hair above pure‑weather baseline to account for residual ice uncertainty.\n- History (20%): Empirical analogs for this pattern show 1–3% closure odds, maybe up to ~10% when prior‑day icing was more significant. This tugs the estimate back down, reinforcing that double‑digit probabilities would be overstatement.\n- News Intelligence (20%): No buzz, no closures, no advisories. In your framework, this is the “secret weapon”: if neighbors were closing, I’d add 15–20%. Instead, I apply **no positive adjustment** and treat this as confirmation that the true probability is at the low historical end.\nBlending these, I land at **about 6%**: slightly above the bare‑minimum 1–3% closure background because of residual ice and fog, but clearly inside the “very low” range.\n\n7. WHY 6% AND NOT HIGHER (OR LOWER)\n- The meteorological and historical data alone could justify something in the 3–5% range.\n- The safety assessment’s ‘moderate’ label and specific mention of freezing fog/spotty slick areas justify a small upward nudge—there is a non‑zero chance that early‑morning road checks find worse‑than‑modeled ice, leading to a last‑minute delay or, less likely, a closure.\n- However, **zero** neighboring district closures, **zero** media alarm, and an advisory that ends well before the school day argue strongly against anything near 10%.\nBalancing calibration (for Brier score) with decisiveness, 6% is a precise expression of “quite unlikely, but not impossible if overnight conditions surprise.”\n\n8. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nMy prediction would likely be too low if:\n- A localized, unforecast freezing‑drizzle or freezing‑fog event produces a much thicker glaze (0.05–0.10\") across key bus routes between about 3–6 AM, overwhelming prior treatment.\n- Temperatures dip a few degrees below forecast (mid‑20s instead of near 30°F), causing extensive black ice on secondaries, hills, and bridges, leading transportation staff to judge conditions unsafe.\n- A serious crash cluster or emergency‑services advisory emerges early Wednesday (e.g., ‘multiple spinouts, avoid travel’), prompting a conservative closure decision despite modest raw weather metrics.\n- New late‑night information (not visible at analysis time) shows multiple neighboring districts declaring closures or delays, exerting peer pressure on Rockford to follow.\nGiven current data, all of these are low‑probability contingencies, which is why the forecast remains in the single digits.\n\n9. BOTTOM LINE\nGiven Michigan’s higher thresholds, lack of new snow or active ice, and the completely quiet regional news/closure landscape, the most defensible and well‑calibrated assessment is that **Rockford Public Schools are very likely to be open on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026**, with at most standard winter‑caution procedures and possibly a short delay only if overnight icing turns out materially worse than forecast.",
