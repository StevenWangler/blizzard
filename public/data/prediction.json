Temperatures stay well below freezing (low ~4°F, rising to low teens by bus time and mid-20s later), winds are light (generally 0–9 mph), and the forecast shows 0\" snow/0\" precip. The only meaningful transportation risk is localized freezing fog/low visibility (vis occasionally ~1 mile in the evening per the dataset, with some hours showing very low/zero vis values that often represent patchy fog or a data artifact). Wind chills during the 6–8 AM window run about +5°F to +7°F (NOT near the -15°F/-20°F closure thresholds). Net: schools should operate normally; at most, expect isolated slick spots/visibility dips on untreated roads/low-lying areas if fog forms, but this alone rarely closes Michigan districts."

      "**Freezing fog late evening (around 11 PM Wed) is a visibility + glaze risk**, but it’s after dismissal. It matters mainly for evening activities and for setting up potential slickness into early Thursday if fog deposits rime/glaze on untreated surfaces.",
      "**Bus route risk concentration:** prioritize checks on (1) rural two-lanes and gravel, (2) hill crests and stop-sign approaches, (3) bridge decks, (4) neighborhood streets that may have packed snow from prior days.",
      "**Operational call:** If roads are dry to mostly dry by late evening Tuesday (2026-02-03) and overnight, Rockford should be able to run normally Wednesday. A delay is only justified if crews observe widespread black ice at 5:30–6:00 AM or if freezing fog unexpectedly develops pre-dawn (not shown here).",
      "**Cold exposure:** Wind chills around the morning commute are roughly +5 to +9°F (not near the ≤ -20°F automatic-closure threshold). Still, plan for bus warm-up reliability and minimize outdoor waiting time for younger students."

None of the web sources I pulled show wind chill/feels-like at or below -20°F, so the automatic closure trigger is NOT met based on the evidence retrieved. That said, the feels-like discrepancy versus WeatherAPI is large enough (>10°F in some comparisons) that a cautious snow-day/closure model should treat the morning as meaningfully colder than WeatherAPI indicates unless NWS/AccuWeather confirmation aligns with WeatherAPI.

Meteorology shows 0\" precip/snow and light winds, which in West Michigan strongly favors staying open. History supports a very low closure base rate for ‘cold but dry’ days (~3–8%), with only a small tail risk if freezing fog or refreeze becomes widespread. Safety analysis explains the ‘moderate’ commute impact is driven by uncertainty about residual moisture from Tuesday and the fact that at ~10–15°F any moisture becomes persistent ice on bridges, shaded stretches, rural connectors, and neighborhood streets—conditions that more often justify a *2-hour delay* than a full cancellation. News intelligence shows no neighboring district closures posted (FOX17 still empty), no buzz, and no outage chatter; that removes the usual “domino effect” pressure. Power-grid checks show minimal outages and decreasing trend, making outage-driven closure unlikely. There is a notable wind-chill discrepancy between WeatherAPI and Weather.com variants (roughly +5°F to as low as ~-15°F feels-like), but none meet the ≤ -20°F automatic closure trigger; even at -15°F, Rockford might consider cold-exposure mitigations but this is typically not enough alone to close without other hazards. Net: full snow day/closure remains unlikely; the more realistic operational risk is a *delay* if pre-dawn route checks find widespread glaze on bus routes.",

That combination almost always yields an ‘open’ school day. I’m not at 0% because (a) today’s observed light snow/freezing precip raises the odds of leftover moisture refreezing on untreated roads, and (b) there is at least some indication of low visibility/freezing fog potential in the dataset (even if the strongest fog signal is late evening). Net: low chance of a full snow day; a delay is the more plausible outcome if black ice is widespread at 5:30–7:00 AM."

That combination usually produces **normal operations or a delay**, not a full snow day, unless ice becomes widespread across bus routes. Net for **Wed Feb 4, 2026**: low single-digit to ~10% closure risk; I settle at **6%** for a full snow day."

Those hazards can justify heightened route checks and potentially a *delay* if widespread slickness is observed at 5:30–6:30 AM, but with no accumulating precip expected and light winds, the probability of a full snow day remains low. I’m placing the snow-day (full closure) probability at 7%, with the bulk of risk coming from the uncertainty around fog/visibility fields and whether any residual moisture from Tuesday is widespread enough to create systemic bus safety issues."

As of Tue Feb 3, 2026 (mid-morning), there are no closure/delay postings showing up on FOX 17’s system and no RPS announcement indicating a change for Wed Feb 4 beyond the already-planned Early Release. With no storm/accumulation forecast for Wednesday, the dominant operational outcome is a normal school day (with the planned early release). The residual risk is almost entirely an overnight surprise (refreeze/black ice or dense freezing fog expanding into the 5:30–8:00 AM window), which typically produces delays more than full cancellations. Net: low single-digit full snow-day odds; I’m setting 6% to reflect that “surprise icy morning” tail risk."
