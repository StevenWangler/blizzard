However, with the precip window very narrow and ending before the main commute, Michigan’s high snow tolerance suggests plows/road crews can keep up. Expect a likely NORMAL school day or at most a DELAY risk driven by cold/wind chill safety and any localized blowing snow/visibility issues; a full closure would be more likely if the fog/near-zero visibility reports materialize right at morning bus time or if there is unseen ice, but the provided data does not show a sustained heavy snow/ice storm."

However, because the modeled snowfall total is near zero, the classic Michigan closure trigger of 8–10+ inches with bad timing is not present. The key swing factors are (1) whether blowing snow/brief snow showers around ~5–8 AM produce slick roads/low visibility, and (2) how widespread/dense any freezing fog/low vis becomes near daybreak. Overall confidence: medium-low, because small changes in banded snow/visibility can change operational impacts even when totals are low."

    "verification_summary": "Target school day: Tuesday, 2026-01-27 (Rockford, MI 49341). Your WeatherAPI forecast shows wind-chill/feels-like values roughly -5°F to about -8°F during the daytime hours, with minimums around ~-5°F to ~-8°F for much of Tuesday and late evening. However, a Weather.com hourly page for Rockford, MI displays forecast 'Feels Like' values as low as about -23°F to -24°F (below the -20°F closure trigger), while another Weather.com hourly view for Rockford shows much milder feels-like values (around +1°F to +6°F) for parts of the morning/early day—these two public-facing Weather.com views conflict sharply. The NWS page I could reliably access is for a nearby point (Wayland, MI) and confirms a Cold Weather Advisory timing that matches your WeatherAPI alert text (Mon evening through Tue morning) and implies wind chills approaching the -15 to -20 range, but it does not by itself confirm <-20°F for Rockford specifically. Weather Underground’s hourly details could not be extracted due to a JavaScript-rendered interface in the crawl.\n\nNet: I can confirm (1) cold + some snow showers are plausible, and (2) the existence/timing of a Cold Weather Advisory window (Mon night into Tue morning) in the area, but (3) web sources are currently conflicting on whether Rockford’s Tuesday-morning wind chill drops below -20°F. Because ANY source showing <-20°F triggers automatic closure consideration in your workflow, the -23°F/-24°F Weather.com reading is a provisional trigger and should be treated as 'needs immediate confirmation' with additional authoritative, Rockford-specific pages (NWS MapClick for Rockford/Kent County or NWS wind chill grids) and AccuWeather RealFeel.",

One Weather.com variant showed -23°F to -24°F (closure trigger), but the Web Weather Verifier confirmed an authoritative NWS Rockford-specific MapClick forecast stating Tuesday wind chills only as low as about -2°F (and tonight as low as -5°F). That contradiction pushes me to *downweight* the extreme Weather.com value as a page/variant mismatch.\n3) Plow timing math: the infrastructure monitor places the main burst ~05:00–06:00 with only ~0.5–1.5 hours before ~06:30 bus rollout; arterials likely passable but not clean, and local streets likely still partly snow-covered. This supports delay risk more than full closure.\n4) Ice: safety flags “moderate” ice risk, but there is no clear new freezing-rain/glaze signal—more consistent with refreeze/packed-snow/bridge-deck slickness. That typically elevates delay risk, not automatic closure.\n5) Neighboring districts: news intel found NO verified Tue 1/27 closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts at this time; only general media hints that Tuesday is the best chance. Therefore no +15–20% domino adjustment.\n6) Power outages: confirmed negligible (Kent County ~1 customer affected); no adjustment.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS Rockford point forecast contradicts ≤ -20°F; therefore I do NOT apply the near-automatic cold closure rule.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) if wind chills actually verify ≤ -20°F in Rockford 6–8 AM (or an updated NWS product flips colder); (b) if a narrow lake-effect band produces a quick coating and widespread near-zero visibility right at bus time; (c) if neighboring districts begin closing in a cluster overnight.\n\nWeighting (per directive):\n- Meteorology (25%): low snow totals + short-lived burst → closure unlikely.\n- Safety (20%): moderate risk with tight morning window → pushes up modestly.\n- History (15%): similar patterns usually open or delay → modest.\n- News (15%): no confirmed closures/buzz → keeps probability from rising.\n- Infrastructure (10%): local streets behind by 6:30 → supports some closure risk but more delay.\n- Power (10%): no outages → no bump.\n- Web verifier (5%): resolves cold-trigger conflict toward NWS → prevents big increase.\n\nResult: **23%** for a full Rockford snow day (closure).

I land at **22%** for a full snow day (closure), with the majority of risk concentrated in (1) whether wind chills truly verify at or below about **-20°F** at bus-stop time and (2) whether visibility drops are widespread (not just pockets) during the commute.\n\nIf you are counting **delay OR closure** as “snow day,” I’d be materially higher; but for **full closure**, history keeps me in the low-to-mid 20s.",
            "keyFactors": [
              "**History of closures in West Michigan:** Rockford/Grand Rapids-area districts usually tolerate *cold + light snow* without full closure; the classic “sure thing” closures are heavy overnight totals (often several inches+) or significant ice. Here, forecast snow accumulation is essentially **0** (despite a “blowing snow” hour), which historically points away from a full snow day.",
              "**Cold as the main driver (not snow):** The best historical analogue is an arctic outbreak with wind chills around **-15°F to -20°F** during bus pickup—these more often produce **delays** than full-day cancellations unless the district has a hard wind-chill threshold or the cold coincides with other compounding hazards (ice, widespread near-whiteout, power issues).",
              "**Brief, poorly-timed hazard window:** The forecast’s most concerning operational slice is roughly **5–6 AM** (blowing snow / precip + low vis). Historically, a short, intense window *can* produce closures if it overlaps bus routes, but it more commonly yields slower travel + spot treatment + sometimes a delay—especially if conditions improve after sunrise.",

Historically, *true* widespread dense fog at bus time can drive closures, but without corroboration it’s a weaker prior than snowfall/ice totals.",

The meaningful hazards are (1) short-lived pre-dawn blowing snow/low visibility that could create patchy slick travel for buses, and (2) very cold wind chills overlapping the morning commute, raising exposure risk at stops and increasing the chance of delays/transport disruptions. Those hazards are more consistent with a **delay** than a full closure. I’m placing a **22%** chance of a full snow day/closure, mainly because if the lower-visibility pockets and/or wind chill verifies in the <-20°F range *in Rockford specifically* during pickup time, districts can pivot to closure for safety and reliability even without big snow totals.",

There is clear regional cold-risk messaging (Cold Weather Advisory overnight into Tuesday morning) and some early-morning blowing snow/low-visibility potential, plus recent closure behavior from nearby districts that can create a domino effect. Against that, Rockford has not posted an official closure/delay, and the meteorology data supplied does not support a high-accumulation or widespread ice event on Tuesday itself—usually the biggest driver of mass closures.\n\nTherefore I’m setting a modest-but-real closure probability (22%). I would price ‘2-hour delay’ as more likely than a full closure, but since the task is specifically “snow day” probability, I keep it below ~25%.

I land at **22%** for a full snow day (closure), with the majority of risk concentrated in (1) whether wind chills truly verify at or below about **-20°F** at bus-stop time and (2) whether visibility drops are widespread (not just pockets) during the commute.\n\nIf you are counting **delay OR closure** as “snow day,” I’d be materially higher; but for **full closure**, history keeps me in the low-to-mid 20s."

The meaningful hazards are (1) short-lived pre-dawn blowing snow/low visibility that could create patchy slick travel for buses, and (2) very cold wind chills overlapping the morning commute, raising exposure risk at stops and increasing the chance of delays/transport disruptions. Those hazards are more consistent with a **delay** than a full closure. I’m placing a **22%** chance of a full snow day/closure, mainly because if the lower-visibility pockets and/or wind chill verifies in the <-20°F range *in Rockford specifically* during pickup time, districts can pivot to closure for safety and reliability even without big snow totals."

There is clear regional cold-risk messaging (Cold Weather Advisory overnight into Tuesday morning) and some early-morning blowing snow/low-visibility potential, plus recent closure behavior from nearby districts that can create a domino effect. Against that, Rockford has not posted an official closure/delay, and the meteorology data supplied does not support a high-accumulation or widespread ice event on Tuesday itself—usually the biggest driver of mass closures.\n\nTherefore I’m setting a modest-but-real closure probability (22%). I would price ‘2-hour delay’ as more likely than a full closure, but since the task is specifically “snow day” probability, I keep it below ~25%. The confidence is limited mainly by (a) the conflicting wind chill numbers across public sources and (b) the possibility that localized visibility/black-ice conditions are worse than modeled right at bus time."
