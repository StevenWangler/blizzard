Temperatures hover just above freezing all day (around 34–35°F) and even into Tuesday night, so roads are unlikely to ice up, especially after a dry period. Forecast precipitation is essentially zero: no rain, no snow, and no freezing drizzle in the school window. Humidity is very high (95–99%) with overcast skies and periods of mist, bringing localized reductions in visibility to about 1 mile at times, but this is well within what Michigan districts routinely handle. Winds are light to modest (generally 5–8 mph, gusts near 10–14 mph) from the west by day, producing wind chills in the mid-20s but not hazardous. There are no weather alerts in effect. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for snow and the total absence of accumulating snow or ice, the probability of a weather-related school closure or delay for Tuesday is effectively near zero. Expect a normal school day with possible dreary, misty conditions but no significant travel impacts."

Historically, Rockford and similar West Michigan districts do not call snow days under this regime. Closures typically require one or more of: (1) a substantial snow event (often 8–10+ inches in 12–24 hours, especially overnight into the morning commute); (2) an ice storm leading to widespread glazing and power issues; or (3) extreme cold with dangerous wind chills. None of those triggers appear in this forecast. Even allowing for normal forecast uncertainty, there is no signal here of a rapidly developing storm or arctic outbreak. The most plausible minor issue is patchy mist/fog with reduced visibility at times, but this is a routine operational challenge rather than a closure driver. Overall, historical analogs for late‑December Rockford with similar temperature, wind, and precipitation characteristics point to an extremely low probability of a snow day for 2025-12-23. Confidence in a \"no snow day\" outcome is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts:\n- Meteorology: No snow, no meaningful precip, temps just above freezing, no alerts, routine gray day.\n- History: Similar past patterns in late December for Rockford show essentially a 0% snow day rate; closures in this region usually require 6–10+ inches of snow, ice storms, or extreme cold—none present.\n- Safety: Road and travel scores are very high (8–9/10), risk level tagged as low, and commute impacts minimal; only minor caution for patchy mist and isolated slick spots.\n- News/Intel: Major West Michigan closing boards (FOX 17, etc.) show no closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, and there’s no strong community expectation of a snow day.\nAll four experts independently point to normal operations. There are no substantive conflicts: the only slight tension is the safety analyst labeling ice risk as \"moderate\" while meteorology shows zero freezing hours and no active precip; taken together, that suggests only hyper-local shady slick spots, not systemic hazard.\n\n2. Plow timing math:\n- No new snow or meaningful precip is expected from midnight through school day, so there is effectively nothing to plow.\n- With no accumulation and above-freezing air temps, any residual moisture on main routes will either stay wet or be handled by routine salting before buses roll.\n- From any minor overnight dampness to the 7:40 AM bell, crews would have 2–4+ hours of margin, but in practice there is no plow-driven constraint on operations.\n\n3. Ice considerations:\n- Meteorology: 0 freezing hours, temps hovering 34–35°F with no forecast freezing drizzle or mixed precip during the commute window.\n- Safety: Flags only a general \"moderate\" ice formation risk and advises checking bridges/overpasses and known trouble spots.\n- History: On days like this (near-freezing but dry), Rockford historically runs school without disruption.\nTogether this supports: possible isolated slick patches, not an ice-event. This falls far below the district’s usual closure threshold.\n\n4. Neighboring district behavior:\n- News/Intel explicitly notes no closures or delays listed for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD on the main closing boards.\n- There is no cluster of regional shutdowns and no power or major road emergency signals.\nGiven the explicit rule that 3+ neighboring district closures justify a +15–20% bump, here we have the opposite: zero neighbors closed, so there is no upward adjustment.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): 0\" snow, no precip, above-freezing temps → meteorological snow-day probability ≈ 0–2%.\n- Safety (25%): High road scores, low risk, minimal commute impact → safety-based closure probability ≈ 0–3%.\n- History (20%): Analog events show effectively 0% closure rate → historical component ≈ 0–1%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures on boards, no community expectation of a snow day → news component ≈ 0–3%.\nCombining these yields a blended baseline near 1–2%. Allowing for residual uncertainties (unmodeled micro-icing, last-minute administrative caution), I round slightly up to 3% to avoid an overconfident 0% while still being clearly in the \"very unlikely\" regime.\n\n6. Avoiding the 40–60% band:\nThe evidence is strongly one-sided toward a normal school day: no storm, no ice event, no regional closure pattern, and very supportive history. There is no genuine conflict that would justify a mid-range (40–60%) probability. A low but non-zero value (3%) best fits the data and the Brier-score competition goal.\n\nConclusion: The integrated signal from meteorology, safety, history, and real-time news/community intel points overwhelmingly toward school being open with on-time start and only routine winter-driving caution needed.",
