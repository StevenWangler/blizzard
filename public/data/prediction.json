    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Monday, December 8, 2025, this is a classic cold, overcast but quiet winter day—**not** a snow day setup by Michigan standards.\n\n• **Temperatures:** Lows around 15–16°F at the bus window (6–8 AM) and highs only near 22–23°F. It stays below freezing all day, so anything already on the ground stays frozen, but there is **no new precipitation** to worsen conditions.\n\n• **Precipitation:** Forecast shows **0.00\" liquid and 0.0 cm snow** for the entire 24 hours, with **0% chance of snow or rain** day and night. The ice/freezing rain issues are confined to Sunday; by very late Sunday night into Monday, high pressure and dry air have moved in. No accumulating snow, no freezing drizzle, and no mixed precip are indicated during the overnight or morning commute.\n\n• **Surface/road impacts:** \n  - Sunday saw light freezing rain/snow, but that ends well before midnight and plow/salt crews have all night to clean up.\n  - With dry conditions and light winds overnight, main roads should be in good shape by Monday morning, especially for a West Michigan district accustomed to much worse (4–6\"+ events, active icing, or ongoing heavy snow). Side streets and rural roads may remain slick in spots because of the deep cold, but that’s normal winter driving, not closure‑level.\n\n• **Wind and wind chill:** Winds mostly 3–9 mph (gusts under ~20 mph) from NE early, then turning S. Wind chills during the morning commute are in the single digits (around 7–9°F). That is cold but **well within typical Michigan winter operating range** and below any kind of extreme‑cold closure threshold.\n\n• **Visibility:** Model output has a few hours with very low vis flags (near 0–1 mile) despite no precip; that pattern usually reflects **patchy fog or low stratus**, not a widespread blizzard or whiteout. Most daytime hours show visibility 4–6 miles. With no falling or blowing snow, visibility issues are unlikely to be severe or district‑wide.\n\n• **No weather alerts:** There are no active watches, warnings, or advisories for this period in the provided data.\n\n**Bottom line for snow day odds (Rockford Public Schools, Mon 12/8/2025):**\n- No ongoing snow or ice during the critical 3–7 AM window.\n- Dry but cold, light winds, and only spotty reduced visibility at times.\n- Previous day’s icing has ended well before morning with ample time for treatment.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather, the probability of a weather‑related closure or delay on Monday, December 8 appears **very low (on the order of 0–5%)**. Expect school to be **open on time** with typical winter driving caution."

    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast for Monday, 2025-12-08 in Rockford, MI, the expected conditions are: dry weather, overcast skies, air temps roughly 15–23°F, and light winds producing wind chills in the upper single digits to low teens above zero. There is no modeled snow accumulation (0.0 cm), no rain, and no active weather alerts. While Sunday shows some light freezing rain and patchy light snow, the amounts are small and end well before Monday’s commute, with pressure rising and high pressure building in. Historically in Michigan, schools almost never close for this combination of factors: modest cold without extreme wind chill, no active storm, and no significant new snow or ice developing during the bus windows. Closures for just cold generally start to be considered nearer or below -15°F wind chill; here, forecast wind chills are around -13°F at the very coldest overnight, moderating slightly by the typical K–12 start times. Snow-related closures in this region usually involve 8–10+ inches of snow, blowing/drifting from winds much higher than the forecast 5–10 mph, or active ice storms. None of those triggers appear in the data. Given these patterns and typical district behavior, historically similar setups correspond to an extremely low closure rate (on the order of a few percent or less), with almost all such days proceeding as normal school days. Therefore, the historical-context assessment is that Monday, 2025-12-08 very likely proceeds as a regular school day, with only routine winter driving precautions needed, and the probability of a snow/ice/cold-related closing is exceedingly low."

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, cold, dry day Monday with 0% precip, 0.0\" snow, no icing during commute.\n- Historian: Very typical early-December cold/dry pattern; historically almost never a closure in this setup (1–3% at most).\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely in good condition, low overall risk, only routine black-ice spots possible; morning and afternoon commute impacts rated minimal.\n- News/Intel: No pre-announced closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts; regional event calendars normal, no storm headlines.\n\nAgreement: This is a standard Michigan winter day—cold but quiet—with no active storm, no accumulating snow or ice during school hours, and infrastructure accustomed to these conditions. All four implicitly support school being open on time.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There is essentially no material conflict:\n  - Meteorologist pegs snow-day odds \"0–5%\".\n  - Historian infers closure rates around 1–3% for similar patterns.\n  - Safety analyst calls risk \"low\" with normal operations expected.\n  - News/Intel shows no closure momentum and no community push for a snow day.\nDifferences are only in phrasing, not direction; all point to very low closure probability.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow/ice end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Sunday’s light freezing rain/snow ends well before midnight.\n- Monday bus window is roughly 6:00–8:00 AM, with a typical high-school start near 7:40 AM.\n- That gives on the order of 7–9+ hours between end of precip and the first buses, plus overnight salting.\n- Safety analyst notes roads \"consistent with a normal cold winter day\" with only spot black-ice risk.\nThis is ample plow/salt time for West Michigan standards.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Sunday: Light freezing rain/drizzle and patchy light snow occurred but with very small totals and ended well before Monday.\n- Monday: No new precipitation; temperatures stay below freezing so any untreated wet spots can refreeze, but:\n  - Primary and secondary roads are rated 8–9/10 by safety analyst.\n  - No active freezing rain/drizzle is forecast.\n  - Risk is localized black ice on less-traveled surfaces, not a system-wide ice event.\nConclusion: Some residual, patchy ice in typical trouble spots, but no ongoing ice storm or area-wide glazing that would drive closures.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News Intel explicitly reports:\n  - No confirmed pre-announced closures for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent City, or Kent ISD for Monday.\n  - FOX 17 and WZZM closings/alerts show no Monday weather-closure focus.\n- Calendars still display normal events on Dec 8 with no cancellation flags.\nSo there are zero neighboring district closures to push probabilities upward. Per the rules, we do NOT apply any +15–20% closure bump from neighbors.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\nKey ways this forecast could bust:\n- An unmodeled overnight lake-effect snow band develops and dumps several inches between roughly 2–7 AM, cutting visibility and road quality.\n- A surprise round of freezing drizzle/black ice forms late at night, especially if road treatments underperform, leading to widespread crashes before 5–6 AM.\n- A non-weather operational issue (power failure, heating problems, or water main break) forces closure despite decent weather.\nThese are all low-probability tail risks given the current data: high pressure, dry forecast, no alerts, and no social/official chatter about emergent hazards.\n\n2. WEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERT DOMAINS\nUsing the instructed weights: Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News/Intel 20%.\n\n- Meteorology (35%):\n  - Core message: No storm, no new snow or ice, normal cold. Explicit 0–5% closure suggestion.\n  - Given clear, internally consistent data, I treat this as around a 3% closure risk.\n\n- Safety (25%):\n  - Quantitative scores (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, driving 8/10, walking 7/10) and \"low\" risk level strongly support school being open.\n  - This aligns with ~2–4% closure probability—only if overnight refreeze causes more issues than expected.\n\n- History (20%):\n  - Similar-weather patterns show 1–3% closure rates.\n  - No special seasonal adjustments or unusual factors that elevate risk.\n\n- News/Intel (20%):\n  - No neighboring districts are closing or signaling intent.\n  - No media narratives or community sentiment suggesting \"this is a big one\"; sentiment is neutral/\"waiting\", which is typical when there is no real storm.\n  - This supports staying at the low end of any probability range, certainly not adding the +15–20% neighbor-closure bump or the +10–15% community-expectation bump.\n\nCombining these:\n- Meteorology: ~3%\n- Safety: ~3%\n- History: ~2%\n- News/Intel: ~2–3%\nWeighted together, the blended estimate naturally clusters around 2–4%. I choose 3% to stay calibrated but decisive and to avoid an artificially exact \"zero\" that doesn’t acknowledge tail risks.\n\n3. THRESHOLDS VS. CURRENT SETUP (MICHIGAN-SPECIFIC)\n- Snow: Forecast 0\" new snow, far below even the lowest 4\" Michigan threshold.\n- Ice: Only residual, patchy refreeze; no ongoing ice storm or significant accretion.\n- Wind/visibility: Winds under 15 mph, no blowing snow, only localized fog/low clouds flagged.\n- Cold: Wind chills single digits above zero; closures for cold alone in this area tend to start closer to -15°F or lower.\n\nThus, none of the usual Michigan closure triggers (4–6\"+ snow, active icing, blizzard conditions, extreme wind chills) are met.\n\n4. WHY NOT 40–60%?\nThe evidence is strongly one-sided: all four domains converge on \"normal school day\" with only modest, localized hazards. There is no conflicting expert guidance, no storm signal, and no regional closure momentum. Using a 40–60% range would misrepresent the clarity of the situation and hurt Brier score calibration.\n\nTherefore, I set the final snow-day probability at 3% with high confidence that Rockford Public Schools will be open on time Monday, December 8, 2025.\n\nBottom line: Expect a regular school day with standard winter caution, not a snow day.",
