The primary operational issue is persistent fog reducing visibility to about 1 mile from roughly 3 AM through 8 AM (and likely lingering into the morning). Winds are modest (generally 5–10 mph in the morning, peaking near 18 mph late day), and wind chills stay near 29–31°F—nowhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds. With no snow/ice accumulation expected and only light drizzle late evening, a traditional snow day is very unlikely; at most, there’s a small chance of minor transportation delays/caution for buses due to fog, especially on rural roads."

    "confidence_assessment": "Overall: LOW snow-day risk. Based on Michigan historical closure behavior, a no-snow, above-freezing fog/drizzle day typically closes schools only about 3–8% of the time, with most of that tied to rare ‘surprise’ flash-freeze/black-ice reports near bus time. Given your hourly temps holding ~33–34°F through the morning commute and only ~0.02\" liquid total, I’d center the closure probability around ~5% (delays slightly higher, ~10–15%). Confidence is medium because the biggest failure mode is small temperature error (1–2°F) that can sharply change road conditions."

This is a *black-ice* style risk, but not a widespread icing setup given the lack of meaningful precip during the morning hours.",
      "Primary highways/arterials in the Rockford area should be **generally wet and passable** (Michigan maintenance can handle this easily). Secondary/rural roads may have more variable visibility and isolated slickness, but not enough signal here for widespread impassability.",
      "The only measurable precip in this forecast is **light drizzle late (around 11 PM)**, which is *after* the school day. That could matter for **Tuesday night into Wednesday morning** if temps fall, but it’s not a strong driver for a Tuesday (Feb 17) closure.",
      "Operationally: consider **extra bus route time**, use low-beam lights, increase following distance, and be ready for spotty visibility reductions near waterways/low-lying areas. If the district has many rural stops, a *delay* is a more plausible mitigation than a closure.",
      "If early-morning observations show visibilities dropping below ~0.25–0.5 mile across a broad area (true dense fog) *and* surfaces are slick, that combination can push toward a delay—still typically not a full closure in Michigan without ice/snow accumulation."

Meteorology and web verification both show mid-30s temperatures and feels-like around ~29–32°F during 6–9 AM, with 0\" snow and no extreme cold—so Michigan’s main closure triggers (ice storm, blizzard/heavy snow, or ≤-20°F wind chill) are not present. Safety and infrastructure agree the credible hazard is reduced visibility during the bus window, plus isolated slick spots on bridges/overpasses if microclimates briefly touch ~32°F; that profile more often produces slower routes or, at most, a short delay rather than a full closure. News intelligence shows no active closings/delays on a local TV closings page at this time and no confirmed neighboring-district weather closures; additionally, several nearby districts being off for mid-winter break weakens any ‘domino’ closure signal. Power-grid risk is low: only scattered outages countywide, not a widespread event. Given Michigan’s high bar for full closures and the lack of snow/ice/extreme cold, the best Brier-optimized call is a low single-digit closure probability, with monitoring for localized dense fog/spot-ice that could instead justify a delay.",

Since most Michigan school closures are driven by plowable snow, significant ice accretion, extreme wind chills, or widespread power impacts—none of which are present—districtwide closure is unlikely.\n\nThe only plausible weather-driven failure mode is a *small temperature error* (1–2°F colder than forecast) that turns untreated bridges/overpasses slick via freezing fog or a brief freezing drizzle episode around daybreak. However, the provided hourly forecast keeps temps above freezing at the key times, so I keep the closure probability low; if anything, this is more consistent with a possible minor delay than a full snow day."

        "shiftReason": "For Tuesday, February 17, 2026 in Rockford, MI, the pattern is a classic “winter thaw + saturated air” day: temps hovering 33–35°F with persistent fog and negligible precip/snow. Historically, Rockford-area districts and other West Michigan districts are operationally resilient to this setup, and full closures typically require measurable snow/ice accumulation, damaging winds/power issues, or extreme cold—none of which appear in the consensus forecast. The main failure mode is a 1–2°F colder-than-forecast outcome around daybreak that turns fog/drizzle into patchy freezing drizzle and creates bridge/secondary-road slick spots; that scenario can push toward a delay and, more rarely, a closure. Balancing that tail risk against the strong ‘open’ base-rate pattern, I hold a low closure probability at ~5%."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/operations perspective, Tuesday 2026-02-17 looks like an “open but caution” day rather than a snow day. The forecast lacks the classic closure drivers (accumulating snow, significant freezing rain, extreme cold, widespread outages). The real risk is transportation: persistent saturated fog during the morning bus window plus marginal temps that can create isolated slick spots on bridges/overpasses. That combination can justify a delay if observed vis drops into true dense-fog territory (e.g., <0.25–0.5 mi broadly) or if spot-ice becomes widespread, but based on the provided hourly forecast it’s more likely the district mitigates with slower routes rather than closing. Net: low but non-zero closure probability, centered around ~6% (with delay probability notably higher)."

        "shiftReason": "From a news/decision-signals standpoint, nothing in the local information environment suggests Rockford Public Schools is preparing families for a closure on Tuesday 2026-02-17. The district has publicly reiterated that school resumes that day after mid-winter break, and there are no corroborating closure cues (neighboring districts, local-TV closings buzz, outages, or road-condition headlines) in the supplied scan. Given the weather setup (above freezing, no accumulating snow, minimal precip) the most plausible disruption mechanism is localized dense fog causing a *delay*—but absent a wider event signal (e.g., widespread sub-0.5 mile visibility reports + crashes + advisories), a full snow day remains unlikely. I land slightly above the meteorology-only ‘very low’ baseline because fog + near-freezing temps can produce last-minute caution decisions if early-morning observations deteriorate more than forecast."
