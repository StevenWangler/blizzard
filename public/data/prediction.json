The main operational issue is cold + patches of mist/fog reducing visibility to around 1 mile at times overnight/early morning, but winds are too light for blowing/drifting snow and there is no new accumulation to trigger plow/road hazards. Morning bus-hour conditions inferred from the coldest pre-dawn hours: temps ~3–4°F with wind chills roughly -5°F to -6°F, which is COLD but well above Michigan’s common closure thresholds (-15°F to -20°F, and especially the automatic trigger ≤ -20°F). Bottom line: a weather-related closure Monday is unlikely based on this dataset; primary risk is localized slick spots from refreeze and minor visibility reductions in mist, not snow load or ice accretion."

Main upside risk is not the forecasted Sunday weather itself, but carryover black ice from prior days (if any) plus very cold overnight temps. If roads are reported dry/clear Sunday night, I’d center a snow-day probability around ~3–7%; if there are known untreated slick spots/compact snow on backroads Sunday evening, that could push it closer to ~8–15% (more ‘delay’ risk than full closure)."

That alone puts Rockford in a very low closure regime historically (single digits). The only meaningful disagreement was how much to weight Monday-morning safety risk given the Sunday-vs-Monday hourly mismatch and a ~10°F wind-chill discrepancy between WeatherAPI and Weather.com.\n\nResolution: I treat Monday’s bus-hour wind chill as potentially colder than the API (safety-first), but the meteorologist’s Monday best estimate still keeps wind chill most likely around ~-6°F to -2°F and only a low chance of ≤-15°F, with a very low chance of ≤-20°F. Therefore, extreme-cold closure rules are NOT triggered.\n\nThat leaves patchy black ice/freezing fog as the key risk. Safety’s “moderate” risk level fits a *delay more than closure* pattern in West Michigan unless road checks find widespread glaze or visibility drops broadly to near-whiteout fog. Infrastructure and news signals do not show escalating conditions or a closure domino effect, and the power grid picture is stable.\n\nNet: I land slightly above the debate average (11%) at 12% to account for (a) the unresolved Monday-hourly verification gap and (b) the plausible freezing-fog/refreeze setup.
