    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Tuesday, January 13, 2026, temperatures run very close to freezing overnight (around 31°F) but rise into the mid‑30s (34–37°F) during the day. That gives roughly 8–10 hours below or right at 32°F in the pre‑dawn and early morning window, then a steady warming trend by late morning and afternoon.\n\nPrecipitation: The main steady precipitation waits until mid‑afternoon and evening. Forecast guidance shows 0.25\" of liquid, falling primarily as rain with a transition to light sleet 5–7 PM, after the typical school dismissal window. Model output gives essentially 0\" of accumulating snow, and any sleet appears light and short‑lived. This is not a classic Michigan snow‑day setup (no 4–6\"+ snow, no pre‑dawn heavy bursts).\n\nWind/visibility: Winds gust into the low‑ to mid‑20s mph range from the SSW–WSW, adding some bite to the cold, especially at the bus stop, but remaining below typical wind‑closure thresholds. Visibility holds near 6 miles; only mist and rain reduce it slightly. No dense fog or whiteout‑style snow is indicated.\n\nTiming vs. school operations: Overnight and morning hours (midnight–8 AM) are dry, just overcast/misty with temps right around 31–32°F. That supports mainly dry or just damp roads for the morning commute, with perhaps a few slick patches on untreated surfaces but nothing regionally crippling. The more impactful weather—moderate rain, then some light sleet—moves in mid‑ to late afternoon, after buses have run and roads have been treated by daytime crews. Because Michigan districts are accustomed to winter driving and the event is liquid‑dominant, this pattern does not strongly support canceling school.\n\nBottom line: Expect a raw, cloudy day with increasing wind and rain by afternoon and some mixed sleet in the early evening. From a snow‑day standpoint, hazards are below the usual closure threshold in West Michigan: low snow totals, marginal temperatures, no significant ice accretion signal, and the worst of the precipitation holding off until after the school day. Overall likelihood of a full snow/ice day is low, with normal operations or, at most, some caution advised for the late‑day commute."

School closures in this region for this time of year are most frequently tied to: (1) overnight/early-morning snow bursts that quickly lay down several inches, (2) significant freezing rain or ice glaze events, or (3) arctic outbreaks with wind chills below about -15°F.

      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s modestly higher terrain relative to downtown Grand Rapids can occasionally favor slightly more snow in marginal setups, but in this case modeled precip type is predominantly rain with surface temps at or above freezing; that pattern does not usually translate into hidden snow/ice at local high spots—more of a cold, wet pavement scenario."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Overall, this pattern historically produces an extremely low likelihood of a snow day in Rockford, Michigan. For Tuesday, 2026-01-13, temperatures stay near or above freezing (around 31–37°F), with no accumulating snow and only light sleet late day. Winds, while breezy, are not damaging, and wind chills remain in the 20s—nowhere near the roughly -15°F wind-chill threshold that has prompted cold-related closures in the region. Total liquid precipitation (~0.25\"), timing (heavier rain/sleet after typical school dismissal), and lack of any ice accretion signal all argue against major travel disruption during the morning commute and school hours.\n\nWhen comparing this to past mid-January events in west Michigan, this looks like a classic “raw, rainy, maybe briefly slushy” day rather than a snow day setup. Historically, days with similar profiles—temps hugging freezing but slightly above, plain rain dominant, no snow accumulation, no winter weather alerts—almost always see schools operate on a normal schedule. Adjusting for the time of year and local decision habits, the implied snow-day probability for Rockford Public Schools under a forecast like this is very low (on the order of a few percent or less), and much closer to a typical in-session winter day than to known closure scenarios driven by blizzards, ice storms, or dangerous arctic cold."

This suggests **marginal winter conditions**—slick roads are possible, especially later, but there is **no indication of a major snowstorm, blizzard, or extreme cold event** that would reliably trigger widespread pre‑announced closures.\n\nAdvisories/alerts: Recent **Winter Weather Advisories** from NWS Gaylord and NWS Grand Rapids targeted counties north and northwest of Kent and were in effect mainly through Sunday, Jan 11; they have **expired** and do not currently include Kent County for Jan 12–13.\n\nDistrict and neighbor signals: Public‑facing pages for Kent ISD‑area districts (including Lowell) and regional news feeds currently show **normal operations** and forward‑looking calendar items, without mention of weather‑related remote days, early dismissals, or Jan 13 closure planning. There are **no published closure lists or domino‑effect patterns** from Grand Rapids‑area neighbors for Jan 13 at this time.\n\nCommunity chatter & outages: Within the public web and news footprint checked (local media, district sites, regional context), there is **no notable social media or community chatter** specifically discussing Rockford, MI, road hazards, power outages, or anticipated snow days for Tuesday. No Consumers‑style outage reports or local event cancellations tied to weather on Jan 13 have surfaced.\n\nOverall, current open‑source signals support the idea that **Rockford Public Schools and surrounding districts are more likely than not to have school as usual on Tuesday, January 13, 2026**, unless the forecast deteriorates (especially if the icy mix timeline shifts earlier or intensifies) or new NWS advisories are issued later on Jan 12. Re‑checking local TV closings lists (WOOD TV8, WZZM 13, Fox 17), Kent ISD alerts, and Rockford Public Schools’ official channels this evening and early Tuesday morning will give the most accurate last‑minute picture."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflict check\n- Meteorology: Indicates a low chance of closure. Temps hover around freezing overnight, rise into mid-30s, with ~0\" snow and mainly rain. Morning (midnight–8 AM) is dry/overcast with maybe mist; heavier rain/light sleet comes 3–8 PM. Bottom line: not a snow-day setup.\n- History: Strongly reinforces that this pattern almost never leads to closures (2–3% historical snow-day rate) in Rockford/GR: rain-dominant, marginal temps, no alerts, no arctic cold. Calls it a classic “raw, rainy, maybe briefly slushy” school day.\n- Safety: Rates primary roads 8/10, secondaries and lots 7/10; morning commute impact minimal, afternoon moderate. Recommends normal in‑person school, with targeted salting and caution for slick spots and wet roads.\n- News/Community Intel: No advisories for Kent County for Jan 13, no Rockford/neighbor closures listed, no social-media buzz, and generic closings pages show no Jan 13 entries. Local forecast language describes a light icy mix later in the day, not a storm-level event.\n\nAll four experts agree: (a) this is not a significant snow or ice storm, (b) morning conditions are generally fine for school, and (c) the higher-impact weather is later in the day. There are no substantive conflicts—only nuance about a \"moderate\" but localized ice formation risk.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Snow/ice accumulation: Models show essentially 0\" snow and no meaningful ice accretion; risk is mainly brief slickness from marginal temps and wet surfaces.\n- Timing: Roads are mainly dry/damp overnight into the morning. Any mist or patchy black ice risk is around the 6–8 AM window but not widespread.\n- Buses start ~6–7 AM; school start ~7:30–8:00 AM. The more intense precip (heavier rain, then light sleet) ramps up around 3 PM and continues to ~7 PM.\n- That leaves essentially unlimited time between the end of anything marginally icy and the morning commute, and the worst conditions come after dismissal when crews can actively treat surfaces. This is not a case where plows need hours to clear 4–8\" of snow; instead it is standard winter wet-road management.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Temperatures: around 31°F early, then into the mid‑30s. That supports possible spotty slickness on bridges, untreated secondary roads, and shaded lots pre‑dawn, but a warming trend reduces risk as the morning progresses.\n- Precip type: \"Mixed\" overall, but specifically rain-dominant with a short light sleet window late afternoon/early evening. No modeled ice accretion and no freezing rain signature.\n- Safety analyst: Flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but still recommends normal school with targeted salting and bus driver awareness. That indicates nuisance to moderate slick spots, not system-wide hazardous ice.\n\nGiven that Michigan thresholds treat 8+\" or true icing as a 60–85% closure setup, the complete absence of accumulating snow and of a true freezing-rain event keeps this day far below typical closure criteria.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news intel\n- Neighboring district closures list: Empty for Jan 13; no entries in closings aggregators, no Rockford or Kent ISD‑area neighbors calling off.\n- NWS and local TV: No current winter weather advisory/warning for Kent County for Jan 13.\n- Community sentiment: \"no_buzz\"—people are not talking about a snow day or major storm.\n\nPer the weighting rules, News Intel is a key factor: if neighbors were closing, we would add 15–20% to the probability, but we have the opposite: zero signals of closure. This strongly supports staying near the low end of the Michigan threshold ranges.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (explicit)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly points to non-event for closures (low hazard in pre‑dawn, worse weather later). If taken alone, this suggests perhaps ~5–10% closure probability, driven only by low‑probability surprise icing.\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as safe enough for normal operations with precautions. Implied closure chance around ~5–10%—only if ice is worse than expected.\n- History (20%): Past analogs show ~2–3% closure rate. This pulls the blended probability down toward the very low single digits.\n- News Intel (20%): No neighboring closures, no advisories, no chatter. This behaves like a strong negative signal, keeping us near the historical baseline rather than bumping us up the way active closure lists would.\n\nBlending these: \n- Meteorology: ~8% * 0.35 ≈ 2.8\n- Safety: ~8% * 0.25 ≈ 2.0\n- History: ~3% * 0.20 ≈ 0.6\n- News Intel: ~5% * 0.20 ≈ 1.0\nSum ≈ 6.4%, rounded to a decisive 7% to acknowledge small upside risk from an unexpected earlier or stronger icy mix.\n\n6. Why not higher (e.g., 15–30%)?\n- Michigan closure thresholds emphasize significant snow totals (4–6\"+) or ice/blizzard-level impacts. We have 0\" snow and no ice storm.\n- No winter weather alerts, no neighboring closures, and normal historical behavior in such setups argue strongly against anything in the moderate-probability range.\n- The plow/salt demands are routine; infrastructure is built for this.\n\n7. What would make this prediction wrong?\nKey failure modes:\n- The light icy mix arrives **several hours earlier** than forecast, creating widespread freezing rain or significant sleet accumulation starting before 5–6 AM rather than mid/late afternoon.\n- Surface temperatures run **1–3°F colder** than forecast, causing a flash ice event even with modest QPF, especially if untreated roads glaze over.\n- A late-day NWS advisory is issued for **freezing rain or significant ice accretion** centered on Kent County.\n- A domino effect of closures develops among neighboring Kent ISD/GR metro districts tonight, signaling a risk perception shift not captured in current data.\nAny of these would justify materially raising the probability into at least the 25–40% range or higher.\n\n8. Final decision\nGiven strong multi-expert agreement, routine winter conditions for Michigan, low historical closure rates for this exact setup, and no peer-district closure signals, the best calibrated forecast is a **7% probability of a snow/ice day** for Rockford Public Schools on Tuesday, January 13, 2026. Normal school operations are expected, with attention to localized slick spots and a wetter, sloppier afternoon commute.",
