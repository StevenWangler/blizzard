Temperatures rise from the mid-20s overnight to around 29°F by mid-morning and near 50°F in the afternoon, so road temperatures should improve quickly after sunrise. The only notable school-operations hazard is freezing fog around the morning bus window (roughly 7–9 AM), with visibility near 1 mile and temps in the mid-20s—this can create localized slick spots on bridges/untreated surfaces from fog deposition. Winds are modest (generally 6–12 mph, gusts up to ~15–17 mph in the day), producing morning wind chills around 17–20°F—NOT near Michigan cold-closure thresholds (≤ -20°F). Net: expect a normal school day; closure probability is very low, with only a small risk of minor delays or extra caution messaging due to patchy freezing fog/black ice potential."

News intel finds no Rockford or neighboring-district closure/delay signals—an important tiebreaker in Michigan where domino closures often precede broad shutdowns.\n\nThe one meaningful conflict is precipitation guidance: WeatherAPI shows 0\" precip/snow, while Weather.com displays hints of light snow showers and even 1–3\" on its 10-day page. The meteorologist follow-up still supports the ‘dry/near-dry’ solution (only ~5% snow probability, 0\" accumulation). Because even a brief, unexpected snow shower or thin glaze during 6–9 AM can spike crash risk, I keep a non-trivial tail risk—but not enough to overcome Michigan’s high closure threshold.\n\nBottom line: Expect Rockford to be OPEN, possibly with extra caution messaging; a 2-hour delay is more plausible than a full closure if fog is thicker than forecast or if spotty glazing is observed on bridges/rural connectors. I set 12% for a full snow-day closure to account for the cross-model precip discrepancy and fog/ice micro-risk, while still optimizing for Michigan’s typical ‘stay open unless widespread hazard’ reality.",
