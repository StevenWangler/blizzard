The only reason this isn’t near-zero is the antecedent mention of light freezing rain/snow earlier in the weekend: if a thin glaze lingers on untreated back roads and refreezes hard by Monday pre-dawn, you can get a surprise delay/closure. Without evidence of significant ice accumulation Sunday night into Monday morning, I’d calibrate Rockford’s Monday closure probability at ~4% (delay maybe ~8–12%), with high confidence that it’s a normal operating day unless residual ice reports spike."

However, the Weather.com signal is inconsistent across caches/locales (about -17°F vs -26°F), and we do not have a dedicated Monday 6–8 AM NWS/Weather.gov value in the provided packet, so the forecast certainty is not high enough to go straight to 90–95%.\n\nGiven (1) no snow/ice expected to force a closure on its own, (2) no neighboring-district domino effect yet, and (3) only moderate/scattered outage risk—but (4) a safety-significant chance that wind chills are in the -20°F-or-colder range—I’m setting a mid-high probability that reflects the ‘cold-triggered closure’ being the primary path.
