    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Monday, 2025-12-01, the storm has largely moved out. After heavy snow and hazardous travel through Sunday morning, conditions on Monday are cold but relatively quiet. Temperatures stay in the upper teens to upper 20s with wind chills in the teens, but remain below freezing all day, so existing snow and slush will stay frozen and roads may be slick in spots, especially untreated/secondary roads and bridges. However, there is essentially no accumulating snow or ice during the overnight leading into the Monday morning commute: skies are mostly clear to partly cloudy overnight with temps around 18–20°F and light winds; visibility improves to around 6–10 miles except for some localized mist. During school hours (7 AM–3 PM), it is cloudy and dry with temps climbing from the upper teens to upper 20s, light S–SSE winds under 10 mph, and no snow falling. Light snow returns only late in the evening (after ~9 PM) with modest rates and limited additional accumulation (~0.25\" total). Given Michigan’s high tolerance and the timing (storm impact primarily Saturday–Sunday, not Monday morning), the risk of a full snow day or widespread closure on Monday is low. Some districts might opt for patchy delays if Sunday plowing was incomplete and side roads are still rough, but based on this forecast alone, roads should be plowed and passable by early Monday and conditions do not warrant a typical Michigan snow day."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, Monday, 2025-12-01 in Rockford, MI looks like a classic post-storm school day rather than a high-risk closure day. The Winter Storm Warning and heavy snow are focused on Saturday 11/29 through Sunday 11/30, with additional 6–12\" and blowing snow—but that warning ends at 10 AM Sunday, giving road crews the rest of Sunday plus overnight to clear major routes.\n\nKey points for Monday’s school decision:\n- Snowfall/timing: The Monday daytime period (including the morning commute) is essentially dry—totalsnow_cm for the day is under 1 cm, and the only notable snow in the hourly data appears after 9 PM Monday. That is far removed from both the Monday morning start and afternoon dismissal windows.\n- Temperatures: Morning lows in the teens (around 17–19°F) with wind chills in the low teens are cold but typical for early December. They are well above the ~-15°F wind-chill threshold where many Michigan districts start to seriously consider cold-related closures.\n- Wind and visibility: Winds are light to moderate (generally under 10 mph), with good visibility during core school hours. There is no indication of blizzard conditions, strong blowing/drifting, or sub–¼ mile visibility during the commute.\n- Precipitation/ice risk: No freezing rain or mixed precip is forecast on Monday. Surfaces may be snow-covered or slushy from the weekend, but with temps in the 20s and ongoing treatment, that is usually manageable.\n\nHistorically in Michigan—and specifically in Kent County districts like Rockford—schools almost never close for a quiet, cold, post-storm day when:\n- The main heavy snow has already fallen more than 12–24 hours before school start,\n- No additional significant snow, ice, or high winds are forecast during the bus window, and\n- Wind chills remain above dangerous thresholds.\n\nThe more common closure pattern here is either (1) heavy snow or ice actively ongoing in the early morning hours with poor visibility and rapidly worsening roads, or (2) extreme cold/wind chill. Monday’s forecast does not match either of those patterns.\n\nGiven those historical patterns and the specific forecast numbers, the post-storm cleanup context slightly raises the chance of a delay or isolated bus-route issues, but the overall probability of a full district-wide snow day on Monday, 2025-12-01 appears low. The JSON above reflects this by aligning Monday with historical analogues where schools generally stayed open after a major weekend storm, once plows had a day to recover and no new hazard was impacting the commute."

    "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON\n- Meteorology: Storm is largely done before Monday; Monday morning is dry, cold, and calm with maybe a trace of snow much later at night.\n- History: This setup matches a classic Michigan ‘post‑storm school day’ where schools almost always open—heavy weekend storm, then quieter Monday.\n- Safety: Road scores are solid (8/10 primary, 7/10 secondary, 7/10 parking lots), ‘morning_commute_impact: minimal’, overall risk level LOW.\n- News/Intel: Rockford’s own site says ‘Return Monday, December 1’, with no weather caveats; no neighboring districts are signaling closures; coverage focuses on weekend travel, not Monday hazards.\nConsensus: Monday morning looks like a normal, cold Michigan winter day with some residual slick spots, not a snow‑day setup.\n\n2. WHERE THEY DISAGREE\n- There is only mild tension, not real conflict:\n  - Meteorology flags 24 hours below freezing → some residual slickness.\n  - Safety calls ice risk ‘moderate’, but still labels overall risk ‘low’ and commute impact ‘minimal’.\n  - History notes 6–12\" over the weekend but points out that when plows get 12–24 hours before school, closure rates stay around 5–15%.\n  - News/Intel finds no closure signals or neighboring shutdowns.\nNo expert is arguing for high closure odds; the debate is really “very low” vs “low” probability, not “open” vs “almost certainly closed.”\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Heavy snow & Winter Storm Warning: focused on SAT–SUN, with the warning ending 10:00 AM SUNDAY.\n- School start: ~7:40 AM MONDAY.\n- Elapsed time from warning end to school start: roughly 21.5 hours.\n- There is no meaningful accumulating snow overnight into Monday (only ~0.25\" late Monday night). That gives:\n  - All day Sunday + Sunday night + pre‑dawn Monday for plows to clear primary and most secondary roads.\nIn Michigan, 20+ hours of dry time after a storm—without new accumulation—is usually more than enough for roads to be in ‘school open’ shape, especially in a well‑equipped county like Kent.\n\n4. ICE CHECK\n- Temps: teens to 20s, staying below freezing → refreeze and some black ice possible.\n- But: No freezing rain or mixed precip is forecast; Monday is dry during commute with light winds and no active precipitation.\n- Safety labels ice formation risk as ‘moderate’, not high; road scores remain good.\nConclusion: There will be slick spots and frozen slush, but not an ice storm or widespread glaze. Under the given thresholds, that does NOT push this into an ‘ice changes everything’ 60–85% or 80–95% category.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- Explicitly noted: No public closure announcements yet for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, or Greenville for Monday Dec 1.\n- No joint ISD message hinting at pre‑planned closures or coordinated snow day.\nPer your own rules: ‘3+ neighboring districts closed = +15–20%’. Right now that adjustment is 0%; all signals say ‘planning to open.’\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nI’d be wrong (probability too low) if one or more of these happen:\n- Plow operations are seriously delayed Sunday (equipment failure, staffing, or much higher actual totals) leaving rural side roads and bus turnarounds truly impassable by 5–6 AM Monday.\n- A band of unexpected lake‑effect snow sets up overnight Sunday into early Monday over northern Kent County, dropping several additional inches during the bus window (not in the current forecast).\n- Hidden ice issues are worse than expected (e.g., melting on Sunday followed by a sharp refreeze causing widespread black ice on hills and shaded curves) and transportation officials decide conditions are unsafe for buses.\nI’d be wrong in the other direction (probability too high) only if cleanup is flawless and roads are essentially dry and bare everywhere—i.e., if Rockford would never consider closing in such conditions.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Very low risk for active weather during school hours. Suggests a routine cold day with residual snowpack. → Pushes probability into the 5–15% band.\n- Safety (25%): Labels overall risk ‘low’, commute impact ‘minimal’, and road scores 7–8/10, with moderate but manageable ice risk. → Supports the low end of snow‑day probabilities.\n- History (20%): Analog patterns for ‘Monday after a weekend warning’ show 0.05–0.15 closure frequency. Seasonal adjustment is slightly downward (-0.1 qualitatively), reinforcing that Michigan usually runs school in this setup. → Anchors around ~10%.\n- News & Community Intel (20% – your ‘secret weapon’):\n  - No neighboring closures, no district hints of concern, no community drumbeat expecting a snow day.\n  - The district has publicly committed to ‘Return Monday’ as of the analysis time with no caveats.\nPer your rules, we only bump up if neighbors close or community expects closure. Here, neither is true, so this bloc actually supports staying near the historical/meteorological low base rate.\n\nNUMERICAL DECISION\n- Michigan thresholds:\n  - <4\" new snow (and no ice storm) → 5–15% is normal. Monday effectively has 0\" new snow for the commute; all accumulation is earlier.\n  - No blizzard, no active storm, no extreme cold.\n- Blending:\n  - Meteorology suggests ~10–15%.\n  - Safety suggests ~10%.\n  - History: 5–15%, mid ~10%.\n  - News/Intel: no upward adjustment; if anything keeps us from drifting higher.\nAveraging these, and then respecting that conditions are very typical for ‘open with caution,’ I land at an 11% probability of a full district‑wide snow day for Rockford on Monday, Dec 1, 2025.\n\nThis stays inside your Michigan guideline band for <4\" snow (5–15%), avoids the 40–60% ‘mushy middle,’ and reflects strong cross‑expert agreement that school is very likely to be in session.",
