Winds from the WNW stay breezy (15–25 mph, gusts to mid‑30s), keeping wind chills in the teens and allowing some blowing/drifting in open areas. The worst visibility is associated with earlier lake‑effect bands (near-zero at times overnight and early morning), but forecast conditions trend toward more stable 4–10 mile visibility tonight and Friday with no new accumulating precip. For a Michigan school context, this setup supports slick and locally hazardous roads today and for the Thursday evening commute, but conditions are improving and plows/salt have ample time to work before Friday morning. Overall likelihood of a classic full snow day for Rockford Public Schools on Friday, Nov 28, is low; at most, minor localized delays are possible where lake‑effect bands were strongest or where freezing drizzle left a thin glaze, but widespread closure is unlikely."

True ‘big’ winter storms (8–12\"+ widespread synoptic snow or brutal arctic cold) become more common in December and January. At this point in the season, schools in West Michigan have a long history of staying open through advisory‑level events, treating them as fairly routine.",

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast and alerts, this setup strongly resembles a routine late‑November lake‑effect/advisory event for Rockford rather than a classic Michigan snow‑day pattern. Temperatures, while cold, are not anywhere near the extreme wind‑chill threshold (‑15°F or lower). Forecast snow amounts near Rockford appear modest (on the order of a couple of inches, possibly a bit more if a band lingers), and winds, while gusty, are not at blizzard or whiteout‑level for an extended period over the district itself. Historically, Rockford and other Kent County districts rarely close for this combination alone—light to moderate lake‑effect snow, advisory‑level impacts, and sub‑freezing but not dangerously cold wind chills—especially once winter operations are in full swing and road crews are active. Closures in this region more often occur with (1) widespread 8–10\"+ overnight or early‑morning snow with poor timing, (2) true blizzard conditions with sustained whiteouts, or (3) severe arctic outbreaks with wind chills below about ‑15°F. This event, as described, falls below those traditional closure triggers. Therefore, using historical analogs and Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather, the implied snow‑day probability from these conditions would be on the low side, and I have medium confidence in that assessment, acknowledging that highly localized bands or poor timing on specific back roads can still lead to rare exceptions."

    "decision_rationale": "Synthesizing the three expert views, this is a textbook advisory-level Michigan lake-effect setup, not a high-probability snow-day pattern. Meteorology: Total new snow in Kent County is only about 1–2\" with light mixed precip and breezy WNW winds. Visibility extremes are tied to earlier bands, with a trend toward 4–10 miles and no fresh accumulating snow heading into Friday morning. Thermally, we stay below freezing but not near dangerous wind-chill thresholds. Historical patterns: Past events that look like this—late-November, advisory-level lake-effect, 1–3\" snow, gusty winds, but heavier action mainly west/south of Kent—yield about 10–25% snow-day rates, and Rockford specifically is known to hold school under these conditions once winter operations are up and running. Seasonal context and infrastructure both point to this being treated as routine winter weather. Safety: Road condition scores (around 5–6/10) and a ‘moderate’ risk label indicate slick but manageable travel, especially once plows and salt have worked through the 27th. The worst period for impacts is overnight through the morning of the 27th, not during the morning of the 28th when school would run. The safety assessment explicitly expects ‘normal school operations’ on the 28th. Given Michigan’s higher closure thresholds and the sub‑4\" accumulation, this lands squarely in the 5–15% guidance band. I’m setting the probability at 14% to reflect a small but non‑negligible chance that localized black ice or a persistent band over rural routes could trigger an unexpected closure or rare delay, while still emphasizing that a snow day is unlikely.",
