      "Because temps stay well below freezing (roughly 13°F overnight, rising to mid-20s), any leftover moisture from prior days, drifting/compaction, or overnight refreeze on treated surfaces can create surprise slick patches on secondary/rural roads and subdivision streets.",
      "Bus ops: routes should be runnable, but instruct drivers to treat the first 30–60 minutes as an ‘ice check’ period—reduced speeds, longer following distance, and extra caution at known trouble spots (low-lying areas, bridge decks, hill crests, and stop-controlled intersections).",
      "Walking students: wind chills are the bigger safety concern than roads. Around the core bus pickup window (about 6–8 AM), wind chills are near ~+2°F (teens air temp with ~5–10 mph wind). Not an automatic extreme-cold closure threshold, but it increases risk for kids waiting if buses run late—recommend reminders about covering exposed skin and limiting wait time.",
      "Parking lots/drop-off loops: likely some hard-pack/ice in untreated corners since there’s no melting cycle. Recommend spot-salting of entrances, bus loops, and parent drop-off crosswalk zones before 6 AM.",
      "Decision guidance (Michigan-calibrated): with no falling snow, light winds, and temps in the teens/20s, this looks like a normal winter operating day. A full closure would be unlikely unless there is verified widespread black ice or an unreported flash-freeze event from Sunday evening moisture.",
      "What could change the call: reports of widespread icy travel on Sunday night (Feb 8) into early Monday, or any surprise freezing drizzle/fog depositing rime/ice—those would push risk up quickly even without snow."

However, the web cross-check in this tool run returned only Weather.com cached hourly pages, and they conflict heavily (showing much warmer temps and even rain/showers/snow showers in different cached variants). I was NOT able to reliably retrieve Weather.gov (NWS point forecast), AccuWeather RealFeel, or a local TV meteorologist page with explicit Rockford hourly wind-chill for Mon 2/9 within the tool results returned. Because of these conflicts and missing primary confirmations, the only internally-consistent dataset here is your WeatherAPI feed, which does NOT approach the -20°F automatic-closure wind chill threshold.",

The only meaningful uncertainty is second-order: isolated black ice from residual moisture (bridge decks, shaded dips, rural connectors) plus a small operational tail risk from scattered Kent County power outages. News intel did not find any Feb 9 closure/delay announcements for Rockford or nearby districts, and there’s no closure cascade developing. Web verification flagged large discrepancies in cached Weather.com temperatures, but importantly found no credible ≤ -20°F wind chill during 6–8 AM; therefore the extreme-cold automatic closure rules do not apply. Given Michigan’s high threshold for calling off school and the lack of a storm/ice driver, a full closure remains unlikely; the main practical outcome is ‘open’ with early-morning monitoring for slick spot reports and building power/heat status.",

Snow-day decisions are typically dominated by accumulating snow/ice during the early commute or by extreme wind chills; neither is indicated here. The bus window wind chills around +1 to +3°F are uncomfortable but not close to the kinds of thresholds that usually drive closures in Michigan. Therefore, the closure probability from weather alone is very low; I’m holding a small residual probability for surprise slick spots/black ice (dependent on what happened prior to this forecast window) or a forecast bust."

None of those are present in the provided WeatherAPI forecast for Monday, Feb 9, 2026. Cold temps and light winds by themselves have historically produced very few full closures in this region.\n\nSo I’m keeping the base snow-day probability in the low single digits, but not zero. I’m adding a small upward adjustment to account for: (1) the Safety/Infrastructure teams’ note about isolated-to-possibly-widespread black ice risk if there was moisture before the cold set in, and (2) the power-outage tail risk noted by NEWS/POWERGRID (if a building is in an outage pocket, closure odds jump regardless of weather). Net: low, but non-trivial tail risk."

The credible hazards are (1) localized black ice during the pre-sunrise commute and (2) cold exposure at stops if transportation runs behind schedule. Those typically lead to heightened caution or, at most, a delay—not a full closure—unless there are verified widespread crashes/ice reports. I’m keeping the probability above ‘near-zero’ mainly because of the outage wildcard and the possibility of unreported refreeze from prior weekend moisture."

The provided forecast for Monday, Feb 9, 2026 is cold but quiet—overcast, no snow/rain, light winds—so I don’t expect a closure cascade. The only plausible “surprise” pathway is localized black ice from earlier moisture or a building-level power outage that can’t be resolved before morning. Those risks justify a small but non-zero probability, but not a high one."
