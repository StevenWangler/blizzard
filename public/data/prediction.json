The key for a snow day is timing: the forecast is mostly quiet during prime bus hours (6–7 AM) with mist/low visibility at times, then a burst of snow develops after start time (around 8 AM, another heavier burst near 11 AM). Total snow for the day is only about 3.2 cm (~1.3 in), which is well within normal Michigan operations. No extreme wind chills are indicated for 6–8 AM (wind chill roughly ~20F), far from the -15F to -20F closure triggers. Main operational impacts are localized slick spots from light snow plus reduced visibility (down to ~1 mile) in mist/snow bursts—more likely a ‘slow commute’ than a closure. Overall: schools very likely OPEN; at most, monitor for a minor delay if visibility is persistently poor at 6:30–7:30 AM, but snowfall amount/timing does not support a classic Michigan snow day."

If that happens, the closure risk can jump into the ~25% range even with low storm totals; if roads are merely wet/salted with minor slush, closure risk drops below ~10%."

      "In Michigan, MDOT/county routes should be in decent shape by start time if treatment is effective; however, **subdivision/low-volume roads and rural connectors** may remain slick longer—these are where bus routes get compromised first.",
      "Have transportation do **pre-dawn test runs** (or staff spot-checks) on known problem segments: shaded curves, bridge decks, and hill approaches; be ready to **modify/skip a few stops** on steep or unpaved roads if they’re icy.",
      "Operational mitigations if open: delay bus pickups 10–20 minutes, enforce reduced-speed routes, no tight-turn shortcuts, and ensure extra spacing at rail crossings and stop-controlled intersections.",
      "Parking lots/drop-off lanes: expect **compacted snow + hidden ice** after the morning snow burst; prioritize salting the bus loop, ADA access, and main parent drop-off lanes first.",

That is well above the -20°F automatic-closure wind chill threshold. However, the web cross-check in this run could not reliably validate the Feb 6 hour-by-hour 'feels like' because Weather.com results returned in search snippets appear to be for late January dates (and some international locale variants), not the target date. The one non-WeatherAPI web source that did align cleanly to the Rockford 49341 area (weatherUSA) indicates an Extreme Cold Warning and a Winter Weather Advisory, suggesting impactful conditions are possible in the broader period—but it does not provide a clearly time-stamped Feb 6 6–8 AM wind chill in the captured snippet. Net: no credible web source in this scrape confirms wind chill ≤ -20°F for Fri 2026-02-06 6–8 AM in Rockford, MI; the only ≤ -20°F values found were on Weather.com pages that appear to reference different dates and thus cannot be used as the trigger.",

Safety and infrastructure add a meaningful operational concern: even modest freezing rain/freezing drizzle (likely trace to <0.01\" generally, with pockets 0.01–0.05\" on bridges/untreated residential) can create outsized crash/bus-stop risk during 6:45–9:15 AM, especially if a fresh coating of snow begins around 8 AM and hides slick spots. However, there is no confirmed widespread closure domino effect yet, and power outages are not a driver.

Those ingredients often lead districts to prefer a delay over a full closure.

The modeled snowfall amount (~1.3\") and peak hourly snow (~0.4\"/hr) are typically manageable for Michigan districts, especially if the heaviest rates are brief and not preceded by a major overnight accumulation.\n\nThe main “snow day” pathway here is not totals, but a thin glaze/black-ice situation plus a quick burst that drops visibility and rapidly coats secondary roads right as buses are running (roughly 7:30–9:00 AM). That supports some non-trivial closure risk, but more often points to a delay/modified transportation rather than a full closure.\n\nNet: I land near the low-to-mid teens for full closure (snow day), with a higher separate probability for a delay (not requested here)."

Full closures more often correlate with larger overnight totals, persistent heavy rates during the entire commute window, widespread ice, or major blowing/drifting—none of which are strongly indicated here.\n\nWhat moves this up from ~10–12% into the high-teens is the combination of (1) reduced visibility/mist around daybreak, (2) potential thin-glaze/black-ice risk from the prior evening’s freezing-rain signal and refreeze, and (3) the “administrative memory” of very recent closures in the area, which can make the district less willing to gamble on marginal conditions."

Those ingredients often lead districts to prefer a delay over a full closure. I’m therefore above the History agent’s ~15% closure baseline, but still well below 50% because the forecast accumulation and wind are not extreme and major roads should be treated. Net: low-to-moderate closure risk, with a higher probability of delay than cancellation."

Right now, the best available “what will they do?” indicators point to **no decision yet** and **no active closings**, which keeps full-closure probability relatively low. However, the combination of (a) a messy overnight wintry mix risk, (b) reduced visibility/mist around the morning window, and (c) very recent (Thursday) closure precedent raises the tail risk above a typical 1-inch snowfall day. Net: I land at **18%** for a full snow day (closure) for Friday 2026-02-06, with a meaningfully higher chance of a **delay** if morning road checks find patch ice on secondary roads."
