Temperatures hover near 30°F overnight with wind chills in the teens, then rise slightly above freezing (max around 35°F) during the afternoon. Forecast guidance shows zero measurable precipitation (rain or snow) and no icing risk: all hourly data for the overnight, morning commute (6–9 AM), and school day stays dry. Winds are breezy from the southwest (generally 10–16 mph with higher gusts), producing a noticeable chill but not approaching damaging or blizzard criteria. Visibility remains around 6 miles with only clouds and no fog or snow to reduce it. Existing Sunday winter weather advisories and special statements end on January 11 and are tied to earlier lake-effect snow and freezing rain, not to Monday. Roads may be somewhat slick in spots early if leftover patches from Sunday persist, but with no new snow or ice and ample time for plows/salt to work, Rockford Public Schools are very unlikely to call a snow day. Overall, this is a routine cold, partly cloudy January day in Michigan with a near-zero probability of weather-related closure for Monday 1/12."

Historically, Michigan districts in this area almost never close for this combination of factors alone; closures are usually reserved for active snowstorms with poor visibility and 8–10+ inches, significant freezing rain/ice, blizzard conditions, or dangerous cold (sub -15°F wind chill). The prior day’s advisory and light freezing rain are likely to result in some lingering slick spots but with ample time for treatment before the Monday commute. Overall confidence is high that, based on historical patterns and local practices, the probability of a snow day on 2026-01-12 under this forecast is very low."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology: Clear and dry for Rockford on Monday 1/12, with 0\" new snow, no freezing rain, and no visibility issues. Wind chills are in the teens, not extreme.\n- History: Past patterns with nearly identical conditions (dry, near 30°F, prior light event) yield a 1–5% closure rate, with high confidence that schools usually stay open.\n- Safety: Road and travel risk is rated low (primary roads 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10). Morning and afternoon commute impacts are both labeled minimal.\n- News/Intel: Rockford and neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no closures or delays posted for Monday. Coverage emphasizes a weekend system ending Sunday, not a Monday storm.\nAll four experts agree that: (a) there is no active storm Monday, (b) conditions are typical for Michigan winter, and (c) there is no strong signal toward a closure. There are no significant conflicts among the experts.\n\n2. Plow timing math\nSunday’s light snow/freezing rain and advisory conditions taper by Sunday midday/afternoon. That gives roughly 12–18+ hours before the Monday 7:40 AM start for plows and salt to work, with no new overnight precipitation. With temps near 28–30°F and traffic on main routes, that window is ample for Kent County crews to return primary and most secondary roads to safe condition. The safety analyst’s scores (8–9/10) are consistent with this.\n\n3. Ice risk\nMeteorology explicitly indicates no new freezing rain or drizzle overnight and zero precipitation for the commute. Safety flags only a moderate risk of refreeze on untreated spots (bridges, shaded bends, low-volume side roads). This is localized black-ice potential, not a district-wide ice event. Historically, Rockford and similar Michigan districts stay open under these conditions, using driver cautions rather than cancellation.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\nNews intelligence confirms: no early closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts, no Monday-focused advisories for Kent County, and no widespread power/road crises. Community sentiment is described as uncertain but not alarmed, and coverage is past-tense about the weekend storm. Per the weighting rules, we would only increase the closure probability by 15–20% if multiple neighboring districts were already closed; here, they are not, so no upward adjustment is warranted.\n\n5. Weighting of experts\n- Meteorology (35%): Dominant signal is a dry, cold, normal winter day with no new snow or ice and decent visibility. This strongly pulls the probability toward the very low end (~1–3%).\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, high road scores, and minimal commute impact further support a very low closure probability, consistent with meteorology.\n- History (20%): Analog days show approximately 1–5% closure rates. This narrows the plausible band to the low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closure chatter, no posted closures, and no Monday advisory for Rockford all confirm that local decision-makers are not preparing for a snow day.\nBalancing these, a 3% probability best matches the integrated signal: above absolute zero to acknowledge small residual-ice uncertainty, but squarely in the 5–15% Michigan guideline band for <4\" snow—here with 0\" new snow and only leftover slick spots.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nThe main ways this 3% estimate could fail are:\n- An unforeseen localized icing issue overnight (e.g., freezing fog or a mis-forecast patch of light freezing drizzle) creating much more black ice than expected on key bus routes.\n- A last-minute, non-meteorological factor (significant bus mechanical issues, staffing shortages, or unrelated emergencies) causing closure despite benign weather.\nGiven current data and typical Rockford practice, both are low-probability scenarios.\n\nOverall conclusion: With no new snow, no ice storm, and only isolated refreeze risk after a modest Sunday event, Rockford Public Schools are overwhelmingly likely to operate on a normal schedule Monday, January 12, 2026.",
