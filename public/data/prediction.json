Not an “ice storm” setup, but enough for isolated slick spots.",

However, this verification pass could not extract authoritative Monday-specific hourly wind chill values from the NWS point forecast page nor AccuWeather RealFeel, and Wunderground’s Monday hourly details were not accessible due to JavaScript limitations—so while there is no evidence of ≤-20°F wind chill for Monday morning, the web cross-check coverage is not complete.",

Web verification does not show any ≤ -20°F wind chill signal; both API and Weather.com sanity check keep feels-like in the single digits above zero, so the extreme-cold automatic-closure rules are not triggered. Infrastructure expectations are routine (no plowable snow), and power-outage risk is very low. The only plausible disruption pathway is local and late-breaking: pockets of reduced visibility (modeled ~1 mile, not dense-fog territory) and patchy black ice that depends on antecedent moisture from prior days/weekend (regional ice issues were noted on Fri 2/6, but no Monday-specific hazard is confirmed). In Michigan operations, those factors more often produce extra caution or, at most, a targeted delay—not a district-wide closure.

That removes the dominant snow-day triggers (accumulating snow, freezing rain/drizzle, strong wind/drifting, or extreme wind chills). The hourly forecast does flirt with reduced visibility (~1 mile) overnight into early morning, which can elevate accident risk on rural bus routes—so I can’t go to 0%. But absent a sign of freezing drizzle or rapidly worsening fog, the most likely outcome is a normal school day; at most, a localized/brief delay scenario. Net: ~2% chance of a closure (“snow day”), slightly higher (~5% as noted) for a delay, but the question here is full snow-day closure."

Historically, that points strongly toward “open,” with only a small tail risk for a closure driven by *unforecast* localized hazards (black ice from prior moisture, or fog that becomes unusually dense and widespread). I land at **3%** to reflect that small-but-real operational tail risk while staying consistent with the dry, low-wind setup and the meteorology peer estimate."

That strongly favors normal operations. The only realistic safety-driven disruption mechanisms are (a) **patchy black ice** from leftover moisture and (b) **pockets of reduced visibility** (forecast down to ~1 mile) during the early-morning transportation window. Those factors can justify a targeted caution message or, less commonly, a delay if conditions verify worse than forecast (e.g., widespread dense fog <0.5 mile or confirmed slick secondary roads on early route checks). A full closure is unlikely absent an unmodeled freezing drizzle/fog icing scenario Sunday night. Net: low single-digit closure odds, with “delay” more plausible than “snow day.”"

None of those are present here for Rockford, MI for Monday 2026-02-09.\n\nGiven the provided forecast (dry, light winds) and the lack of any emerging closure chatter in official channels, a full closure looks unlikely. The remaining plausible pathway is a *late-breaking* decision Monday pre-dawn if staff road-checks find widespread black ice or unexpectedly dense fog on rural routes—typically a delay outcome. I therefore land slightly above the meteorology agent’s 1–3% closure estimate, but still very low overall at ~3%."
