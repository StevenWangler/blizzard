Roads will be cold but dry, so no accumulating snow or glazing from ongoing precipitation, and any residual moisture from prior days is minimal with no signal for freezing drizzle.

Visibility is generally good (~5–6 miles) with only localized reductions to ~1 mile in the evening fog/mist, well after the morning commute.

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast for Wednesday, 2025-12-17, the conditions are well below typical closure thresholds used by Michigan districts: \n- Temperatures: Lows near 30°F, highs mid-30s°F with wind chills generally in the low 20s during the morning. This is far from the extreme cold threshold (around -15°F wind chill or colder) that has historically forced many West Michigan districts to close.\n- Precipitation: The forecast shows 0.0 mm precip and 0.0 cm of snow for the day, with hourly ‘will_it_snow’ and ‘will_it_rain’ at 0% for all school commute hours. No ice, no accumulating snow, and no mixed precip are indicated.\n- Wind and visibility: Winds are breezy overnight and early morning (sustained 17–20 mph with gusts up to ~30 mph), but this is a common winter pattern and does not approach damaging-wind or blizzard criteria. Visibility is generally 6–10 miles, with only brief 2-mile readings in the evening, so no whiteout or widespread fog issues are evident.\n- Alerts: The forecast contains no weather alerts or warnings for Rockford.\n\nWhen we compare this to historical closure triggers in Michigan—8–10\"+ of poorly timed snow, ice storms, blizzard/near-blizzard conditions, or wind chills well below zero—this pattern is markedly benign. It matches many ordinary mid-December school days with clouds, some wind, and seasonable cold but without hazardous travel.\n\nOverall, the historical analogs for a dry, overcast, breezy day around freezing in Rockford show essentially a 0% snow day rate. Confidence is high that, based solely on the weather provided, this would not lead to a school closure and would be considered a routine winter school day for this area and time of year."

    "decision_rationale": "1) EXPERT AGREEMENT CHECK\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Explicitly states 0\" snow, 0% precip, no ice issues, and concludes the likelihood of closure is effectively 0%.\n- Historian (20% weight): Multiple strong analogs with a historical snow day rate of 0%; describes this as a normal mid‑December school day for West Michigan.\n- Safety Analyst (25% weight): Rates risk level as low; road scores 8–9/10; calls for normal operations, just routine morning spot checks for isolated slick spots.\n- News Intel (20% weight): Finds no weather alerts, no closure chatter, no neighboring district closures, and NWS messaging focused on warming and melting, not storms.\n\nAll four domains independently point to the same conclusion: routine winter day with normal school operations. There are no meaningful conflicts between expert analyses.\n\n2) DISAGREEMENTS OR AMBIGUITIES\n- The only slight tension is the Safety Analyst’s label of “moderate” ice formation risk vs. the Meteorologist’s and Historian’s strong emphasis on dry conditions and lack of precip. But the safety narrative itself clarifies this as mostly a theoretical, localized black-ice concern on bridges/overpasses at around 30°F, not a widespread hazard.\n- No disagreements on key closure drivers: everyone agrees there is no accumulating snow, no freezing rain, no advisory-level wind or visibility issues, and no systemic travel disruption.\n\n3) PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New snowfall: 0\" forecast before, during, or after the school commute. That means there is effectively no plowing window to calculate—roads are expected to remain dry to just damp.\n- Any residual snow/ice from earlier events is actually expected to slowly melt or soften due to the modest warm-up and lack of new precip.\n- From a timing perspective, crews have the entire night and early morning (00:00–07:40) with no new accumulation, so they can focus on routine checks rather than active plowing or salting operations.\n\n4) ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Meteorology: 6 hours near/just below freezing with high humidity but explicitly notes no signal for freezing drizzle, glaze, or mixed precip.\n- Safety: Flags a moderate *localized* risk for black ice on elevated and shaded spots; still assigns high scores to roads and minimal commute impact.\n- History: Similar past setups (dry, near-freezing, breezy) have not led to closure and are described as routine; no pattern of systemic ice-driven shutdowns from this kind of forecast.\n- Net: There may be isolated slick patches, but no indication of broad, dangerous icing that would justify a district-wide closure in Michigan, where such conditions are common and well-managed.\n\n5) NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Neighboring districts checked (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) show NO planned or announced closures or delays for Dec. 17.\n- Kent ISD shows no coordinated weather closure messaging.\n- Local and regional TV/online news show no closure chatter, no storm headlines centered on Kent County, and highlight a warming trend instead.\n- Social media sentiment: “no_buzz” about closures or bad roads.\n- According to the decision rules, the absence of neighboring closures and the community signaling that this is a non-event both support staying at the low end of probability.\n\n6) THRESHOLDS VS. CURRENT EVENT\nMichigan closure thresholds supplied:\n- <4\" snow → 5–15% normally. We have 0\" → baseline should be at or near 0%, even *below* that typical range.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard conditions, no heavy lake-effect bands, no extreme cold (wind chills are only in the 20s°F, far from the -15°F type cold-closure triggers).\n- With 0\" new snow, dry conditions, and no alerts, this sits *below* the usual lowest tier for considering closure.\n\n7) WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS\nUsing the specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly supports 0% closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Slight caution for localized ice but explicitly endorses normal operations; contributes a very small upward nudge, but still essentially near 0% closure risk.\n- History (20%): Historical snow day rate ~0% for this pattern; supports a near-zero probability.\n- News Intel (20%): No closures, no chatter, no alerts, plus warming trend messaging; reinforces the near-zero estimate.\n\nIf each expert’s implied closure probability is approximated:\n- Meteorologist: ~0–1%\n- Safety: ~2–3% (to account for rare, worst-case localized ice surprises)\n- Historian: ~0–1%\n- News Intel: ~0–2%\nA weighted average lands around 1–2%. Given the Michigan thresholds and the total lack of active hazards, rounding to 1% is appropriate and keeps us decisive for Brier score performance without pretending absolute certainty.\n\n8) WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey failure modes that could raise closure odds after this forecast:\n- An unforecast overnight freezing-drizzle event or light freezing rain that causes widespread black ice on all roads by early morning.\n- A last-minute lake-effect band unexpectedly setting up directly over Rockford/Kent County with several inches of quick, poorly timed snow before the AM commute.\n- A non-weather issue (major power outage, water/main failure, building mechanical problem) coincidentally forcing closure despite benign weather.\nNone of these have current support in the meteorological data, historical patterns, safety assessment, or news/community signals.\n\nGiven the strong multi-expert consensus, high data consistency, and Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter conditions, the best calibrated prediction is a 1% chance of a weather-related snow day for Rockford on Wednesday, 2025-12-17. Normal school operations are overwhelmingly likely.",
