Temperatures stay well below freezing all day (high ~14°F, low near -1°F), so any light freezing rain overnight/early morning can freeze on contact and persist through the morning commute. Winds are moderate (max ~14 mph), so blowing/drifting is not the main issue. The biggest red flags are the freezing rain signal around the pre-dawn hours and the potential for freezing fog late (near-zero visibility in spots), both of which can make untreated roads, bridges, and parking lots slick. In Michigan, light snow alone wouldn’t close schools, but a glaze of ice plus poor visibility can—overall this looks like a 'delay/closure possible due to ice' setup rather than a classic snow day."

Snow amount is essentially nil, wind is modest (max ~14 mph), and wind chills look mostly above the common -15°F closure trigger. The main decision-maker is pre-dawn light freezing rain (noted around midnight, 3 AM, 5–6 AM) combined with very cold surfaces—this can produce a thin glaze and black ice on untreated roads. If icing is observed on bridges/secondary roads at daybreak, a 1–2 hour delay is historically the more common response; a full snow day typically requires more widespread or heavier icing, or concurrent whiteout lake-effect bands during the morning commute, neither of which is strongly indicated in the provided Wednesday forecast."

Your WeatherAPI forecast has temps roughly 0–14°F with the coldest wind chills/feels-like around -11.5°F overnight/early morning and around -7°F near the 8–9 AM school-commute window. Cross-checking web sources: Weather.com’s accessible hourly snippet shows a milder 'Feels Like' near +1°F around mid-morning (but the snippet is not clearly tied to 2026-01-28 and appears inconsistent with the broader arctic pattern). Weather Underground shows current conditions and nearby station data but the forecast-feels-like for 1/28 is not accessible in the snippet (JS-limited). Weather.gov point forecast snippet retrieved is clearly stale (shows a 'Last update' from Dec 1) and is not usable for verifying 2026-01-28 wind chill. A regional forecast article mentions wind chills near -11°F Wednesday, which is directionally consistent with the WeatherAPI magnitude (cold but not -20°F). Net: nothing verified below -20°F for Wed 1/28, but there is a >10°F feels-like discrepancy between the WeatherAPI morning wind chill and what Weather.com snippet shows, so confidence is only moderate/weak. Snow amounts on the target day look minimal; the bigger operational risk from your API is light freezing rain/ice rather than heavy snow.",

    "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts agree this is NOT a snowfall/plowing event; it’s an ice/black-ice morning with some visibility risk. Also agree wind chills are not extreme enough (no ≤ -20°F trigger). Most see DELAY as the modal outcome.\n2) Disagreement: Severity/coverage of icing and visibility. Safety frames ‘high’ morning risk; meteorology/history emphasize very small QPF and short window, making full closure less likely. Web verification flags the ‘0 mi visibility’ as uncorroborated for the commute window.\n3) Plow/treatment timing math: There’s essentially nothing to plow Wed AM; it’s treatment timing. Updated safety + infrastructure: trunklines/arterials likely improved by ~6:00–6:30, but county/local streets may remain inconsistent through ~7:30 and improve more meaningfully ~8:30–10:00. That timing aligns with a delay being effective.\n4) Ice: Yes—this is the primary driver. Even tiny freezing drizzle at 5–6 AM on very cold pavement can create a thin glaze, especially on bridges, hills, shaded secondary roads.\n5) Neighboring districts: Confirmed strong signal—Forest Hills shows a ‘One Hour Delay’ for Wed 1/28. That pushes toward delay rather than full closure; no confirmed multi-district closure cascade for Wed.\n6) Power: Power Grid Analyst verified extremely low systemwide outages (~2 customers affected) and only moderate localized risk. No outage-based override.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier found no ≤ -20°F in any accessible source; WeatherAPI also stays far above that. Cold contributes to persistence of ice, but not a standalone closure trigger.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) freezing rain is heavier/more continuous than forecast and produces widespread glazing on neighborhood roads before 6:30, (b) dense freezing fog/visibility near-zero persists into 6–8 AM (not supported by cross-check), (c) an unexpected multi-district closure cascade occurs overnight, or (d) localized power outages hit key school buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive):\n- Meteorology (25%): thin freezing rain risk but tiny QPF → leans away from full closure.\n- Safety (25%): bus-window black ice risk 5–8 AM → pulls probability upward.\n- History (15%): thin glaze usually produces delays more than closures → moderates.\n- News Intel (15%): neighboring Forest Hills delay (not closure) + no Rockford Wed post → moderates down.\n- Infrastructure (10%): local streets lag until ~8:30+ → supports delay, modest closure risk.\n- Power (5%): no outage signal → no upward adjustment.\n- Web verifier (5%): no ≤ -20°F; questions 0-mi visibility during commute → moderates.\n\nFinal call: A full closure is plausible but not the most likely outcome; the most likely operational response is a delay. Therefore, I set a 38% probability of a full snow day (closure) for Rockford on Wed 1/28, with moderate confidence due to uncertainty in actual icing coverage on secondary roads during 5–7 AM.",

But the precip totals are very small (0.01\" liquid for the day), winds are modest, and there’s no strong signal of a prolonged heavy icing episode or daytime deterioration—so a **full closure is possible but not the most common outcome**.

This looks like none of those in a classic sense: snow accumulation is essentially zero, winds are modest, and wind chills are cold but not typically ‘shutdown’ cold. However, the *combination* of residual slick roads from Tuesday’s lake-effect/blowing snow impacts plus a pre-dawn freezing rain/drizzle signal is exactly the kind of “thin glaze on top of existing winter grime/packed snow” that sometimes flips districts into either a 1–2 hour delay or (less often) a full closure if early observations show widespread glaze on secondary roads/bridges. Balancing those, I stay in the moderate range and slightly above a ‘typical cold day’ baseline, but below a majority likelihood because the modeled precip totals are tiny and the hazard window is short."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/operations standpoint, this looks like a classic “black-ice morning” setup rather than a plowable snow day. The forecast liquid amount is small, but at single-digit temps, a small amount of freezing drizzle/rain can create a thin, widespread glaze—especially on bridges, shaded roads, and untreated neighborhood bus routes—and it won’t melt during the morning because temps stay well below freezing all day. That said, West Michigan districts often manage light icing with aggressive salting and/or a delay, so a *full* closure is not the most likely outcome. Balancing those, I’m lowering my Round-1 safety leaning (70%) and landing at 45% for a full snow day (closure), with a higher implied probability for a delay than for closure."

However, from a news/institutional-signals perspective, I can’t justify going as high as a majority likelihood without (a) an active Wed-morning advisory/warning, (b) a visible multi-district closings cascade, or (c) verified power/road-emergency messaging. Net: I see a meaningful chance of a closure, but I still think the modal outcome is a **delay** rather than a full snow day."
