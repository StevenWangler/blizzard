      "Ice watch: because temps stay well below freezing all day (low ~21°F, high ~27°F) any residual moisture from prior days, treated slush melt, or overnight condensation can freeze—especially on bridges/overpasses, shaded stretches, and along river/low-lying areas.",
      "Primary roads (US-131 / M-44 corridors and other main arterials) should be in very good shape by the 6:30–8:00 AM bus window given no new snow and typical overnight salting; expect mostly dry to winter-wet pavement.",
      "Secondary and rural/residential roads should also be generally passable, but expect patchy packed-snow/ice remnants in neighborhood corners, cul-de-sacs, and on less-traveled gravel roads—these create the main bus-route variability.",
      "Wind: NNW 10–17 mph with gusts near ~20 mph can cause minor drifting ONLY if there is loose snow available; with no new snow forecast, drifting/whiteouts are unlikely. Wind does increase wind-chill exposure at bus stops.",
      "Wind chill: feels-like/windchill around ~9–12°F during the morning commute is cold but NOT in the automatic-closure range for Michigan. Expect higher absenteeism/late buses possible, but not a strong closure driver.",
      "Parking lots/sidewalks: risk is localized glaze/compacted spots (drop-off loops, bus loops, stairways, and crosswalk ramps). This is more a slip/fall mitigation issue than a transportation shutdown issue.",
      "Operational guidance: have transportation supervisors spot-check known trouble bridges and hilly neighborhood segments around 5:30–6:00 AM; if they find widespread glare ice (unlikely from this forecast alone), consider targeted route adjustments rather than district-wide closure.",
      "Mitigations: remind families to allow extra following distance; buses should run slightly reduced speeds on neighborhood streets; schools should salt entrances, ADA ramps, and student walkways before first arrival.",
      "Snow-day probability calibration (Michigan): With this forecast alone, closure is unlikely. Think ~5–15% snow-day probability (mostly dependent on unseen antecedent conditions—i.e., whether Sunday night leaves wet pavement that refreezes or leftover ice from earlier freezing rain)."
