      "Walking students & stops: Wind chills around **6–10°F** during the core bus pickup window (about 6–8 AM) increase discomfort but are **not** in the automatic extreme-cold closure range. Prioritize mitigations for exposed stops (extra layers, minimize wait times) rather than closure.",
      "Parking lots/drop-off: Expect compacted snow/ice patches to persist because highs only ~27°F. Ensure lots, sidewalks, steps, and parent loop get salt/sand early Monday morning; these surfaces are often worse than the main roads.",

In West Michigan/Michigan generally, with **no new precip** and routine maintenance, this usually stays open—**maybe a small delay risk** if widespread black ice is reported early."

News intel found no Rockford or nearby district closure announcements and no domino-effect cascade. Power-grid data could not be live-verified (interactive maps), but there is no weather pattern Monday (no ice, no high wind) that typically generates new widespread outages; outage-driven closure risk remains low unless there are ongoing pockets from the weekend. Web verification does not show any ≤-20°F wind chill trigger, and the Weather.com data appeared stale/misaligned; importantly, neither web nor API indicates extreme-cold thresholds.

The only plausible pathway to a snow day is not Monday’s weather, but a carryover hazard (widespread black ice) from Sun 2026-02-22’s light wintry mix/freezing rain, plus strong overnight refreeze. Given the forecast shows zero precip Monday and only moderate wind, I place full-closure odds in the low single digits but non-zero, landing at **5%** to reflect the refreeze wildcard (with a higher delay probability than closure).",

Historically, those are overwhelmingly *in-session* days for snow-hardened districts like Rockford unless there is a *leftover hazard* from the prior 12–24 hours.",

              "**Temperature/wind not at closure thresholds:** Morning temps ~20–21°F with wind chills ~6–8°F are uncomfortable but not historically associated with closures in this region. Winds/gusts (~15–17 mph, gusts ~20 mph) are below typical “blowing snow shutdown” territory, especially with no new snow forecast.",
              "**Main historical ‘gotcha’: refreeze/black ice from prior wintry mix (Sun 2026-02-22):** The broader forecast package indicates light snow/freezing rain potential on Sat/Sun. With Monday staying below freezing all day, any residual moisture could refreeze and linger into the Monday AM bus window. Historically this elevates *delay* risk more than full closure, unless icing is widespread on bus-route backroads.",
              "**Operational history/infrastructure:** Rockford’s proximity to Grand Rapids and typical treatment capacity (paved road density, salting) reduces closure likelihood in marginal events; closures more often correlate with active heavy snow, widespread glaze ice, or exceptional windchill—none are clearly present on Monday itself."

Because temperatures remain subfreezing, untreated moisture can hard-freeze overnight and linger into the 6–9 AM window. In a snow-hardened area like Rockford/Kent County, that typically prompts targeted salting and cautious driving rather than district-wide closure—unless Sunday’s icing is more extensive than implied or crews can’t treat in time.

The only plausible closure pathway is residual slickness (black ice) from Sat–Sun light freezing rain/snow that refreezes overnight into Monday. That risk exists but, meteorologically, is usually patchy/local and more likely to cause a delay than a district-wide closure. I therefore set a low closure probability at 4% (with a higher separate delay probability, if we were scoring that, roughly ~10–15%)."

The only plausible pathway to a snow day is not Monday’s weather, but a carryover hazard (widespread black ice) from Sun 2026-02-22’s light wintry mix/freezing rain, plus strong overnight refreeze. Given the forecast shows zero precip Monday and only moderate wind, I place full-closure odds in the low single digits but non-zero, landing at **5%** to reflect the refreeze wildcard (with a higher delay probability than closure)."

That strongly argues against a snow day. The only meaningful closure pathway is **widespread refreeze/black ice** from the Sat–Sun wintry mix (notably the freezing-rain signals in the prior-day forecast). Because temperatures remain subfreezing, untreated moisture can hard-freeze overnight and linger into the 6–9 AM window. In a snow-hardened area like Rockford/Kent County, that typically prompts targeted salting and cautious driving rather than district-wide closure—unless Sunday’s icing is more extensive than implied or crews can’t treat in time. Net: low chance of full closure, slightly higher chance of a delay (not asked for here)."

The only headline-style regional indicator (light snow possible in parts of West/Central Lower Michigan into Monday) doesn’t match the specific Rockford-day forecast details (no precip Monday) strongly enough to push toward a snow day call. I’m leaving a small non-zero probability to account for overnight refreeze/black ice reports or an unexpected narrow snow band that triggers an early-morning decision."
