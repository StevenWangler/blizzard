    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Friday 2026-01-02, conditions look like a straightforward cold, partly cloudy winter day with no active precipitation. Temperatures stay in the 21–29°F range all day, remaining solidly below freezing but without any warm-nose or marginal layers that would support freezing rain; it is simply dry and cold. All hourly data for the overnight period leading into the school morning (00:00–09:00) show 0.00\" precip, 0 snow, and no rain or drizzle flags, so no new accumulation or icing is expected after the advisory ends Thursday morning. Winds from the W–WNW are modest (generally 7–11 mph with gusts under 15 mph), enough to drive wind chills into the low to mid teens for morning arrival but not nearly strong enough for blowing/drifting problems given the very light existing snow cover. Visibility runs 3–6 miles overnight under overcast/partly cloudy skies and improves with daylight; there is no indication of fog, heavy snow, or mixed precip to reduce visibility. The prior Winter Weather Advisory for light snow/freezing rain is confined to late Wednesday night into early Thursday (expiring 07:00 EST on 2026-01-01) and does not overlap the target school day. In a Michigan context—where districts routinely operate with several inches of fresh snow—these dry, cold, light-wind, good-visibility conditions are well within normal operating range. Road crews will have had more than 24 hours after the advisory to treat any slick spots. Overall, the meteorological risk for a snow/ice closure or delay on Friday 2026-01-02 is very low; schools are overwhelmingly likely to be open on time."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, Friday, 2026-01-02 in Rockford, Michigan features dry weather (0\" new snow, 0% hourly snow chance), partly cloudy skies, and seasonable cold with morning temperatures in the low 20s°F and wind chills near 10°F–15°F above zero, warming to upper 20s°F by afternoon. Winds remain under about 15 mph with no blowing snow issues. The preceding Winter Weather Advisory ends early on January 1 with only up to one inch of additional accumulation and a full calendar day for cleanup before the target school day. In West Michigan, including Rockford, snow days are usually reserved for heavier snowfall events (~8–10\"+ with poor timing), significant ice storms, or dangerous wind chills below about -15°F. None of those triggers appear in this setup. Historically, days matching this pattern—cold, dry, and post-advisory with minimal residual impacts—almost always proceed with school as normal, aside from localized slippery spots. Overall confidence is high that January 2, 2026 presents a very low historical likelihood of a district-wide snow day closure for Rockford Public Schools."

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n\n(1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Dry, cold, typical winter day on Fri Jan 2, 2026. No overnight or morning snow, 0\" accumulation, light winds, good visibility. Prior advisory ends Thu morning and does NOT affect Friday.\n- Historian: Days like this (cold, dry, post-light-advisory, no new precip) almost never produce snow days in West Michigan; historical closure rates ~1–3%.\n- Safety analyst: Roads and walking conditions are good (scores 7–9/10). Only localized black ice possible; recommends standard operations, no closure/delay.\n- News/community intel: No emergency weather messaging, no outage reports, no closure chatter. Conditions framed as routine lake-effect regime, not a major storm.\n\nCommon agreement: Weather and road conditions for Jan 2 are well within normal Michigan operating norms and do NOT justify a snow day on their own.\n\n(2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- The only apparent tension is between:\n  • Meteorology/historian/safety tools: Emphasize a DRY Friday with impacts already cleaned up.\n  • One external regional article mentioning lake-effect through Jan 1–2 with “a few inches possible.”\n- However, the provided meteorological dataset for Rockford specifically states 0\" snow and 0% precip on Jan 2 and high confidence in a dry, cold day. Safety scoring (8–9/10 roads) also implicitly supports the dry, low-impact scenario.\n- News intel confirms that for Rockford itself, there is no sign of a significant storm or disruption.\n\nConclusion: No meaningful operational conflict. Where there is slight external noise about lake-effect, the location-specific forecast, safety scores, and historical context all align on **low impact** for Rockford on Jan 2.\n\n(3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Prior Winter Weather Advisory (for light snow/freezing drizzle) ends: Thu Jan 1 at 07:00 EST.\n- Target school arrival (if there were school): Fri Jan 2 around 07:40 EST.\n- Time gap: ~24 hours + 40 minutes between advisory end and next morning arrival.\n- That is ample time for Kent County road crews to plow/salt and for residual moisture to be treated. With **no new snow** forecast overnight into Friday, plow timing is more than sufficient.\n\n(4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- No freezing rain/mixed precip flags for Thu night–Fri morning; column is cold and dry.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing, so **refreeze** is possible on untreated spots.\n- Safety analyst labels ice formation risk as “moderate” but still gives:\n  • Primary roads: 9/10\n  • Secondary roads: 8/10\n  • Parking lots: 8/10\n- Meteorologist emphasizes no active icing mechanism (no new drizzle or rain); risk is limited to typical Michigan black ice in a few shaded or low-volume areas.\n\nConclusion: There is **no active ice storm or freezing rain event**. Only localized, manageable refreeze risk – not the sort of ice that drives district-wide closures.\n\n(5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel:\n  • No evidence that Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or other Kent County neighbors have announced weather-related closures for Fri Jan 2.\n  • Many neighboring districts are also on winter break around this date.\n  • Kent ISD has no special weather messaging or emergency notices for Jan 2.\n- Under the competition rules, 3+ neighboring districts closing for weather would push the probability up 15–20%. That trigger is **not met**.\n\n(6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Upside risk (actual closure when predicted open):\n  • A last-minute, unforecasted lake-effect band sets up directly over Rockford overnight, dropping 4–8\" with poor timing into the morning commute.\n  • A localized ice event (e.g., surprise freezing drizzle) creates widespread glazing on rural bus routes before crews can respond.\n  • A non-weather factor (power outage, building issue) forces a closure that isn’t captured in the weather-based tools.\n  These all appear low-probability given: zero-snow forecast, no freezing rain signatures, no outage reports, and no significant NWS headlines overlapping Friday.\n\n- Downside risk (predicting high closure probability when no closure occurs):\n  • Overreacting to generalized regional articles about lake-effect while ignoring the precise Rockford forecast.\n  • Misinterpreting normal winter break closures as weather-driven “snow days.”\n  The tools and news intel explicitly clarify that Jan 2 is **scheduled break**, not a weather closure.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Indicates a dry, cold day: 0\" new snow, 0% precip, modest winds, decent visibility, advisory long expired.\n  • In a Michigan context, this is firmly “school as usual” weather.\n  • Drives the base probability very low (around 2–5%).\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Road scores: 8–9/10, walking 7/10, “minimal” morning and afternoon commute impacts.\n  • Recommends standard operations, no closure or delay.\n  • Supports staying at the **low end** of any snow-day probability band.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Historical closure rates for similar days: 1–3%.\n  • Seasonal adjustment is actually negative (conditions less hazardous than a typical active-snow pattern).\n  • Anchors the forecast solidly in the single-digit percent range.\n\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, “secret weapon”):\n  • Critical finding: Rockford Public Schools is **already closed for winter break through Jan 2**, with classes resuming Mon Jan 5.\n  • That means there is no operational “snow day” decision to make; weather is irrelevant to whether school runs on Jan 2.\n  • No neighboring weather-based closures, no snow-day chatter, no outage or emergency signals.\n  • This eliminates any need to bump the probability up for regional coordination; if anything, it reinforces that **any closure on that date is scheduled, not weather-driven**.\n\n3. APPLYING THE MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- Snow/ice criteria:\n  • Forecast snow: 0\" → below the <4\" category, so we start at or below the 5–15% band.\n  • No storm, no ice storm, no blizzard, no 8\"+ totals.\n  • Wind chills (around +10 to +15°F) are well above the -15°F to -20°F cold-closure thresholds.\n- Neighbor coordination:\n  • 0 neighboring districts with weather closures; many simply on winter break.\n  • No +15–20% adjustment.\n\nGiven all this, a pure **weather-based** snow-day probability for a normal school day would be about 2–4%, solidly at the bottom of the Michigan <4\" guideline range.\n\n4. FINAL DECISION AND BRIER-SCORE MINDSET\n- To compete effectively (Brier score), the aim is to be sharp and not inflate probabilities when the signal is overwhelmingly one-sided.\n- Here, all tools converge on: “This is standard cold, mostly dry winter weather with good roads by morning and no major operational hazard.”\n- News intel further reveals: there is **no school scheduled** on Jan 2 due to winter break.\n\nInterpreting “snow day probability” as: probability that Rockford Public Schools is closed **because of weather** on Jan 2, 2026, I assign:\n- **3% probability** of a weather-driven closure (very unlikely) and 97% that any non-school status is purely scheduled break, not a snow day.\n\nThis is decisive (nowhere near the 40–60% uncertainty band) and aligned with historical, meteorological, safety, and community evidence.\n",
