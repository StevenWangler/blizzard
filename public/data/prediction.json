    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Wednesday, 2025-12-24, this is a classic cold, gray, but quiet late-December day. Temperatures hover right around freezing (31–33°F) for essentially the entire 24-hour period with wind chills in the 20s, but there is no modeled precipitation at any hour: 0.00\" liquid, 0.0 cm snow, and 0% chance of snow or rain. Skies are overcast with periods of mist and freezing fog around the early-morning commute (roughly 5–8 AM), yet visibility is still forecast near 6+ miles, well above thresholds that typically concern schools. Winds stay light to moderate (generally 5–10 mph, gusts up to mid-teens) from the north to southeast, with no blowing/drifting snow risk because there is no new snow and no significant existing snowpack indicated. Roads may be damp and could develop isolated slick patches in low spots or on bridges due to subfreezing surface temps plus freezing fog, but with no accumulating snow or ice storm signal, plow operations are not stressed and travel impacts should be minor and localized by Michigan standards. Overall, the meteorological setup does not support a snow day: conditions are cold and somewhat frosty but stable, with no accumulating snow, no ice storm, no high winds, and no major visibility problems. From a Michigan school-operations perspective, the probability of weather-related closure or delay on Wednesday, 2025-12-24 due to these conditions alone is very low."

Michigan districts in this region typically need: (1) a substantial snow event (8–10+ inches with poor timing), (2) a true ice storm/freezing rain event causing widespread glazing, or (3) extreme cold with wind chill below roughly -15°F. None of those triggers are present here. While brief freezing fog could cause some isolated slick spots on untreated surfaces in the early morning, this is usually addressed by road crews and is not, by itself, a reason for system-wide closure in Kent County. Historically similar days—dry, cloudy, near-freezing, light wind, no measurable snow or ice—result in essentially 0% snow day incidence. Overall confidence is high that, based solely on weather, this would be a normal school day from a meteorological standpoint (not considering calendar/holiday scheduling)."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, cold, gray day; 0% snow, 0.00\" liquid, no ice storm, no strong winds, visibility ~6+ miles. Explicitly: \"does not support a snow day\" and probability of weather-related closure is very low.\n- Historian: Multiple past patterns with nearly identical conditions have 0% historical snow day rate. West Michigan closures this time of year come from 8–10\"+ snow, true ice storms, or extreme cold (wind chill below ~-15°F). None apply.\n- Safety analyst: Primary/secondary roads 8–9/10, parking lots 8/10, driving conditions 8/10, visibility good. Main hazard: moderate risk of patchy black ice from freezing fog 4–9 AM. Concludes: no snow day warranted; maybe just a cautionary communication.\n- News intel: Rockford and neighboring districts are already on Winter Break (Dec 22–Jan 4); Dec 24 is not a class day. No local buzz or special advisories about severe weather in Kent County for that date.\nAll four agree there is no weather-driven reason to cancel a school day, and that there is effectively no school day to cancel.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\n- There are no substantive conflicts. The only potential tension is that the safety analyst flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk, while the meteorologist/historian frame it as a minor, routine hazard. This is more about wording than substance: all still say conditions are manageable and not closure-worthy.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Forecast precip: none. Plows are not needed beyond standard operations. \n- Because there is no accumulating snow and only patchy freezing fog, there is no \"hours from snow end to 7:40 AM\" window to compute. Instead, road crews focus on salting known slick spots before the early-morning window (before ~6 AM). Safety guidance explicitly expects normal bus operation with pretreatment.\n\n4. ICE CONSIDERATIONS\n- Air temps: ~30–32°F from 4–9 AM with high humidity and freezing fog/mist.\n- Risk: thin, patchy black ice on untreated surfaces, shaded secondary roads, bridges, and sidewalks/steps.\n- Scope: localized, not a glaze/ice-storm scenario. No freezing rain, no widespread power issues, and visibility remains around 6 miles.\nIn Michigan, this level of risk is routinely managed via salting and caution, not via full-district closure, particularly with no bus-visibility or citywide access problems.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and other Kent ISD districts are also on winter break, with Dec 24 inside the break.\n- There is no \"domino\" of weather-related closures; the shared reason for being closed is the holiday calendar, not weather.\n- Under the provided rules, the +15–20% adjustment for neighboring weather-based closures does not apply because their status is scheduled break, not reactive closure.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\n- A surprise, significant freezing rain event overnight, producing widespread ice/glaze far beyond patchy slick spots.\n- An unforecast snow burst or lake-effect band dropping several inches right over the district at bad timing.\n- A last-minute change in district policy treating even minor patchy ice as closure-worthy (historically very unlikely here).\nGiven the explicit 0% precip signal in the meteorological analysis and the lack of any alerts or buzz in news intel, the chance of such a swing is extremely small.\n\n7. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (as instructed)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Points to essentially 0% closure probability based solely on weather. I translate this to ~1–2% to allow for model/forecast error.\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as good overall, with manageable early-morning slickness. Implied closure probability ~2–3%. Weighted contribution keeps the combined estimate very low but not literally zero.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show 0% closure in comparable setups. This strongly anchors the forecast near zero.\n- News Intelligence (20%): Secret weapon here: confirms there is no school in session due to Winter Break and no active closure chatter. This drives the *operational* snow-day probability effectively to 0%, since there is nothing to cancel.\n\nCombining these, and acknowledging tiny but nonzero uncertainty in meteorology/safety while the calendar reality drives operational risk to almost strictly zero, I set the final snow-day probability at 1%. This is low enough to reflect near-certainty of \"no snow day\" while not claiming literal impossibility, which protects Brier score calibration.\n\nBecause all experts are aligned and there is no meaningful conflict, and because the district is already closed for winter break, confidence in this assessment is very high.",
