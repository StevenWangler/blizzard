    "overall_conditions_summary": "For the day and night leading into Monday, December 29, 2025 in Rockford, MI, the forecast is marginally cold but largely above or right at freezing with no accumulating snow signal. From late Sunday night (12/28) through the pre‑dawn hours of Monday, temperatures hover around 30–32°F, then rise into the mid 30s on Sunday afternoon and even upper 30s Sunday evening. Precipitation on Sunday is very light and mainly in the form of drizzle or patchy rain, with total liquid around 0.02\" and zero modeled snowfall. Winds are modest (generally 5–13 mph with gusts under ~25 mph) so there’s some wind chill in the 20s early, but nothing extreme by Michigan standards. \n\nThe main travel concern in this forecast period is dense fog and low visibility (down to 0–1 mile at times Sunday afternoon and again Sunday evening), not snow or ice. With pavement already treated and daytime highs mid 30s Sunday, any residual icing from the earlier Friday (12/26) advisory should be largely resolved well before the Monday 12/29 school commute. No overnight accumulating snow, no freezing rain signal Sunday night, and temperatures near/above freezing by early morning all strongly favor normal school operations in a snow‑experienced district like Rockford. \n\nBottom line for Monday 12/29: very low likelihood of a snow day. Roads may be damp and there could be leftover patches of slickness in spots if fog deposits on colder surfaces, but there is no indication of the 4–6\"+ snowfall, significant ice, or ongoing winter storm that would typically trigger closures in West Michigan."

The more serious hazard, freezing rain and ice under a Winter Weather Advisory, is confined to Friday 12/26 and not projected to persist into Monday. By late Sunday night, roads are likely just wet with scattered slick patches at worst, and there is no signal of 8–10+ inches of snow, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold near the Monday 12/29 morning commute. Historically, Rockford/Kent County schools almost never close under a setup of fog, light rain/mist, and near‑freezing temperatures without substantial new snow or ongoing icing. Overall, the historical analogs suggest a very low probability (on the order of a few percent or less) of a snow day for Monday 2025‑12‑29, and the forecast details reinforce that expectation. Confidence in a ‘school likely in session’ outcome is high, assuming no unforeseen, stronger storm develops that is not reflected in this forecast snapshot."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- Meteorology: No accumulating snow, no winter headlines aimed at Sunday night/Monday, temps around 30–33°F and slowly rising, light drizzle/fog the main issue. Concludes very low likelihood of a snow day.\n- History: Similar patterns (near-freezing, fog/drizzle, zero snow) produce snow days only ~2–5% of the time in Rockford. District typically closes only for 8–10\"+ snow, persistent ice into commute, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold. Assesses very low probability of closure for this setup.\n- Safety: Road risk low; primary roads 9/10, secondary and lots 8/10, driving conditions 8/10. Morning commute impact minimal, no plow-capacity issues, only scattered slick spots possible.\n- News/Intelligence: Rockford is on Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 2; there is no school day to cancel on Dec 29. No neighboring-district weather closures or buzz for that date.\nAll four agree there is no credible basis for a weather-driven closure of a school day on Monday, Dec 29—and the news intel further clarifies that school is not scheduled at all.\n\n2. Conflicts:\nThere are no material conflicts.\n- Meteorology mentions only a past advisory on Fri 12/26; it explicitly ends the same day and does not extend into Monday.\n- History and safety both support a low-risk Monday given above-freezing temps and no snow.\n- News intel’s note about a \"chance of further wintry weather Sunday–Monday\" is consistent with the very light, mostly-rain/fog signal in the meteorological dataset and does not contradict it.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Ice advisory: Friday 12/26, roughly 05:00–16:00.\n- After that, temperatures rise and remain near or above freezing, with light precip and fog through the weekend.\n- By Sunday 12/28 and into the pre-dawn of Monday 12/29, modeled snowfall is 0\" and roads are expected to be wet, not snow-covered.\n- For a typical 7:40 AM Monday start, there are well over 24–36 hours between the end of any meaningful icing and the Monday commute, giving crews ample time to treat/clear surfaces.\n- No overnight snow means no last-minute plow surge needed.\nResult: Plow timing is more than sufficient; it does not support a closure.\n\n4. Ice considerations:\n- Significant ice is limited to Friday under a Winter Weather Advisory, not Sunday night/Monday. That event is transient and ends the same day per NWS.\n- Some residual patchy slick spots can linger on untreated surfaces, especially with fog and near-freezing temps, but air temps rising into the mid 30s and light rain/drizzle help melt and dilute surface ice.\n- There is no signal of a new freezing-rain event on Sunday night into Monday in the provided dataset.\nThus, there is not the kind of widespread, ongoing ice on Monday morning that historically forces Rockford closures.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intel explicitly notes that nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) have no separate weather closures for Monday, Dec 29, because they are also on winter break or not in regular session.\n- No regional \"domino effect\" of closures is in play, and thus there is no +15–20% upward adjustment from neighboring-district decisions.\n\n6. What would make this wrong?\n- An unmodeled, stronger storm system developing late Sunday that produces unexpected heavy snow (6–8\"+), significant new ice, or blizzard-like visibility issues aimed squarely at Monday morning.\n- A misinterpretation of the school calendar (e.g., if the district actually had classes on Dec 29 despite multiple official posts to the contrary). Given two independent district sources confirming break through Jan 2, this risk is extremely low.\n- A significant, long-duration power-outage or tree-damage event persisting from the Friday ice into Monday, which current intel does not show (no major outage reports in Rockford).\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (as directed)\n- Meteorology (35%): Very clear: no snow, marginal temps, modest winds, fog main concern, advisory confined to Friday. On its own this supports roughly a 3–5% snow-day probability.\n- Safety (25%): Road and travel risk low; commute impact minimal; Michigan’s winter operations easily handle this. This nudges the probability slightly lower than raw meteorology might suggest, toward ~2–3%.\n- History (20%): Analog days under similar patterns show 2–5% closure rates, aligning strongly with the other two and reinforcing a low value.\n- News Intelligence (20% – secret weapon): Confirms school is not even in session on Dec 29 and that no neighbors are closing for weather. In a world where classes existed that day, lack of chatter would keep us at the low end of probabilities; in reality, it effectively turns any \"snow day\" question into moot. From a probabilistic scoring standpoint, the chance of a weather-based snow day call on a non-school day rounds essentially to 0–2%.\n\nFINAL PROBABILITY CHOICE\n- Base from meteorology/history/safety: ~3–4% chance of conditions severe enough that Rockford might close if it were a normal school day.\n- News intel adjustment: Since the calendar shows no school on Dec 29, the effective probability of an actual weather-driven snow day decision is essentially zero. To reflect that while acknowledging a tiny tail risk of either (a) a stronger-than-expected storm or (b) a calendar error, I set the final probability at 2%.\n- This keeps us out of the discouraged 40–60% band and matches the strong consensus and high confidence level.\n\nTherefore: For Monday, December 29, 2025 in Rockford, MI, the probability of a *weather-caused* snow day is effectively near zero, and there is in any case no scheduled school to cancel. Normal operations (for those not on break) should proceed with standard winter precautions.",
