No accumulating snow is indicated, and the day is largely dry/overcast. The only meaningful flag is patchy morning mist/low visibility (around 1 mile at times near 8–9 AM) plus a very late-evening (around 11 PM) signal for light freezing rain/trace precip—too late to affect Thursday morning travel, but potentially relevant for Friday if it expands earlier overnight. Given Michigan plow capacity and the lack of morning snow/ice, snow-day probability for Thursday is low (~5–10%), with the main risk being localized slick spots on untreated surfaces if any trace freezing drizzle occurs earlier than forecast."

My calibrated estimate for a full-day closure for Rockford on Thu is **~6%** (delay risk maybe a bit higher, roughly **10–15%**, if visibility is truly poor on rural routes at 6:30–8:00 AM). The main wildcard is whether the freezing-drizzle/freezing-rain signal shifts earlier into the pre-dawn commute; if it does (even a light glaze), closure odds would jump sharply."

      "**Road condition expectation (Michigan-calibrated):** With no meaningful new snowfall and plenty of overnight maintenance capacity, **MDOT/county routes should be in good winter-drivable shape by 7 AM**. Secondary/residential roads may have isolated slick patches where mist deposits moisture and then freezes.",
      "**Late-evening icing signal:** the forecast shows **light freezing rain around 11 PM Thu** (very light QPF). This is *after* school hours, so it’s not a Thu snow-day driver—but it’s a **heads-up for Thu night / Fri AM** planning if it expands earlier than forecast.",

In most states the fog+ice combo might push closures; **in Michigan this more commonly stays an “open, but cautious” day** unless real freezing drizzle develops during the commute.",

That is rarely a full-closure setup in West Michigan.\n\nThe meaningful watch-outs are (a) mist/low stratus reducing visibility (notably around 8–9 AM) and (b) black-ice potential from refreeze/condensation given high humidity and subfreezing temps. Those hazards more commonly produce caution messaging or an occasional delay than a district-wide closure.\n\nI’m holding snow-day probability at **8%** (with a higher “delay” probability than “closure”), because the forecast lacks the two biggest closure drivers: significant snow/ice *during* the morning commute and/or high winds causing drifting."

The WeatherAPI forecast for Thu 2026-02-05 shows **0 cm snow**, very light winds (max ~12 mph), and only a misty/low-vis window near the commute. That aligns with a low closure base rate (roughly mid–single digits). I’m slightly above my baseline (~6%) because (1) the fog/mist could be locally worse on rural bus routes and (2) cold temps make any leftover moisture a black-ice risk on bridges/side roads, which sometimes tips marginal decisions. Net: low chance of a *full* snow day, modest chance of a delay."

The only meaningful school-transport risk in the provided *target-day* forecast is reduced visibility during the morning drive window plus isolated refreeze/black-ice potential. Those hazards more commonly produce delays or extra caution messaging than full closures in Michigan.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable going as low as the 5–10% range without caveats because the data includes (1) very high humidity and multiple mist hours near bus time, and (2) conflicting third-party ‘feels like’/wind-chill claims in the web verifier. I do *not* accept the verifier’s “automatic 90–95%” rule as valid without fresh, time-aligned confirmation; its cited pages are stale and internally inconsistent. Still, the existence of that discrepancy suggests a non-trivial chance the real early-morning cold/visibility/icing profile is worse than the WeatherAPI snapshot.\n\nNet: I put full-day closure at ~12% (higher than the met/history estimates) mainly to reflect the downside risk that fog + spot ice becomes widespread enough on rural bus routes to prompt a delay/closure call, even with minimal precip."

I keep probability non-zero because (a) districts can close on localized ice/fog if rural bus routes are impacted at daybreak, and (b) there is conflicting third-party “feels like” info in the verifier summary that, if true and current, could elevate risk—though it appears stale/inconsistent and not corroborated by local closures reporting."
