    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford on Tuesday 2025-12-02, snow and travel impacts are front‑loaded into the overnight hours. From midnight through about 4 AM, moderate snow persists with ~1.3–1.5\" of additional accumulation, temps in the mid‑20s F, wind chills in the upper teens, and visibility occasionally down to ~1 mile. Snow intensity then quickly diminishes around 4–5 AM, transitioning to mist with no further accumulating precip through the morning commute. Roads for the early bus window will be snow‑covered and slick from 3–7\" total storm accumulation (most of that falling Monday afternoon/evening), but winds are light and temps remain below freezing, so no refreeze-on-wet-pavement/ice storm scenario—this is a cold, fairly manageable snow event by West Michigan standards.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance and the fact that accumulating snow is tapering off by ~4 AM with only light mist and temps near 26–28°F during the actual school commute, plows will have several hours to clear primary routes. Localized difficult spots are possible, especially on rural/secondary roads and where the heavier lake-effect band grazes the area, but this pattern favors delays over closures. Overall: moderate winter travel impacts, but odds of a full snow day strictly for Tuesday 12/02 in Rockford are on the lower side; a 1–2 hour delay is more plausible than widespread cancellation, barring a last‑minute shift in heavier lake-effect bands into Kent County during the pre‑dawn window."

After ~4–5 AM on Tuesday, the forecast trends toward mist and cloudy skies with no new accumulation, temps in the mid‑20s°F, light winds, and improving visibility.\n- Forecast winds (generally <15 mph, gusts under ~20 mph) are well below blizzard criteria, and wind chills in the teens are nowhere near the extreme‑cold thresholds that typically trigger Michigan closures.\n- By the core bus/commute window (6–8 AM Tuesday), conditions are cold, damp, and possibly foggy/misty with slick spots from prior snow, but not an active heavy‑snow situation.\nHistorically for Rockford and similar West Michigan inland districts, this pattern corresponds to a relatively low closure rate: schools more often stay open with cautionary messaging and perhaps some delays or localized issues rather than full district‑wide cancellations. Given Michigan’s higher tolerance for snow, the advisory‑level totals, lack of extreme cold, and timing that allows night crews several hours for treatment before buses roll, the historical context suggests that while travel could be messy and slower than normal—especially on subdivision and rural roads—the probability of a full snow day solely from these conditions is modest rather than high."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist, historian, safety analyst, and news intel all align that:\n  • This is an advisory-level event for Rockford with roughly 3–5\" total snow by daybreak, not a major blizzard for Kent County.\n  • The heaviest snow and worst visibility are focused Monday evening through around 3–4 AM, with accumulating snow largely ending by ~4–5 AM.\n  • Temperatures stay below freezing (mid‑20s to upper 20s°F) but are not dangerously cold; no extreme wind chills or blizzard conditions.\n  • Main roads should be plowed and treated overnight, leaving primarily slick/packed snow on some secondary and rural routes at bus time.\n  • Travel impacts for the Tuesday morning commute are ‘moderate’ rather than severe, trending better by late morning.\n  • Historically, Rockford and similar West Michigan districts usually remain open for this kind of 3–5\" overnight event when the snow is tapering by bus time.\n  • As of Monday evening, there are no official closure/delay announcements locally, and no major road/emergency headlines.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There is no major conflict; differences are in phrasing rather than substance:\n  • Meteorologist: explicitly leans toward ‘delay more plausible than closure.’\n  • Safety analyst: sees conditions as ‘moderate’ risk and says full closure is less likely than normal start or a short delay.\n  • Historian: gives 15–25% historical closure rates for similar patterns.\n  • News intel: shows no closure signals yet and indicates normal operations are more likely than not, but still pending early-morning checks.\n- Overall, all point to LOW but non-zero closure odds; no expert suggests a high-likelihood snow day.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM):\n- Worst/peak conditions: ~18:00 Mon to ~05:00 Tue.\n- Meteorology and safety both indicate accumulating snow ends or becomes negligible by ~04:00–05:00.\n- First high-school buses/HS start around 7:30–7:45 AM; use 7:40 AM as reference.\n- That gives roughly 2.5–3.5 hours between tapering of accumulating snow (4–5 AM) and first bell, and even longer (3–4+ hours) before most K–5 runs.\n- In West Michigan/Kent County, with robust plow operations used to overnight events, that window is usually enough to get:\n  • Primary routes and bus corridors in decent shape (plowed/treated, maybe still partly snow-covered).\n  • Secondary/neighborhood roads partially cleared but passable at reduced speeds.\n- This timing strongly favors keeping school open or, at most, a short delay for trouble spots rather than a full district closure.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Precipitation type is all snow in the forecast; no mixed sleet/freezing rain is indicated.\n- Temps are cold but steady (mid‑20s F), meaning snow stays as snow, with compacted patches on roads and sidewalks.\n- Safety assessment lists ‘ice_formation_risk: moderate’—this reflects compacted snow and some icy patches on untreated surfaces and in parking lots, NOT a glaze ice storm.\n- Winds are light (around 5–9 mph) with limited drifting and no refreeze-on-wet-pavement scenario after a warmup.\n- Conclusion: standard packed-snow/spot-ice winter driving, not an ice-storm event that would push probabilities into the 60–80% closure range.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel:\n  • No closures or delays posted yet for Rockford or its typical peer districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) for Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, as of the evening check.\n  • These districts historically coordinate and are willing to close for serious weather, but there is no sign yet of a coordinated shutdown.\n  • No significant MDOT/Kent County alerts or event cancellations specifically for this morning.\n- According to the competition rules, ‘3+ neighboring districts closed -> +15–20% adjustment.’ Right now, we have zero confirmed neighboring closures, so no positive bump is applied.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- Main ways a 22% estimate could be too low:\n  • The heavier lake-effect band, currently aimed closer to Muskegon/Oceana, unexpectedly shifts inland and stalls directly over Kent/Rockford between ~2–6 AM, producing another 2–4\" right at commute time.\n  • Plow operations underperform due to staffing/mechanical issues, leading to very poor conditions on key bus routes at 5–6 AM.\n  • A late-developing freezing drizzle/fog icing issue appears near sunrise, creating more widespread ice than currently forecast.\n  • Superintendents, spooked by the nearby Winter Storm Warnings at the lakeshore, opt for a ‘safety-first’ closure even with marginal-but-manageable conditions.\n- Ways this estimate could be a bit high:\n  • Snow totals come in on the low side (closer to 2–3\"), with especially efficient nighttime plowing and good treatment; conditions by 6–8 AM exceed ‘moderate’ and feel routine.\n  • Community and district leadership lean toward maximizing in-person days, especially if they have already burned several snow days earlier in the season (not clearly the case here, but possible by winter).\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Indicates 3–7\" regionally, Rockford near the lower-middle part of that range, with the bulk of accumulation done before dawn.\n  • Clear statement: ‘odds of a full snow day… on the lower side; a 1–2 hour delay is more plausible.’\n  • This strongly supports a base closure probability around 20–25%.\n\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Road scores (out of 5) around 4–5 for primary/secondary/parking lots; this means slick but manageable with proper plowing and salting.\n  • Calls the risk ‘moderate’ and states ‘a full closure on Tuesday is less likely than either a normal start or, at most, a short delay.’\n  • From a safety standpoint, that suggests closure odds under 30% but not near zero.\n\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Historical snow-day rates for very similar patterns: 15%, 20%, and 25% (the latter with lower confidence).\n  • Given Michigan’s tolerance and Rockford’s inland position relative to the worst bands, a historical expectation clusters around 18–22%.\n\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon):\n  • Zero confirmed neighboring district closures; no district alerts; no notable local travel emergencies.\n  • Community sentiment is ‘uncertain’ rather than ‘we’re shutting down’ or ‘this is nothing’, but the absence of evening closure chatter plus advisory-not-warning status for Kent pushes against a high probability.\n  • According to the adjustment rules: with 0 neighboring closures and no strong closure expectation, there is NO +15–20% bump, and no +10–15% community bump.\n\nNUMERIC SYNTHESIS & BRIER STRATEGY\n- Base from historical analogs: ~18–22%.\n- Meteorology and safety both point to ‘low but non-zero’ closure, supporting around 20–25%.\n- News intel confirms no early closures in peers, so no upward adjustment.\n- There’s no strong expert conflict, so we don’t need to split the difference widely.\n- To be decisive and avoid the 40–60% ‘mushy middle,’ I set:\n  • Final snow day probability: 22%.\n- This sits comfortably within the Michigan guidance for <4\"–5\" advisory-level snow with decent timing (5–25% range) and matches the combined signal: a bit higher than the absolute-minimum 5–15% because of the active advisories and rural routes, but still clearly on the ‘schools likely open’ side.\n\nBottom line: All four expert domains point to a typical early-season West Michigan snow event where travel is slower and slick but manageable, plows have a decent window to work, and there is no ice storm or blizzard. Historically and operationally, that translates to Rockford being more likely to hold school (possibly with localized delays) than to call a full snow day.",
