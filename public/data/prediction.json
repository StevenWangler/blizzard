The main impact is dense fog/mist overnight into the early morning with visibility as low as ~1 mile around midnight–2 AM, improving to ~6 miles by the 3–9 AM school commute window. Temperatures are below freezing at bus time (mid-20s) with wind chills around 19°F—cold but nowhere near Michigan closure thresholds. Winds increase modestly (S–SSW 5–10 mph early, gusts ~12–16 mph) and are not sufficient for blowing/drifting. Net: roads should be largely fine aside from possible slick spots on untreated surfaces/bridges due to high humidity and subfreezing temps; the commute risk is mostly reduced visibility rather than snow load. Snow-day/closure probability: very low (~1–5%); at most a small chance of a 1–2 hour delay if fog locally thickens right at 6–8 AM, but the provided hourly vis suggests improvement by commute time."

      "Bus ops: run a 'scout loop' (or have lead drivers report) on known trouble spots by ~5:30–6:00 AM—bridges, dips near creeks/wetlands, and north-facing curves—before committing all routes.",
      "Treat/spot-salt: prioritize bridge decks, school entrance drives, bus loops, and parent drop-off areas before 6:30 AM. Parking lots and sidewalks may be locally slick from refreeze/condensation even if main roads look fine.",
      "Pedestrian safety: advise families that sidewalks may be slick and visibility lower than expected; use reflective gear and allow extra time at crossings.",
      "Decision guidance (Michigan-calibrated): this is NOT a classic snow-day profile. If fog becomes dense enough to push visibility near ~1 mile (or less) on rural routes at 6–8 AM, a delay is more plausible than a closure. Otherwise, operate normally with caution messaging."

Weather.com’s hourly snippet for Rockford, MI shows feels-like around -4°C to -5°C (roughly low 20s°F) near 06:00–08:00 and indicates light snow around that time. The Weather Network’s hourly page shows 12am feels -7°C (~19°F) and 6–7am feels about -2°C to -3°C (~27–26°F), i.e., milder than WeatherAPI. Net: the -20°F wind-chill threshold is NOT supported by the web sources checked, and cold alone is unlikely to drive a closure. The more relevant potential operational issue (if any) would be early-morning visibility/roads from mist/fog (WeatherAPI) versus light snow (Weather.com), but amounts shown on Weather.com in the excerpt are small and not in 'snow day' territory.",

This is not weather-dependent.\n\nIf instead you mean a counterfactual “weather-driven closure if school were in session,” the expert consensus is that closure probability would be very low (≈1–3%): no meaningful snow/ice accumulation is forecast, no extreme wind chill is indicated by web verification, and the main operational hazard is fog/mist with possible localized black ice on bridges/overpasses—typically managed via spot-salting and route checks rather than a district-wide closure in Michigan.

        "shiftReason": "Meteorologically, this is not a snow-day setup for Rockford, MI on Monday 2026-02-16: there is no modeled snowfall/precipitation, winds are modest, and temperatures are typical winter cold (mid-20s at bus time). The only meaningful operational risk is localized fog/mist with high humidity during subfreezing temps, which can produce patchy slick spots on bridges/overpasses (black ice) and reduced visibility in low-lying areas. Those issues can occasionally justify a **delay**, but a **district-wide closure** is unlikely without measurable precip/ice or widespread very low visibility during the 6–8 AM window. I therefore hold snow-day probability in the **very low single digits**.\n\nImportant peer input: the web cross-check notes one source (Weather.com) hinting at **light snow (~0.3\")**. Even if that verifies, that magnitude is far below typical closure thresholds and would only slightly elevate the delay risk; it does not materially change the closure probability."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical/operational standpoint, the dominant factor is that **Rockford Public Schools is already closed on Monday, Feb 16, 2026 for Mid-Winter Break**, so there is effectively no decision to make based on weather. If we hypothetically ignored the calendar and asked whether these conditions *typically* produce a snow day in Rockford/Greater Grand Rapids: the answer is still “very unlikely” because there’s **no forecast accumulating snow or freezing rain**, and winds/temps are within normal winter tolerances. The only meaningful hazard signal is **fog/mist + subfreezing temps near 6–8 AM**, which historically yields patchy black ice risk and reduced visibility—more consistent with a minor delay than a closure.\n\nSo: **~1%** accounts for only edge-case non-weather disruptions (e.g., a localized infrastructure issue) rather than the forecasted weather profile."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Monday 2026-02-16 does not present conditions that typically justify a snow day in West Michigan: no forecast accumulation, no freezing rain signal in the provided data, and winds that are not hazardous. The only credible travel risks are (1) fog/mist reducing visibility and (2) localized black ice from high humidity with subfreezing temps—both of which can be mitigated with early route checks, spot-salting at known trouble spots, and slower bus operations. That profile more often yields normal operations or, at most, a short delay if dense fog/ice is worse than forecast at 06:00–08:00. Therefore I set a very low weather-driven closure probability (~2%).\n\nImportant caveat: per the NEWS analysis, Rockford Public Schools is scheduled closed for Mid-Winter Break on Monday 2/16/2026. If the debate’s ‘snow day probability’ is interpreted as ‘probability school is closed,’ then the correct answer is ~100%—but that would not be attributable to weather/safety conditions."

That makes the ‘snow day’ probability effectively near-zero because there is no closure decision to make.\n\nIf the debate framework requires a weather-only counterfactual, I’d still keep probability extremely low: the forecast shows no accumulating snow/precipitation and no weather alerts, with the only notable risk being fog/mist and potential patchy black ice on untreated surfaces early. That profile occasionally yields a delay, but rarely a closure in West Michigan—especially absent precip."
