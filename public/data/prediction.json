Even if it occurs, it’s not a Thursday morning problem.\n- **No freezing rain indicated for Thu morning** in the provided Thursday-hourly data.\n\n**3) Wind / Blowing snow:**\n- Max wind **~12 mph**, generally below the threshold where we worry about widespread blowing/drifting in Rockford.\n- With **no fresh snow falling** and modest wind, **whiteout/squall** risk looks negligible.\n\n**4) Visibility (the one item to watch):**\n- The dataset shows **1 mile visibility** at times around **5–9 AM** with overcast.\n- With no precip shown, this reads like **low stratus / patchy fog** potential. In Michigan, **1-mile vis alone rarely closes school**—it’s more a caution for rural bus routes and intersections.\n\n**5) NWS alerts:**\n- **None** listed.\n\n## Michigan-style snow day call (Rockford Public Schools area)\n- **Snow/ice impact at 6–8 AM:** minimal.\n- **Plow need:** none.\n- **Primary risk:** pockets of reduced visibility (low clouds/fog), but not severe.\n\n### Estimated closure probability for Thu 2/5/2026\n- **Full closure:** **~3%**\n- **Delay:** **~7%** (mostly if visibility drops well below 1 mile in spots or there’s an unexpected glaze from earlier/untreated patches)\n- **Normal OPEN:** **~90%**\n\nIf you can share: (1) observed road conditions Wednesday evening (2/4) and (2) whether there’s existing snowpack/icy side roads right now, I can tighten that delay vs. open split."

However, Weather.com’s hourly page for Rockford, MI shows markedly colder conditions, including 'Feels Like' values around -25°F to -26°F in the early morning hours (≈5–8 AM). That crosses the -20°F automatic-closure threshold, and also conflicts with the WeatherAPI feed by more than 30°F on apparent temperature. A syndicated NWS-style 7-day text forecast I found does NOT show extreme wind chills for Thursday, but it is not a precise hourly wind-chill table and appears less specific/less directly verifiable for the 6–8 AM window. Because a single credible source (Weather.com) shows ≤ -20°F wind chill, the cold-threshold rule is triggered and should dominate the closure risk assessment until you can reconcile with an official NWS point-and-click/hourly for the exact Rockford, MI point (49341).",

Under the Extreme Cold Rules you provided, ONE credible source showing ≤ -20°F during bus hours is sufficient and is binding; it forces a 90–95% closure prediction regardless of other factors. \n\nCross-checking the other experts supports that, absent the extreme-cold signal, this would be a very low snow-day risk day (open with monitoring): no active snow/ice in the 5–9 AM window, modest winds, only patchy low visibility/black-ice concerns, and no neighboring closures posted yet. Power and infrastructure also do not support closure on their own. \n\nSo the probability is high not because roads/snow look bad, but because the operational decision environment in Michigan strongly prioritizes bus-stop safety at ≤ -20°F wind chills—and administrators/parents will treat Weather.com as authoritative if it continues to show that. Uncertainty remains moderate because the Weather.com data was noted as cached/out-of-sync; however, per your non-negotiable rule, that uncertainty cannot be used to lower the probability below the mandated range.",

The provided Thu hourly forecast shows essentially zero accumulation, modest winds, and wind chills around +11°F during the bus window—conditions that typically do not support a districtwide closure. The only two closure-relevant weather mechanisms I see are (1) patchy dense-ish fog/low stratus causing reduced visibility during 5–9 AM, and (2) residual slick spots from prior freezing drizzle/freezing rain (notably present Wed evening in the feed) that could refreeze and persist on bridges/secondary roads. Those factors raise delay risk a bit, but absent evidence of widespread ice or active snow during the commute, closure remains unlikely."

I’m nudging above the pure 3% baseline (to ~6%) to account for the recurring historical failure mode: patchy black ice from prior freezing drizzle/freezing rain + subfreezing temps, which can occasionally force a conservative closure if bus-route spot checks find widespread untreated slickness. However, absent evidence of meaningful overnight icing or an active snow/ice event in the 6–8 AM window, history strongly favors **open**, with **delay** being the more plausible disruption than a closure."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety lens, the baseline forecast (trace snow, light winds, temps in the teens/20s) points to an ‘open but cautious’ day. The only hazards that plausibly move Rockford toward a closure/delay are (a) patchy refreeze/black ice on bridges and low-traffic roads, and (b) reduced early-morning visibility that could make bus-route operation risky.\n\nI’m *not* comfortable going as low as the met agent’s ~3% closure probability because we have an external operational cue (KCRC “ahead of the ice” messaging) plus modeled low visibility during the bus window—together these can produce a non-trivial chance of a **2-hour delay** even with minimal new precip.\n\nHowever, I’m also *not* comfortable jumping to 90–95% closure solely on the Weather.com scrape shown in WEBWEATHERVERIFIER because: (1) it’s reported as a cached crawl (~5 days old), (2) it conflicts with the provided hourly point forecast by ~30°F, and (3) there’s no corroborating official alert in the data shown (no NWS alerts, no district postings yet). Until reconciled with an official NWS point forecast or updated live hourly data, I treat the extreme wind-chill claim as a high-uncertainty flag rather than a determinative trigger.\n\nNet: I place snow-day (closure) probability at **18%**—mostly representing a delay-or-closure decision driven by patchy ice + low visibility, not snowfall totals. If the extreme wind chills are verified (≤ -20°F during 6–8 AM), I would immediately revise this upward into the high-likelihood closure range per policy thresholds."

Real-time closure boards show no active postings yet, which usually means districts are waiting on morning road checks. The most credible “something could be messy” indicator is Kent County Road Commission’s public preparation for icy roads early Thursday (bridge pretreatment + early crews), which often correlates with patchy slick bridges and rural spots—more consistent with a delay than a full closure. \n\nHowever, the provided WeatherAPI forecast itself shows near-zero precip/snow during the bus window and only trace snow late at night, which is not a typical full snow-day driver in West Michigan. The verifier’s Weather.com wind chill flag would be a major closure driver if it were current/accurate, but it appears based on cached/out-of-sync data and conflicts by ~20–30°F with the rest of the packet; I treat it as a low-reliability outlier until confirmed by official/local NWS hourly. Net: modest but non-trivial chance of a 2-hour delay due to patchy ice/low visibility; low chance of full closure."
