    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford/Kent County, Friday 11/28 itself looks like a marginal-impact day: light snow and freezing drizzle at times, temps in the 20s to near 30°F, 1–2\" of additional snow, and generally good visibility (around 6–10 miles). Roads may be slick in spots early, but this is well within what Michigan schools normally handle, so a snow day for Friday is unlikely based on this data.\n\nThe bigger concern is Saturday 11/29 into early Sunday 11/30. Model-based forecast shows roughly 8–9\" of snow on Saturday alone near Rockford, with hourly rates peaking around 1–2\"/hr during the afternoon and evening and visibility dropping to about 1 mile in heavier bands. Temperatures stay below freezing (mid–20s to upper 20s°F) for 24+ hours, so everything that falls will stick and accumulate, and roads will stay snow-covered and slick unless frequently plowed. Winds increase into the 10–15 mph range with higher gusts, which will contribute to blowing snow and reduced visibility but not true blizzard conditions.\n\nIn Michigan context: Friday 11/28 looks like a typical wintry commute day, not a closure-level event. The Saturday–Sunday storm, however, is a solid snow-maker in line with the NWS Winter Storm Watch, with 6–10\"+ total and poor travel conditions. If school were in session Saturday or early Monday, this would be a strong candidate for delays/closures—especially if heavier bands linger into the pre-dawn hours and plows are still catching up. At this stage, expect difficult travel and potentially hazardous conditions from Saturday morning through Sunday morning, but standard operations on Friday."

        "Winter Storm Watches that verify with 8–10\" over a roughly 12–18 hour window often lead to localized closures when the heaviest banding coincides with pre‑dawn bus times (e.g., 5–8 AM) and secondary roads are still snow‑covered."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford is modestly higher than downtown Grand Rapids and slightly closer to favorable lake‑effect fetch; this often adds an inch or two versus official GRR totals in strong events, enough to push borderline 5–6\" events toward the 7–8\" range locally."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast, this setup resembles notable early‑season West Michigan storms where: (1) a weaker advisory‑level event hits first (your Friday), followed by (2) a Saturday system with strong lake enhancement dropping on the order of 7–10\" in favored bands. Historically for Rockford and similar northern Kent County districts, snow days are uncommon for the Friday‑type pattern you’re seeing now: temps in the 20s°F, light mixed precip overnight, a couple of cm of snow, and winds under 20 mph are well within normal operating limits, and crews typically keep up. For the main storm window (Saturday Nov 29 into early Sunday Nov 30), the combination of a Winter Storm Watch, forecast 20+ cm (~8–9\") in a calendar day, and periods of heavy snow and reduced visibility aligns with past events that have produced difficult travel and, when they coincide with a weekday morning, fairly frequent closures. Here, however, the peak of the storm occurs over a weekend. In past years, when heavy snow falls mainly on a Saturday and Saturday night, schools around Rockford have generally had school as normal on the following Monday unless: (a) totals exceed roughly 10–12\" with significant drifting, (b) road crews are hampered by additional freezing rain/icing, or (c) ongoing lake‑effect continues into Monday morning with 1\"/hr bursts during bus times. Based solely on this dataset: Friday (Nov 28) looks like a typical advisory‑type day with low historical closure rates. Saturday (Nov 29) resembles a respectable winter storm with accumulations in the closure‑relevant 8–10\" range, but timing on a weekend lowers immediate school‑day impact. Historically, similar late‑November Rockford storms yield a moderate chance that conditions could still justify a Monday delay or closure if cleanup is incomplete or banding lingers, but not a high, near‑certain closure probability. Overall confidence in these historical analogs is medium: the pattern is familiar (synoptic storm plus lake enhancement), but details like exact band placement and snow ratios can swing actual totals and road impacts by several inches locally."

    "decision_rationale": "This prediction is for FRIDAY, NOV 28 in Rockford, Michigan.\n\nMeteorology: Friday itself features light snow/freezing drizzle, around 1–2\" of additional snow, temps in the 20s to near 30°F, and generally decent visibility. The 11\" total and Winter Storm Watch are tied mainly to the Saturday–Sunday storm, not the Friday school window.\n\nMichigan thresholds: Less than 4\" of snow with routine winter conditions corresponds to about a 5–15% closure probability. Friday’s setup falls squarely into that category: no heavy rates, manageable visibility, and road crews well within normal capacity.\n\nHistorical patterns: Past events with a weaker Friday system followed by a stronger weekend storm show low closure rates on the advisory-type day, with closures more likely only when the heaviest snow coincides with a weekday morning commute. Here, the main storm peaks on Saturday, so direct school-day disruption is minimal.\n\nSafety: The safety assessment flags moderate risk: slick spots and some compacted snow/ice on side roads and lots, but primary roads remain mostly wet-to-slushy with effective plow/salt response. The expert explicitly notes that conditions do not strongly support a full snow day and that, at most, a short delay could be justified.\n\nSynthesis: Combining these, a full snow day for Friday is unlikely in a Michigan context. To stay calibrated and competitive on Brier score and avoid being overly conservative, I set the probability at 18%, at the high end of the <4\" guideline range but still clearly in the \"school open\" regime.",
