    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford on Tuesday, 2026-01-20, the core winter storm impacts are front-loaded into Monday and very early overnight into around 12–2 AM, with the official Winter Storm Warning and related advisories set to end at 7:00 AM. By typical Michigan standards, conditions during the actual school day look cold but manageable rather than closure-level.\n\nKey school-day factors:\n- **Timing:** Active precip largely shuts down after about 12 AM Tuesday. From roughly 1–7 AM it is dry but very cold (air temps near 8°F, wind chills near -20°F) with leftover blowing/drifting in open areas. This gives plow crews several hours before buses roll to clean up from the warning-level event.\n- **Precipitation:** The only noted precip on 1/20 is a tiny bit of light freezing/drizzle-type precip right at midnight (~0.03 mm) with a decent model “chance of snow” flag, but every hour after 1 AM is dry with 0.00 precip and 0 snow. Total forecast snow for Tuesday itself is **0.0\"**.\n- **Road/ice risk:** Surfaces will be very cold (single digits) and any untreated slush from Monday will refreeze into slick patches, especially rural and secondary routes. However, with dry conditions and multiple pre-dawn hours for salt/plow work, this is a typical post-storm cleanup scenario rather than an ongoing storm during the morning commute.\n- **Wind/visibility:** Winds on Tuesday drop compared to Monday. Peak gusts on the 20th are in the mid-20 mph range rather than near 40 mph. Periodic 1–2 mile visibility early from residual blowing/ground snow is possible, but the daytime forecast shows 6–10 miles of visibility and just persistent clouds/overcast.\n- **Cold/feels-like:** Morning temps around 8°F with wind chills around -20°F at bus time (6–8 AM). This is harsh but within what West Michigan districts frequently run school in, barring extreme wind chill warnings (which are not indicated in the data here).\n- **Warnings context:** The Winter Storm Warnings and Advisories are **scheduled to expire right at school start (7:00 AM Tue)**, which is a key clue that the NWS expects conditions to improve rather than deteriorate through the morning.\n\nPutting this together in a Michigan context (high snow tolerance, but sensitive to active storms and ice):\n- No accumulating snow during school hours\n- Storm ending well before 4 AM with improving winds\n- Very cold but not record-level wind chills\n- Several hours for plows and salt trucks to work before first buses\n\nThis pattern strongly favors **schools being open on Tuesday with possibly some isolated rural delays**, rather than a full system-wide snow day.\n"

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, Tuesday, 2026-01-20 in Rockford looks like the *back side* of a significant winter storm rather than the peak impact day. The heavy snow, blowing snow, and near-blizzard conditions are focused on Monday into the very early hours of Tuesday, with NWS warnings/advisories set to run until 7:00 AM Tuesday. By the time buses would normally run (around 6–9 AM), the forecast shows: (1) temperatures roughly 7–9°F with wind chills about -20°F to -7°F, cold but near the lower bound of what West Michigan districts routinely operate in; (2) winds decreasing from 15–20 mph gusts Monday to mainly 10–15 mph with improving visibility and no additional accumulating snow; and (3) no daytime accumulation and overcast/quiet weather during the school day itself. Historically, Rockford/Kent County has kept school open many times in similar patterns: storm or lake-effect warning on day 1, then a very cold, slick but improving day 2 with plows catching up overnight. Closures on the post-storm day more often occur when: (a) totals exceed roughly 8–10\" with widespread drifting that crews cannot clear in time for rural bus routes, (b) wind chills are below about -15°F to -20°F *for extended periods right at bus time* with additional concerns (e.g., wind, outages), or (c) banded lake-effect refires directly over the I-96/131 corridor during the commute. Your Tuesday forecast does not show new significant snow, strong daytime winds, or sub -20°F wind chills locked in during the entire morning window. Roads will likely be snow‑covered and slick in spots, especially on back roads and bridges, but main routes should be passable with caution if plows are effective overnight. As a result, the historical pattern comparison suggests a relatively low to moderate probability of a *full* snow day on Tuesday itself, with a slightly elevated chance of a delayed start if overnight plowing falls behind in rural areas. Overall confidence in this assessment is medium: a lot hinges on how well roads recover between late Monday evening and early Tuesday morning, which is often the deciding local factor rather than the air temperature or the residual warning end time alone."

No expert argues for high probability of full closure.\n- Community expectation: News intel labels sentiment **\"uncertain/mixed\"**, not strongly in the “everything will be closed” camp.\n\nThese are refinements, not true conflicts; they all point to **manageable but not great** conditions.\n\n3) Plow timing math (storm end → school start):\n- Worst conditions end: **~3:00 AM Tue**.\n- First buses/decisions: ~**5:00–5:30 AM** check, buses rolling ~**6:00–6:30 AM** for Rockford.\n- High school start: ~**7:40 AM**.\n- From safety analyst:\n  - **5:00 AM**: Primary roads already had **at least one plow/salt pass**; secondary roads mostly opened but still rutted; very slick in spots.\n  - **6:00 AM**: Multiple passes on primaries; **“winter normal”** with caution; secondaries improved but still compacted snow and ice patches.\n  - **7:40 AM**: Primaries in **good winter shape**; most secondaries **passable with careful bus driving**; main remaining issues: localized drifting and icy campus/sidewalk spots.\n- Effective cleanup window **from ~3:00 AM to 7:40 AM = ~4.5 hours** of post‑storm work **plus** earlier overnight plowing while it was snowing. That’s ample by Kent County standards for a sub‑8\" event.\n\n4) Ice presence (critical factor):\n- Meteorologist follow‑up:\n  - Tiny **freezing rain** around **midnight only**, then **0.0 mm precip** and **0.0\" snow** from 3–9 AM.\n  - 4–8 AM: **Overcast, dry, no freezing drizzle**, will_it_rain = 0, will_it_snow = 0.\n- Safety analyst: **High ice risk** from **refreeze** on very cold pavement, especially bridges, intersections, parking lots, and untreated secondaries.\n- So: **Yes, ice is present**, but as **black ice/refreeze**, **not** as an ongoing ice storm or fresh glaze falling during the commute.\n- In Michigan terms, that’s serious but **routine winter hazard**, not closure‑by‑itself unless combined with poor plow progress or active precip.\n\n5) Neighboring districts:\n- News intel (fresh scan of TV lists + district sites):\n  - **No neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kenowa Hills, Northview, Comstock Park)** have posted **Tuesday Jan 20 closures/delays** yet.\n  - Forest Hills is closed **Monday** for weather, but **no decision posted for Tuesday**.\n  - Rockford’s only listed closure is **Monday (MLK/PD)**, not weather‑related.\n- Per your weighting rule: **3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20%** bump. Here we have **0 neighbors confirmed for Tuesday** → **no upward adjustment**. If anything, the lack of early closures nudges the probability slightly **down**, but I treat that mainly as **no positive bump** rather than a strong negative.\n\n6) What would make this prediction wrong?\n- **Upside miss (should have predicted higher chance of closure)** if:\n  - Plow crews fall behind badly, especially on rural secondaries, due to drifting or staffing/equipment issues, such that **4–5 AM checks** find many roads barely passable.\n  - The small midnight freezing rain signal is **underestimated** and creates more widespread glaze, especially on hills/intersections, making buses unsafe despite no new precip.\n  - An unmodeled **lake‑effect band re‑flares** directly over Kent County during the 4–7 AM window, cutting vis below 1/4 mile with new accumulation.\n  - Power outages or building/boiler failures in extreme cold (not indicated by current intel) force closures for reasons unrelated to roads.\n- **Downside miss (probability should be even lower)** if:\n  - Overnight clearing goes **better than expected**, with roads largely wet‑dry instead of packed snow, and wind chills stay on the less extreme end of guidance.\n  - Neighbor districts and Rockford post **“we’re open”** messaging or only consider a few isolated delays.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per your directive):\n- **Meteorology – 35% weight**: \n  - Core input: **no new accumulating snow**, **post‑storm pattern**, **winds easing**, and **Warning ending at 7 AM**. This strongly pulls the base probability **down**. On Michigan thresholds alone: 0\" new snow on the day + cold = roughly **10–20%**.\n- **Safety – 25% weight**:\n  - Risk labeled **moderate**, but with clear language that conditions are **“cold but operable”** and that **a full snow day would typically require worse conditions** than forecast.\n  - Suggests possible **1–2 hour delay**, not system‑wide closure. This supports a probability in the **low 20s or below**.\n- **History – 20% weight**:\n  - Similar patterns give **0.10–0.25 snow‑day rate**; seasonal context nudges **slightly lower (-0.05)**.\n  - Rockford historically **stays open** in mornings like this unless totals are extreme or cold is more severe.\n  - This anchors the range around **15–20%**.\n- **News Intelligence – 20% weight (secret weapon)**:\n  - No Tuesday closures yet among neighbours → **no +15–20% domino bump**.\n  - Community sentiment described as **mixed/uncertain**, not “everyone expects a snow day.”\n  - Regional media emphasize hazards but not universal closures.\n  - This keeps the probability **near the lower end** of the historical/meteorological ranges, not higher.\n\nNUMERICAL SYNTHESIS & THRESHOLDS\n- Base from meteorology/thresholds: **~12–18%** (0\" new snow, significant but not catastrophic prior storm, high Michigan tolerance).\n- Safety: supports **operable with possible delays**, consistent with **15–25%** for a *full* snow day.\n- History: analogs **15%, 10%, 25%** → rough mean ≈ **17%**, seasonal adj pulls that down a bit.\n- News intel: **no closures, no strong “it’s a lock” sentiment** → stay at **low end** of that cluster.\n- Applying your Michigan thresholds:\n  - We are effectively in the **<4\" new snow on decision day** bucket, which you peg at **5–15%**. The prior storm raises concern slightly, so I move **slightly above 15%** but stay close.\n\nFinal call: **18% probability of a full snow day** for Rockford on Tue Jan 20, 2026.\n- This is **decisively low**, outside the 40–60% band you want to avoid.\n- It reflects that a closure is **not impossible** (especially if roads under‑perform expectations) but **clearly not the favored outcome**.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS",
