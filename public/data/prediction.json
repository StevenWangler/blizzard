Wind chills during 6–8 AM are roughly 10–11°F—cold, but far above Michigan closure thresholds (not near -15°F or -20°F). Winds are modest (generally 5–10 mph early, increasing late morning), so blowing/drifting snow and whiteout issues are not expected. With essentially no accumulating snow and no measurable ice during the morning, roads should be in typical winter condition and schools should almost certainly remain open. Snow-day probability: ~5% (mainly only if unforeseen glazing/black ice develops from localized freezing drizzle not captured in the hourly precip)."

The meteorologist clarification explains how trace freezing drizzle can occur under low stratus even when hourly QPF rounds to zero—so a patchy black-ice scenario is plausible, but most likely isolated (bridges/overpasses/untreated secondary roads) rather than widespread.\n\nMichigan districts typically do not close for trace snow or non-extreme cold, and there are no verified neighboring-district closures or official signals suggesting Rockford is preparing to close. Roads/operations are expected to be normal with spot-treatment capacity, and power outages are minimal systemwide with no evidence of a localized surge.\n\nRecommendation: **OPEN with monitoring** (not a full closure).
