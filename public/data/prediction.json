    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford (Kent County) on Monday, December 29, 2025, a strong system transitions from heavy rain to sleet and then snow overnight. Temperatures fall from the upper 30s around midnight to the 20s by the morning commute, with wind chills near or below 0°F at times. From roughly 2–4 AM, rain changes to sleet and then snow as temps drop below freezing. Between about 3 AM and early afternoon, very strong WSW–W winds (sustained 25–30 mph, gusts potentially 45–55 mph per NWS), combined with snow and existing wet surfaces, will create rapidly deteriorating road conditions: flash freeze potential, drifting, and locally whiteout-level visibility (forecast vis often at or near 0 miles from about 3 AM through midday). Total new snow for Rockford looks on the order of 2–4\" (advisory-level), but nearby counties under Winter Storm Warnings will see heavier amounts. In a Michigan context, the snowfall amount alone is not extreme, but the combination of: (1) overnight rain changing to snow/flash freeze right into the start of the day, (2) very strong winds causing blowing and drifting, (3) visibility frequently below 1 mile and at times near zero, and (4) an active Winter Weather Advisory specifically mentioning impacts to both the Monday morning and evening commutes, all points to a high risk of dangerous travel during normal school start times.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for snow but low tolerance for ice + whiteout/blowing conditions during commute hours, these conditions are favorable for significant disruptions. Based on this forecast setup, the probability of a full snow day (closure) for Rockford-area schools on Monday, 2025-12-29 is **high (around 70–80%)**, with an additional chance of at least a **delay** if they do not fully close. The main drivers are hazardous roads from pre-dawn through midday, strong winds, and very poor visibility rather than extreme snow totals alone."

Key risk factors include: (1) timing—snow, sleet, and then blowing snow ramping up between roughly 2–8 AM during bus and commuter hours; (2) strong winds—frequent gusts near 40–45 mph, locally higher, capable of creating ground blizzard conditions and dropped visibilities under a mile (the gridded forecast is showing near‑zero visibility for many morning and midday hours); (3) a wet‑to‑frozen transition that can create an icy substrate before snow begins drifting; and (4) official NWS messaging calling out impacts to both the Monday morning and evening commutes in Kent County, while counties just west and north are already under Winter Storm Warnings. Historically in this corridor, districts like Rockford do not close for 2–4\" of snow alone, but they are much more likely to cancel or at least strongly consider it when advisory/near‑warning winds, blowing/drifting, and sub‑mile visibilities coincide with the morning commute. Taking all that into account, this setup looks historically similar to events where Rockford and nearby districts close roughly half the time. Conditions are marginal for a full‑day closure on snowfall alone but solidly in the range where a snow day or, at minimum, a delay becomes a realistic outcome, especially if overnight banding focuses over northern Kent County or if the worst visibility lines up squarely with the 6–9 AM window."

There are no public, weather‑specific closure announcements for that day – closures are baked into the calendar.\n\n• Weather‑wise, a significant system is crossing Michigan Dec. 28–29. Forecasts and NWS‑based coverage indicate rain changing to snow Sunday night, followed by lake‑effect snow and very strong winds Monday across West Michigan. Rockford’s Monday forecast calls for around an inch of new snow locally but with 25–40 mph NW winds and higher gusts, which can cause blowing/drifting and difficult travel at times, especially in rural areas.\n\n• Regional articles and NWS graphics emphasize heavier snow and even blizzard‑like conditions in some northern Lake Michigan coastal and snow‑belt counties, with winter storm watches/warnings and 3–6\"+ accumulations plus 50–60+ mph gusts there. Rockford is within the broader West Michigan impact zone but not in the bull’s‑eye for the heaviest snow based on current guidance.\n\n• Consumers Energy’s statewide outage tools show typical scattered outages but no evidence (as of Sunday afternoon, Dec. 28) of a large, localized Rockford outage event. No substantial community chatter or official alerts were found that would suggest extraordinary local disruption beyond the expected hazardous winter driving conditions.\n\nNet: Hazardous winter weather is likely around Rockford on Monday, Dec. 29, with strong winds and some snow, but Rockford Public Schools and most neighbors are already on winter break, so there is effectively no separate snow‑day decision in play for that date."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist, historian, safety analyst, and news intel all agree that:\n  • A significant winter event will impact Rockford early Monday, Dec. 29, with rain changing to snow overnight.\n  • Temperatures fall below freezing before and during the morning commute window, creating flash‑freeze/ice risk on previously wet surfaces.\n  • Winds are strong (25–30 mph sustained, gusts up to ~45–55 mph) with blowing and drifting snow and periods of very low visibility.\n  • Travel during the early‑morning through late‑morning period will be hazardous, especially on rural and open roads.\n  • Nearby counties to the west/north are under Winter Storm Warnings; Kent County (including Rockford) is under a Winter Weather Advisory.\n  • Crucially: Rockford Public Schools (and most neighboring districts) are on Winter Break on Dec. 29, so there is no normal school day to cancel.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorologist: Places the *weather‑based* closure probability around 70–80% if school were in session (weighing timing, wind, whiteouts heavily).\n- Historian: Historical analogs give about a 50–60% closure rate for similar events when school is in session.\n- Safety analyst: Rates risk level as \"severe\" for travel, strongly implying that a closure or long delay would be advisable *if* school were scheduled.\n- News intel: Emphasizes that there is NO SCHOOL due to Winter Break, and that neighboring districts are also on break—no live closure choices are being made.\n\nThe only real \"disagreement\" is conceptual: the first three implicitly assume a standard school day is possible; the news intel clarifies that operationally there is no snow‑day decision because the calendar already has no classes.\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions: ~2:00 AM – 1:00 PM.\n- Around Rockford, snow and heavy blowing/drifting are ongoing through and beyond the 7:40 AM start‑time proxy.\n- That means there are effectively 0 hours of post‑storm cleanup before the normal start of school; plows would be working *during* peak conditions (strong winds, near‑zero visibility, active snowfall/blowing).\n- In a normal session this would support a relatively high closure probability; but here it mainly informs travel advice rather than a snow‑day call.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Yes: high ice/flash‑freeze risk.\n  • Wet roads from prior rain.\n  • Temperatures dropping into upper 20s by the commute.\n  • Safety analyst explicitly flags ice formation risk as \"high\" and notes flash‑ice potential on untreated surfaces.\n- This would substantially elevate closure odds in a normal school scenario.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel shows:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: Official calendar says \"NO SCHOOL – Winter Break\" Dec. 22, 2025 – Jan. 2, 2026, including Monday, Dec. 29.\n  • Cedar Springs: Also on Winter Break through Jan. 2.\n  • Regional calendars for Kent ISD districts: Broadly indicate Winter Break during this week; no active snow‑day announcements, just scheduled no‑school days.\n- Therefore, there are effectively many neighboring districts \"closed,\" but for scheduled break, not as weather‑driven snow days. The Michigan thresholds rule about \"+15–20% for 3+ neighboring districts closed\" does **not** apply because the closures are not weather decisions.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Overestimation risk (predicting a snow day that doesn’t exist):\n  • Ignoring the calendar and treating this as a standard session day would inflate the snow‑day probability toward 60–80%, which would be logically incorrect given that no snow‑day decision is being made.\n- Underestimation risk (missing a de facto closure):\n  • The district could, in theory, cancel scheduled events (practices, camps, extracurriculars) because of weather. But the question is about a **school snow day**, which is already overridden by Winter Break.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND WEIGHTING\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Weather alone strongly supports at least a delay and likely full closure if school were in session: 2–4\" of snow, flash freeze, whiteouts, Winter Weather Advisory during commute hours, and 40–55 mph gusts. This suggests a notional 70–80% *conditional* closure probability on a normal school day.\n- Safety (25%): Safety assessment marks road and walking conditions as severe, with high ice risk and poor visibility from before the morning commute into midday. That aligns with a strong recommendation to avoid normal school operations during that period.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs give roughly a 50–60% closure rate for similar patterns when school is in session, slightly moderating the meteorologist’s 70–80% estimate but still clearly in the closure‑is‑plausible range.\n- News Intelligence (20%): This is decisive for the **actual** question. It confirms there is no regular school scheduled (Winter Break) for Rockford and neighbors on Dec. 29, so the operational snow‑day probability collapses regardless of how likely a closure would be if school were in session.\n\nGiven the competition context (Brier score, being decisive), the correct interpretation is:\n- Conditional on school being in session: the probability of a closure would be high, roughly 65–75%.\n- Unconditional, given that school is *not* in session: the probability of an official snow day is effectively near 0. I assign 5% to cover edge‑case interpretations (e.g., the district branding cancellations of break‑week programs as a \"snow day\"), but for the standard K‑12 calendar definition this is essentially no snow day.\n\nTherefore, the final snow day probability is set to **5% with high confidence**, driven primarily by calendar status from News Intelligence, with meteorology, safety, and historical data reinterpreted as travel‑risk context rather than closure odds.",
