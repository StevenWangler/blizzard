    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Overall, this setup looks like a classic late‑December West Michigan rain‑to‑snow event with strong west-northwest winds, bursts of moderate snow, and widespread blowing and drifting rather than a high‑end blizzard or ice storm. Key school-closure triggers in Michigan—ice glazing, 8–10\"+ new snow, extreme wind chills below about -15°F—are not strongly met in this forecast. Road crews are likely to be out all night transitioning from Sunday’s heavy rain to plowing and salting as snow begins early Monday. Conditions for the Monday morning (December 29, 2025) commute appear to be: temperatures dropping just below freezing around bus time, wind gusts in the 35–50 mph range, and snow becoming moderate between ~6–10 AM with localized poor visibility. Historically, Rockford and similar districts have often remained open in comparable setups, especially when snow totals fall into the 3–6\" range and ice is limited. However, the combination of fresh slush refreezing, strong winds, and near-zero modeled visibility bands does introduce some risk of very difficult travel on select rural routes and on US‑131 at exactly the wrong time of day. Balancing these factors, the historical pattern suggests a relatively low-to-moderate snow-day likelihood (something like 20–30%), with slightly elevated odds if overnight trends increase snowfall totals or if road temperatures cool faster than expected and create more widespread ice. My confidence in this historical-context assessment is medium: the pattern is familiar and within Michigan’s usual operating range, but small changes in band placement, snowfall rate, or overnight road treatment could make conditions either routine for West Michigan or briefly hazardous enough to push Rockford toward a delay or closure decision."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Hazardous travel during the early morning through midday on Dec. 29 due to moderate snow, strong W–NW winds (20–27 mph, gusts 30+), blowing snow, and near-zero visibility at times.\n- Safety analyst: Labels risk as HIGH, with severe morning commute impact and significant afternoon impact; states conditions are unsafe for normal school traffic and recommends full-day closure or at least a delay if school were in session.\n- Historian: Confirms this is a classic late-December West Michigan rain-to-snow, windy setup. While totals are not extreme, the timing (heavier snow 6–10 AM, strong winds, poor visibility) can create travel difficulty, especially on rural routes.\n- News intel: Confirms a significant winter storm is expected across the region with hazardous travel at times.\nAll four agree that: (a) Dec. 28–29 features a legitimate winter storm, and (b) road and visibility conditions during normal school commute hours would be materially degraded.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Meteorology/Safety vs. History:\n  • Meteorology and Safety treat the event as high operational risk during commute windows, favoring at least delays and likely closure under normal school operations.\n  • Historical analysis notes that for 3–6\" type events without major ice or 8–10\"+ totals, Rockford often stays open, giving only about 20–30% historical snow-day rate for similar setups.\n- News intel vs. pure weather: News intel effectively overrides the need for a snow-day decision by confirming: Rockford and neighboring districts are already closed for Winter Break on Dec. 29; there is no scheduled school session.\nThus, the only real disagreement is about how likely a closure would be IF school were scheduled. But on the actual calendar, the NEWS finding removes that decision entirely.\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window (Safety): 05:00–14:00 on Dec. 29.\n- Meteorology: Moderate snow ramps up around 6–8 AM and continues with blowing snow and near-zero visibility bands much of the school day.\n- That implies:\n  • By a typical first-bell time around 7:40 AM, snow is ongoing and likely intensifying, not ending.\n  • There are effectively 0 hours between snow ending and the start of the school day. Plows would be working DURING the worst of the event, with roads repeatedly re-covered by blowing snow.\n- Under normal operations this is a clear red flag and strongly supports at least a delay or closure.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorology: Temperatures drop from just above freezing to the 20s with 24 hours below freezing and strong wind; narrative notes roads \"icy all day\" with slush refreezing.\n- Safety assessment: \"ice_formation_risk\": HIGH; notes slick, compacted snow and patches of ice on all surfaces (roads, lots, sidewalks).\n- Historian: Mentions earlier soaking rain changing to snow, with potential for slush to freeze as temps slip below freezing around bus time.\n- Conclusion: While there is no classic freezing rain glaze, there IS a significant ice component from refrozen slush and compacted snow – operationally similar to an ice/slick-conditions event for drivers and walkers.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel: Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD are all on winter break Dec. 22–31, just like Rockford. There are no independent snow-day closure announcements for Dec. 29 because there is no school scheduled.\n- That effectively means:\n  • ALL neighboring districts are already \"closed\" for calendar reasons, not as emergency snow days.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Overestimating closure risk:\n  • Weather could trend slightly less intense: bands shift, giving Rockford only light–moderate snow and better visibility; roads end up merely slushy but manageable for Michigan.\n  • Historical behavior suggests Rockford sometimes stays open in 3–6\" windy events if roads are treated well.\n- Underestimating closure risk (hypothetical if school were in session):\n  • Lake enhancement or banding could raise totals above 4–6\" into 6\"+ with frequent whiteouts, pushing the setup closer to the \"true closure\" historical pattern (0.7 closure rate).\n  • Ice from rapid refreeze could be more widespread than modeled, making roads treacherous even with modest snow totals.\n- For the ACTUAL decision, however, the dominant risk of being \"wrong\" would be misreading the calendar. News intel is clear: Rockford is on winter break with no school Dec. 29. That makes a weather-based snow-day prediction moot for that date. The only way to be truly wrong would be if the calendar information is incorrect, which is unlikely given multiple consistent official sources.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35%): Indicates hazardous, poorly timed snow and wind with near-zero visibility at commute time and icy roads. On its own, for a 2–3\" event with strong winds and ice risk, this would argue for roughly a 40–60% closure probability under normal operations.\n- Safety (25%): Assigns HIGH risk, severe morning-commute impact, and explicitly recommends closure or at least a delay. If weighted alone, this would push toward 60–75% closure probability under normal operations.\n- History (20%): For similar events (3–6\" snow + wind, limited ice), Rockford usually remains open, giving only ~20–30% closure odds. This pulls the probability down compared with the raw meteorology and safety signals.\n- News Intelligence (20% – SECRET WEAPON): Provides decisive contextual information: Rockford and neighboring districts are already closed for Winter Break on Dec. 29; there is no school to cancel. That effectively converts the practical probability of a \"snow day\" decision on Dec. 29 to near 100% closure in calendar terms.\n\nSYNTHESIS INTO A FINAL PROBABILITY\n1. Hypothetical world IF school were scheduled Dec. 29:\n   - Baseline from Michigan thresholds:\n     • Snow forecast: roughly 2–3\" (possibly locally more in bands) – under 4\", which usually corresponds to 5–15% closure.\n     • But add: poor timing (worst from 5–14:00), strong winds, blowing snow, high ice risk, and near-zero visibility bands. These factors push it up toward the 4–6\" with good timing category in impact terms.\n   - Balancing experts under that hypothetical:\n     • Meteorology (35%) and Safety (25%) lean clearly TOWARD closure/delay because of timing + ice + visibility.\n     • History (20%) leans AGAINST frequent closures for similar systems.\n     • Without the calendar factor, a reasonable integrated estimate would have been around 45–55% closure probability – a genuinely uncertain case that depends heavily on final band placement and road-crew performance.\n\n2. Actual world WITH winter break in effect:\n   - Rockford and neighbors are pre-closed due to the academic calendar.\n   - From the student perspective, Dec. 29 is functionally indistinguishable from a snow day: there is no school.\n   - Therefore, the operative question becomes: \"What is the probability that students do not have school due to the combination of calendar and weather?\" That probability is essentially 100%, with a tiny residual uncertainty about the correctness or last-minute change of the calendar.\n\nDECISION\n- Taking into account all four experts and the competition context (needing a sharp, well-calibrated probability and avoiding unnecessary 40–60% hedging), I set:\n  • Snow day (no school) probability for Monday, Dec. 29, 2025 in Rockford, Michigan: 95%.\n- Rationale for 95% (not 100%):\n  • 95% acknowledges the strong, corroborated evidence from official calendars (News intel) while leaving a small 5% margin in case of calendar misinterpretation or special programming (e.g., an unscheduled event or practice) that could still occur despite break.\n  • Weather-only uncertainty is irrelevant to whether school is in session, but is relevant for travel, so the remaining 5% reflects only theoretical administrative or scheduling anomalies, not forecast doubt.\n\nIn summary: under normal school operations this would be a borderline but weather-risk-leaning case. However, because Rockford is on Winter Break, the effective probability that students have school is near zero. Thus, from a student-centered \"Do we have to go to school?\" perspective, a snow day outcome is overwhelmingly likely on Dec. 29, 2025.\n",

        "Ensure all buildings, lots, and sidewalks are monitored for drifting and ice during and after the storm to prevent damage and to prepare for staff returning later in the week.",
        "Communicate clearly with families that while school is on break, hazardous travel may still affect athletics, practices, or extracurricular events; provide explicit guidance on any cancellations or time changes.",
        "Review and, if needed, update the district’s criteria and communication plan for weather-related closures and delays before classes resume Jan. 5."
      ],
      "for_residents": [
        "Assume hazardous travel at times from early Monday morning through early afternoon: allow extra time, reduce speeds, and avoid unnecessary trips during the 6 AM–2 PM window if possible.",
        "Expect slick roads and walkways due to refreezing slush and compacted snow; use traction aids (proper footwear, salt/sand on driveways and sidewalks).",
        "If you must travel, especially on rural north–south roads or US-131, be prepared for sudden drops in visibility from blowing snow; keep headlights on, increase following distance, and have a winter emergency kit in your vehicle.",
        "Monitor local media (WOOD TV8, WZZM 13, Fox 17) and NWS updates for any changes in snow intensity, band placement, or wind forecasts, especially if you plan longer trips.",
        "If you have teen drivers, strongly consider limiting their driving during the worst of the storm and encourage them to avoid secondary, untreated roads."
      ],
      "for_authorities": [
        "Coordinate plow and salt operations to prioritize major corridors (US-131, primary county roads) beginning before 5 AM Monday and continuing through the late-morning peak in snow and blowing snow.",
        "Give particular attention to rural, open-field stretches prone to drifting and whiteouts; consider additional passes or spot treatments on known problem hills and curves.",
        "Use public communication channels (county, city, and road commission social media/web) to set expectations about hazardous travel windows and to discourage nonessential travel during peak conditions.",
        "Stay in close contact with utilities and emergency services to respond quickly if drifting, low visibility, or isolated outages impact access routes.",
        "After the storm, evaluate performance and trouble spots to refine route priorities before school resumes in January, as similar setups are climatologically common later in winter."
