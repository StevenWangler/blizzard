The only item to monitor is a possible brief visibility dip around 6–7 AM (forecast 1 mile) and a tiny late-evening freezing-rain signal (~11 PM) that occurs well after dismissal and appears extremely light (0.01 mm). \n\nKey bus-time (6–8 AM) details:\n- Temps: ~25–28°F.\n- Wind chills: ~16–19°F (NOT a cold-closure situation; far above -10°F/-15°F/-20°F triggers).\n- Precip: none.\n- Visibility: forecast down to ~1 mile at 6–7 AM (could mean patchy fog/low stratus); not typically enough alone to close, but could cause slower travel on back roads.\n\nMichigan closure calibration:\n- Snow: 0\" expected during the morning commute → closure probability stays very low.\n- Ice: none during commute; a very light freezing-rain mention around 11 PM is too late and too minimal to drive a Tuesday closure.\n- Wind: gusts generally 20–28 mph late morning through evening; without fresh snow, drifting/whiteout is not a concern.\n\nBottom line for snow day prediction (Tue 2026-02-10): Very low probability of a closure. If anything, this is an \"open, maybe a little slower commute\" kind of winter day."

If the freezing-rain potential shifts into the pre-dawn hours and becomes more than a trace, that would jump quickly into the 30–60% range (ice is the equalizer in Michigan), but your current timing keeps that risk mostly after school."

      "Primary roads (US-131/M-44 type routes) should be in good shape by bus rollout (~6:30 AM) given no ongoing precip and standard MDOT/county treatment. Secondary/residential roads may have a few untreated glazed spots in shaded areas and at stop intersections.",
      "Afternoon dismissal looks manageable: temps climb into the mid/upper 30s with breezy W/NW winds. Roads should continue improving (melting/evaporation), so an early release is unlikely based on this forecast.",
      "Late evening (around 11 PM) shows a signal for light freezing rain/freezing drizzle (very small QPF ~0.01 mm). That’s not a Tuesday school-hours problem, but it is a ‘setup’ concern for Wednesday morning if it expands or arrives earlier than forecast."

Weather context in Michigan includes recent extreme cold and advisories earlier in the week, but one article indicates a warming trend with temps expected to rise above freezing by Tue Feb 10—often lowering closure odds unless a fresh snow/ice event is occurring overnight. One notable infrastructure signal: statewide outage trackers show Kent County currently has elevated outage counts compared to other counties (poweroutage.us), which can sometimes influence school operations if outages are concentrated locally, but this is not Rockford-specific without map-level confirmation. Net: at this moment, the strongest signals point to ‘no announced closure yet’ rather than an emerging closure trend for Feb 10."

Web cross-checking was hampered by inconsistent Weather.com cached hourly pages (different crawls show very different temperatures/feels-like), and I did not successfully retrieve a Rockford point forecast/hourly table from NWS nor an AccuWeather RealFeel page in this run. Of the web snippets that *did* show hourly feels-like, the coldest visible values were around -3°F (Weather.com page segment displayed for a different cold scenario/day), still above the -20°F threshold. Bottom line: based on the data successfully verified here, there is *no evidence* of ≤ -20°F wind chill for Tue morning in Rockford, MI, and the WeatherAPI forecast suggests a relatively mild (for February) morning with no snow accumulation signal.",

The only legitimate risk is localized (not district-wide): possible freezing fog/patchy black ice on bridges and untreated residential roads plus a brief modeled ~1-mile visibility dip near daybreak. Those conditions can justify extra caution or, at most, a limited 2-hour delay if they verify more widespread than expected—but historically they do not usually produce a full closure in West Michigan without an actual icing precipitation event or widespread untreated-surface glaze. Therefore, the optimal Brier-score stance is a low single-digit closure probability, acknowledging a small chance of a delay-type decision if morning spot checks look worse than forecast.",

The morning commute window shows dry conditions with manageable winds and temps. The only meaningful meteorological risk is localized fog/freezing-fog and patchy black ice potential given high humidity and subfreezing temps, which supports a small—but non-zero—closure/delay probability. Net: low single-digit chance of a snow day, with a slightly higher chance of a minor delay than a full closure."

Historically, those ingredients yield school in session. I’m not at ~0% only because (a) visibility dips to ~1 mile near daybreak with subfreezing temps (black-ice/freezing-fog edge case), and (b) there is a freezing-rain/drizzle hint late evening that—if it shifts earlier and verifies more strongly than forecast—can rapidly change the decision. Net: low single-digit closure odds; I’ll place it at 7%."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety-operations standpoint, Tuesday 2026-02-10 looks like an “open” day with minor winter hazards rather than a snow day. The commute risk is dominated by patchy black ice potential and short-lived low visibility around 6–7 AM. Those conditions can increase incident rates on untreated back roads, but the absence of active precip and the modest wind/temperature profile make a district-wide closure unlikely. I’m holding the closure probability in the high single digits mainly to account for (a) fog/freezing fog producing more widespread glaze than modeled, (b) any earlier-than-forecast freezing drizzle, or (c) unmodeled residual slickness from prior days that combines with the morning refreeze."

The only plausible pathway to a closure would be an overnight forecast shift toward freezing drizzle during the pre-dawn commute, or a localized but significant fog/freezing-fog road safety issue that prompts widespread delays. Given current info, that pathway looks unlikely, so I’m in low single digits, nudged slightly above “near-zero” because of the visibility dip + recent regional icing context."
