That combo can create patchy-to-widespread black ice on untreated roads, bridges, and especially rural low-lying routes even with zero measurable precipitation. Winds are light (generally 4–10 mph), so the fog is likely to linger into the early morning hours rather than mix out quickly. Wind chills during typical bus time are in the mid-20s°F (not remotely near Michigan cold-closure thresholds), so any closure risk is driven almost entirely by visibility and slick spots. In a Michigan-calibrated decision sense: this looks much more like a ‘delay-worthy’ setup than a true snow day—IF the freezing fog persists into the 6–8 AM commute window and vis drops below ~1/4–1/2 mile on key routes. Otherwise, with no falling snow, no accumulating precip, and manageable winds, most districts would try to run on time with caution unless roads glaze overnight."

Calibrated to Michigan practice: I’d peg **full closure risk for Mon 2026-02-16 around ~10–20%** under a ‘freezing fog/patchy glaze’ scenario, rising sharply (to ~50–70%) only if freezing drizzle/ice accretion actually appears or widespread untreated-road icing is reported pre-dawn. Confidence: **medium** because the key differentiator (actual ice accretion vs. just fog/mist) often isn’t well-resolved this far out and can change quickly overnight."

Here, the weather packet emphasizes freezing fog/mist with temps near 30–32°F and no precipitation/snow accumulation in the provided forecast period.\n\nHowever, the dominant historical factor is actually procedural: peer NEWS analysis indicates Rockford Public Schools is *already scheduled closed* on **Monday, Feb 16, 2026** for Mid-Winter Break, with school resuming **Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026**. If that’s correct, the chance of a *weather-caused* closure decision on that date is effectively near-zero; I’m leaving a small residual (3%) to cover edge cases (e.g., a different institution than RPS, a mistaken calendar scrape, or an off-calendar district office event being canceled).\n\nIf we ignore the calendar and ask “would these conditions historically cause a closure if it were a normal school day?”, I’d still keep full-closure odds low (roughly 10–20% in a worst-case freezing-fog + patchy-glaze verification), with a more meaningful *delay* probability.

That scenario is possible but not the climatological “default,” so I’m trimming my prior 12% down to **8%** for a full closure, while implicitly viewing a *delay* as more likely than a closure.\n\nIf Monday’s actual hourly forecast introduces freezing drizzle, a 2–4°F colder temp profile, or confirmed dense fog (<1/4–1/2 mile) during the decision window, I’d raise this quickly into the ~15–30% range.

From a safety/operations standpoint, that’s decisive: the practical probability that students will not be transported / buildings won’t run normal instruction on that date is therefore very high. I set **88%** (not 100%) only because I’m not personally verifying the district calendar here and there’s always a small chance the query is about a different school/entity than RPS.\n\n2) **Weather-driven closure probability (if it *were* a normal school day):** Based on the meteorology + infrastructure + my own safety read, I’d keep this **low-to-moderate (~10–20%)**, with a higher chance of a **delay**. The credible safety pathway is: freezing fog persisting into the **Mon 04:30–09:00** commute window causing **widespread** low visibility and enough glaze/black ice reports to make bus operations unsafe. But with no forecast snow/precip totals and modest winds, the more common outcome is “run with caution” or “delay,” not full closure.\n\nBecause the user asked for a single ‘snow day probability estimate’ and the packet includes strong evidence of a scheduled closure, my headline number reflects the *parent-facing* probability of ‘no school Monday,’ while explicitly noting the weather-only probability would be much lower.",
