The key for the TARGET school day (Monday 2/23) is that the modeled snow in this dataset is not focused overnight Sunday night into Monday morning bus time; the more organized snow showers occur late Sunday morning through early afternoon, totaling roughly ~1 inch (around 3 cm) for the day. With that timing, Rockford-area plows and road crews have ample time Sunday afternoon/evening to clean up, and there is no ice signal here. Wind chills around bus time are cold but not near Michigan closure thresholds (roughly upper teens to near 20F). Bottom line: based on THIS dataset alone, Monday 2/23 has a low snow-day risk; the more realistic concern would be a few slick spots early Monday from refreeze/leftover slush rather than an active storm."

Historically in Michigan, ~1–3 inches of snow leads to closures only about 5–15% of the time; I’d center Rockford near ~10% for a *full* Monday (2026-02-23) closure given what you’ve shown. The main upside risk (raising odds) would be a narrow, higher-intensity snow shower band near the Monday AM commute or evidence of glazing/refreeze on untreated roads; the main downside risk (lowering odds) is snow ending well before Monday morning with roads drying/treated."

    "verification_summary": "From your WeatherAPI data, Rockford, MI is not near the -20°F wind-chill closure trigger: the coldest 'feels like' shown for Sunday 2026-02-22 is about 16–22°F (e.g., ~20°F around 7 AM; ~16.5–16.9°F late evening). Snowfall in that Sunday period is light (~3 cm / ~1.2 in) with moderate winds (generally ~9–14 mph). That would suggest a LOW cold-closure risk (nowhere near -20°F) and only a modest snow/travel impact.\n\nWeb cross-checking did not produce a clean, date-specific Monday 2026-02-23 6–8 AM 'feels like' for Rockford, MI from the major providers in the snippets returned. The Weather.com hourly snippet we captured shows temperatures in the 40s/50s (and 'feels like' near 29°F at 8 AM), which conflicts sharply with your WeatherAPI and is very likely not the Feb 23, 2026 view for Rockford, MI. The NWS (weather.gov) page retrieved is a *historic* January 2026 wind-chill report (credible, but not a forecast for Feb 23). Weather Underground and other aggregator pages retrieved also appear to be showing different days than Feb 23.\n\nBottom line: I do NOT see any evidence (from what was retrievable here) that the -20°F wind-chill threshold will be exceeded for Rockford, MI. But because the web pulls were not clearly pinned to 2026-02-23 hourly data, the web verification is incomplete for the specific school-morning window.",

The meteorologist’s pattern-based estimate for Monday morning is dry or flurries at most, with wind chills ~15–20°F—far from the -15°F to -20°F and ≤-20°F closure triggers.\n\nThe main disagreement/uncertainty is whether FOX17’s “ice storm prep” messaging implies *more* icing risk than the Rockford point forecast shows. After clarification, both meteorology and infrastructure see the more likely ice mechanism as *refreeze* (wet/slushy residue Sunday → patchy black ice overnight), not a new freezing-drizzle event during bus time. News intel also found no confirmed neighboring-district closures and no community buzz—signals that typically precede conservative closures.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for closures, the best Brier-optimized call is still LOW for a full closure, but not minimal because patchy black ice on rural/secondary bus routes is the realistic pathway to disruption.
