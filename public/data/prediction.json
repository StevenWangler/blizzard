No ice signal during the morning commute window, winds are modest, and any snow is delayed until late evening.\n\n### 1) Temperature + Wind Chill (6–8 AM bus stop window)\n- **Air temps (6–8 AM):** ~**17°F at 6 AM**, **19–20°F by 8 AM**.\n- **Wind (6–8 AM):** **5–6 mph** from the south.\n- **Wind chill / “feels like” (6–8 AM):** about **9–10°F** (not near Michigan closure thresholds of -10°F to -20°F, and **nowhere near** the automatic closure trigger of **≤ -20°F**).\n- **Trend:** temps **slowly rising** through the morning.\n\n**Impact:** Cold, but **not dangerous-closure cold**. Expect typical winter bundling, not a shutdown.\n\n### 2) Precipitation Type + Snow Amount + Timing (timing vs 7:40 AM start)\n- **Overnight through morning (midnight–noon):** **Dry** (0 precip in the hourly data).\n- **Any snow:** A brief **very light snow** signal appears **late evening (~11 PM)**.\n- **Total snow for Thu:** essentially a **trace** (~**0.02 inches**, i.e., ~0.05 cm).\n- **Snow rate peak:** effectively **near zero** (no accumulating snowfall rates shown).\n\n**Plow/road impact:** None for the morning. If a few flakes show up late evening, it’s after school.\n\n### 3) Wind / Blowing & Drifting Snow\n- **Max wind:** ~**13 mph** (highest late morning/midday).\n- This is **below** typical blowing snow concern thresholds (generally needs **15+ mph** with dry, powdery snow and fresh accumulation).\n\n**Impact:** No drifting/blowing snow problem expected.\n\n### 4) Visibility (important nuance)\n- The hourly dataset shows **~1 mile visibility** at times in the early morning (5–9 AM) despite no precip.\n- That pattern is consistent with **low stratus / patchy fog / haze** rather than snow.\n\n**Impact on buses:** Patchy reduced visibility can slow rural driving a bit, but **by itself** (with dry roads) it’s **rarely enough** to close in Michigan.\n\n### 5) Alerts\n- **No active NWS-style alerts** in the provided feed.\n\n## Michigan-style Snow Day Takeaway (Rockford)\n- **Snow/ice during commute:** **No**\n- **Snow amount:** **Trace**\n- **Wind/blowing snow:** **No**\n- **Wind chill closure threshold:** **No** (feels like ~**9–10°F**)\n- **Main “issue”:** possible **low visibility (~1 mi)** early, but likely patchy and not storm-driven.\n\n### Snow day probability (meteorology-only)\n- **Full-day closure:** **~5%**\n- **2-hour delay:** **~10%** (only if visibility is notably worse than forecast in spots)\n\nIf you can share expected road conditions from tonight (Wed evening) or any local observations (fog/black ice reports), I can refine the delay vs. normal start call."

Based on what you provided, I’d center the snow-day (full closure) probability around ~5–8% for Thu 2026-02-05, with the main upside risk being any unmodeled freezing drizzle/black ice on rural routes early Thursday."

      "Have transportation do an early-morning spot check on: bridge decks, low-lying dips, and north-facing roads; if multiple slick reports come in by ~5:45–6:15 AM, consider targeted route holds or a short delay rather than a full closure.",
      "Parking lots/drop-off areas: treat early (salt/sand) before staff arrival; compacted snow/ice at curb lines and crosswalk approaches is the likely slip-and-fall issue, not deep snow.",

The main credible disruption mechanism is localized black ice from earlier-evening light freezing drizzle and/or refreeze on bridges/untreated neighborhoods, plus possible patchy fog/low stratus reducing visibility to ~1–2 miles. That pattern historically produces occasional delays, but full closures are uncommon without a widespread ice event, heavy snow timing during the commute, or extreme wind chills. News intelligence shows no emerging wave of neighboring-district closures and no Rockford announcement, which keeps the probability low. A web-source wind-chill discrepancy exists (stale cached pages vs API), but no credible source in the provided verifier output shows ≤-20°F for Feb 5 bus hours; therefore the automatic extreme-cold rule is not triggered.

The forecast shows essentially no accumulating snow during school travel hours and only trace snow very late evening after school. Winds are moderate and should not create blowing snow. Temperatures/wind chills are uncomfortable but generally below typical closure triggers.\n\nI’m nudging the full snow-day (closure) probability slightly above the rock-bottom floor mainly because the hourly visibility is low early (1–2 miles), which can correlate with fog/low stratus and occasional surprise slick spots. But absent measurable precip/ice during the commute, a closure is still unlikely.\n\nMy meteorology call: **~6% chance of a full snow day**.

I’m nudging slightly above the meteorology-only 5% because: (a) the feed shows **morning visibility around ~1 mile** at times, and (b) safety/infrastructure peers flag **patchy refreeze/black ice** as the realistic failure mode for “surprise” disruptions even when precip totals are negligible.\n\nHowever, absent a strong ice signal or accumulating snow during 5:30–8:00 AM, Rockford-area districts historically tend to stay open (sometimes with heightened caution, rarely with full closure)."

The forecast shows essentially no snow/ice falling during the morning commute window, and winds are not high enough to create blowing snow hazards. The credible safety concern is localized black ice (bridges/untreated neighborhood roads) plus possibly reduced visibility (~1 mile) around 5–9 AM; either could justify a delay if widespread on bus routes, but the meteorological signal for a system-driven hazard is weak. Net: I’m placing full snow-day/closure probability at 9% (higher than meteorology-only 5% to account for black-ice/visibility uncertainty), with the more likely operational adjustment being a targeted delay or route modifications rather than closure."

That strongly suggests we are not in a widespread storm-response pattern where districts preemptively close the night before.\n\nHowever, I won’t drive the probability all the way to near-zero because (a) the safety/infrastructure agents highlight a plausible early-morning black-ice/visibility issue window (5–9 AM), and (b) the WebWeatherVerifier notes a meaningful discrepancy in “feels like”/cold severity across cached sources, which can sometimes correlate with last-minute operational decisions (especially delays rather than full closures). Net: low chance of a full snow day, with a modest tail-risk of a morning delay if conditions are worse than currently signaled and that starts showing up in early AM announcements."
