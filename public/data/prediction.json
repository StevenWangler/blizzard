Winds are modest (generally 9–13 mph) from the NW/WNW, not strong enough for blowing/drifting concerns—especially with no new snow. Visibility is generally good (6 miles) during the morning commute; the only notable visibility issue is late evening (around 10–11 PM) when mist/fog drops vis to ~1 mile, which is after school hours. Net: Roads should be in typical February condition; absent an unmodeled flash-freeze from prior moisture, this forecast strongly supports an ON-TIME OPEN school day.

The only meaningful ‘gotcha’ is the mention of **light freezing rain late Tue (2/10) around 11 PM**—if that verifies as even a thin glaze and roads are untreated in spots, you can see localized slickness at the Wednesday morning commute; that would more often produce a **delay** than a full closure.

That is far above the -20°F automatic closure trigger.\n\nHowever, the required web cross-check (Weather.com, NWS/weather.gov, AccuWeather, local sources) could not be cleanly verified for the specific target date/time with the browsing snapshots returned: Weather.com and Weather Underground snippets appear to reference other days or older crawls, and the NWS digital forecast snippet shown is for a different point/date. Therefore, I cannot honestly claim that ‘the public apps’ for Rockford on the morning of Wed 2026-02-11 match the WeatherAPI hourly wind chills—only that nothing retrieved shows wind chill anywhere near -20°F, and your API forecast is safely above that threshold.",

    "decision_rationale": "There’s a clear conflict between (1) the weather/roads/power fundamentals and (2) the single-source media claim of a closure list that includes Rockford.\n\nOn fundamentals, this does not meet Michigan’s usual closure triggers: no active snow, no meaningful accumulation, no high wind/drifting, and wind chills are in the teens—not in the -15°F to -20°F (or ≤-20°F automatic) bands. Infrastructure expectations also align with an OPEN day: it’s a refreeze/black-ice management night, not a situation where plows can’t keep up. The safety analyst’s own breakdown indicates the hazard is likely *patchy* (bridges, shaded curves, neighborhoods), which typically supports an on-time opening or at most a short delay—unless freezing drizzle verifies as more than trace and is widespread enough to keep even treated main roads slick.\n\nHowever, the news signal cannot be ignored because closings are ultimately administrative decisions. The issue is verification: we have FOX 17 saying Rockford is closed, but the environment couldn’t confirm a second independent, date-correct closings feed, and the district website capture didn’t show a closure notice. Because the corroboration is incomplete and web verification for date-specific pages was inconclusive, I’m not moving to a high (70–90%+) ‘already decided’ probability.\n\nNet: I’m forecasting a low-to-moderate chance of a closure (22%)—mostly to account for the possibility that (a) Tuesday night icing is worse than the WeatherAPI trace suggests *and/or* (b) the FOX 17 closure listing is in fact current and Rockford has already made the call. Absent confirmation of the closure listing, the best Brier-optimized play for Michigan is to stay decisively on the ‘open’ side while acknowledging a non-trivial upset risk from icing/administrative domino effects.",

However, the NEWS agent introduces a strong, history-relevant override: districts typically do not get listed as ‘closed’ on a major outlet’s closings story unless there is an announcement or at least a strong district/ISD feed. That shifts the question from ‘should they close?’ to ‘have they already decided to close?’ Given that signal—and the fact that many nearby districts are reportedly closed—I move to a materially higher probability. I’m not going all the way to 80–95% because the district’s own site (per the NEWS agent) did not clearly corroborate the closure in the captured crawl, so there is non-trivial risk the media list is stale, generalized, or mis-attributed (or the crawl missed an official channel like social media/robocall).",

              "**Ice/black-ice tail risk**: even minimal freezing drizzle/freezing rain late Tue night (shown around ~11 PM Tue 2026-02-10) plus teens/20s temps overnight can yield isolated slick spots; historically this more often produces *delays* than full closures, but it can be the proximate justification when districts preemptively close.",

Patchy ice usually points to a **delay** rather than a full closure—*unless* there is already a credible, broad regional closure signal. Given the NEWS agent’s report that a major local outlet has Rockford listed as closed (and many neighbors closed), I raise the snow-day/closure probability to reflect that operational reality, while keeping confidence moderate because the district website verification was inconclusive and the web weather verification was unreliable for the exact target date.",

In practice, once a district is on a major station’s closings list, the probability of an actual closure is very high, even if the public-facing district site doesn’t prominently show it yet (sites are often updated later, and many districts rely on SMS/social/closings feeds rather than homepage posts). The main reason I’m not at ~95–99% is the lack of direct confirmation from Rockford’s own channels in the captured crawl and the possibility of a list mix-up (wrong Rockford, wrong date, stale post, or auto-generated article).",

As the meteorology specialist, I’m uncomfortable going as high as 80–90% without direct district confirmation because the *meteorological forcing* on Wednesday is weak and the web-weather verification noted date/staleness issues.\n\nSo I split the difference: I materially raise the probability (to reflect the non-meteorological but plausibly weather-triggered decision environment), but keep it below a coin flip because the only weather hazard left is **patchy refreeze/black ice**, which more commonly yields **delays** and spot-treat operations rather than full district-wide closures.",

That combination almost never *forces* a snow day in West Michigan by itself.",
              "**Main met driver for any disruption is *ice potential*, not snow.** The broader forecast package shows a brief light freezing-precip flag late Tue night (around 11 PM Tue 2026-02-10) followed by temps falling into the teens by Wed AM. Even a trace glaze can create scattered slick bridges/secondary roads. This supports a higher *delay* risk than *closure* risk.",

Because I cannot independently verify that list here, I treat it as a major but uncertain modifier rather than a near-certain outcome."

However, the debate’s new information is that a major local outlet reportedly lists Rockford Public Schools as closed for Wed 2026-02-11, and many nearby districts are also listed. From a historical/behavioral perspective, that shifts the question to “did they already announce?”—and the prior probability of closure rises substantially.\n\nI’m not matching the NEWS agent’s 85% because the only official-channel checks presented (district homepage + news archive) were inconclusive, and the web-verification tooling is explicitly unreliable for freshness/date-targeting here. That combination increases the odds of a mis-listing or stale closings article. Netting those together, I land in the middle: more-likely-than-not (55%) but with only moderate confidence (55%).",

              "**But ‘already listed as closed’ is historically powerful:** Districts usually end up on TV-station closings lists because (a) the district/ISD feed pushed a closure, or (b) station staff verified it. Historically, when a district is explicitly listed as “closed,” the base rate of that being true is high—so we should not treat this as a pure meteorology exercise anymore.",
              "**Regional coupling:** The NEWS agent reports multiple nearby/peer districts also closed. Historically, West Michigan closures are often “clustered” by county/metro, even when conditions are only moderately hazardous (patchy ice / refreeze mornings).",
              "**Plausible pre-dawn hazard even without Wed precip:** The Tue 2026-02-10 ~11 PM ‘light freezing rain’ flag + subfreezing overnight supports the common “thin glaze → spotty crashes → conservative calls” pathway. This pattern more often yields delays than full closures, but it can contribute to a closure decision—especially if many neighbors have already pulled the trigger.",
              "**Counterweight:** The district’s own website/news archive crawl did not show a closure post. Historically, that *can* happen (districts post to social/robocall first), but it’s also a classic failure mode for media lists (stale/incorrect entry, wrong ‘Rockford’, wrong day)."

That would put closure probability in the low single digits with a higher *delay* chance.\n\nHowever, the peer NEWS analysis introduces a potentially decisive real-world indicator: Rockford reportedly appears on a FOX 17 closure list for Wednesday, with many nearby districts closed. From a safety/transportation perspective, that kind of regional clustering often corresponds to widespread early-morning slickness, multiple accident reports, or a conservative coordinated response—even if the deterministic forecast looks quiet.\n\nBecause we have only partial corroboration (no obvious district-site post captured; web verification issues), I’m treating the FOX 17 signal as a meaningful but not definitive override. Net: I move upward from my earlier 25% to **35%**—basically ‘more likely open than closed, but not dismissible,’ with the implied expectation that **a delay is more probable than a full closure** if the ice risk verifies.",

              "**The only true safety wildcard is ice**: the Tue 2026-02-10 ~11 PM ‘light freezing rain/freezing drizzle’ flag plus the hard freeze afterward could yield **patchy glaze** on bridges, shaded neighborhood roads, bus loops, and sidewalks—more consistent with a **delay** than a full closure.",

Historically, that kind of regional closure clustering is a strong predictor that the operational decision is already made (or imminent), even when the next-day forecast looks benign.\n\nBecause the evidence shown is not first-party and the web verification is explicitly unreliable for date correctness/freshness, I won’t go as high as 70–85%.

Patchy ice alone usually triggers: spot-salting, slower operations, maybe a delay if early morning assessments find multiple slick-spot incidents.\n\nHowever, peers introduced a strong real-world indicator: a major local outlet’s closings list reportedly includes Rockford and many nearby districts for Wed 2/11/2026. If that listing is correct and current, the safety question becomes moot—the decision is already effectively made. Because we do **not** have first-party confirmation in the captured district site content and the web-verifier flagged freshness/date-targeting issues, I treat the FOX 17 signal as *high-value but not fully confirmed*.

However, the debate’s key historical/operational pattern is that **if** Rockford is already showing as ‘Closed’ on a major local outlet’s closings list (especially with many neighboring districts), the realized closure frequency is usually high because it implies a decision has already been made in response to observed/anticipated icing.

That combination can yield **patchy but severe** slick spots during **6–9 AM**, which is exactly when districts are most risk-averse (buses, new drivers, intersections, and rural connectors).\n\nHowever, patchy ice more often produces a **delay** (or heightened caution + salting) than a full closure—unless there’s evidence of widespread glazing or an operational decision already posted. The NEWS agent’s claim that Rockford is already listed as closed on a major station’s closings list is a big deal; if true and current, it pushes the probability toward “already decided.” Because we lack first-party confirmation and the web verification was inconclusive on date-specific cross-checks, I split the difference and land just under 50%."
