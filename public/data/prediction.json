Temperatures hover around 30–34°F with light winds (generally 4–6 mph early, increasing to ~10–12 mph later). Wind chills stay in the mid-20s—nowhere near the dangerous closure thresholds. The main operational concern is patchy slick spots (bridges/overpasses) and localized low visibility at bus times, but Michigan road crews typically handle this without closing.

Historically in Michigan, a no-snow day at 30–36°F is very unlikely to close schools (~1–5%). The only meaningful pathway to a closure is a freezing-fog-driven combo of near-zero visibility and/or a thin, widespread glaze on untreated surfaces right at bus time. Given the forecast showing freezing fog around midnight–1 AM and again near the pre-dawn window with visibility down to ~1 mile (2 km) around 4–7 AM, I’d calibrate a Rockford-area closure probability around 5–10% (most likely outcome: school is open, possibly with a delay if dense fog thickens). Confidence: medium, because fog impacts are notoriously localized and a small temperature/visibility error can swing decisions."

Weather details (no snow, temps ~30–34F, light wind, wind chills mid-20s) do not meet Michigan closure thresholds; the only meaningful weather concern is localized freezing fog/patchy black ice and reduced visibility around 6–8 AM, which would typically support messaging or possibly a delay *if school were in session*, not a districtwide cancellation.

In a Michigan district with mature winter operations, that combination usually yields (at most) a delay or extra caution rather than a full closure—unless visibility drops well below ~0.25–0.5 mile broadly and/or spotter reports show a *widespread* glaze.

However, peer NEWS analysis indicates Rockford Public Schools is *not in session* on Monday, Feb 16, 2026 due to Mid-Winter Break. That makes a “snow day” (weather-driven cancellation of an instructional day) overwhelmingly unlikely on this specific date.

Those conditions can create real hazards (especially for buses and walkers on untreated surfaces), but the forecast lacks the two big closure drivers: significant snowfall/ice accretion and near-zero visibility over a broad area. With proactive salting, a quick pre-dawn route test, and conservative driving protocols, the residual risk usually translates to ‘open’ or possibly a 1–2 hour delay, not a full cancellation. Therefore I put weather/safety-driven closure probability very low.\n\nNon-weather note: the NEWS agent reports Rockford Public Schools is already scheduled closed for Mid Winter Break on Feb 16, 2026.

The only plausible pathway to a weather-related closure is a freezing-fog-driven combination of (a) a more widespread-than-forecast thin glaze/black ice on untreated roads/bridges and (b) visibility dropping well below what’s shown (i.e., toward dense fog levels). Given the forecast’s minimum visibility near ~1 mile and temperatures hovering right around 32°F (not locked well below freezing), I keep the *weather-driven* snow-day probability very low, but not zero.\n\nI am adjusting slightly downward from my prior 3% to **2%** because the hourly forecast does not show truly hazardous visibility (e.g., <0.25–0.5 mile) and still shows no precip—so the “patchy” nature of impacts is the dominant expectation.\n\nImportant non-meteorology note (from NEWS): if Rockford Public Schools is already closed for Mid-Winter Break on Feb 16, then a “no school” outcome is likely regardless of weather.

However, this specific date (Mon, Feb 16, 2026) appears to be a planned non-instructional day (Mid-Winter Break). Historically, when school is not scheduled, there is effectively no “snow day” decision to be made—so the family-facing probability of “no school” is near-certain. Therefore I align with NEWS/SAFETY and set 99% for ‘no school’ on that date, while noting that the counterfactual weather-only closure probability would remain ~1–2%.",

The one credible disruption pathway is freezing fog producing *localized* black ice and reduced visibility during the 6–8 AM bus window. However, the forecast minimum visibility is about 1 mile rather than near-zero, and there’s no explicit freezing drizzle/precip mechanism shown—so the risk is more consistent with caution messaging or a possible delay than a districtwide cancellation.

The one credible disruption pathway is freezing fog producing *localized* black ice and reduced visibility during the 6–8 AM bus window. However, the forecast minimum visibility is about 1 mile rather than near-zero, and there’s no explicit freezing drizzle/precip mechanism shown—so the risk is more consistent with caution messaging or a possible delay than a districtwide cancellation.

I leave **1%** residual for edge cases (calendar posting error, last-minute board-approved change, or a rare conversion to a make-up day).\n\n**Counterfactual (if it were a normal instructional Monday):** I’d align with meteorology/safety at roughly **1–3%** closure risk, with the only plausible disruption being a *delay* from freezing fog/black ice during the 3–8 AM window, not a full cancellation."
