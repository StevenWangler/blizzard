Temperatures remain below freezing all day (teens in the morning, low 20s°F afternoon), with wind chills mostly in the single digits above 0°F. Winds are from the WNW around 10–13 mph with gusts into the mid-teens, and skies are clear to partly cloudy. Visibility stays excellent (around 6+ miles) and total forecast snowfall/precipitation for the day is 0.0 inches. \n\nThe existing Winter Weather Advisory runs until 7:00 AM Thursday for the *previous* system, which delivered 1–4 inches of snow and some freezing rain on Wednesday. However, by the overnight hours into Thursday, precipitation has ended and conditions are simply cold and breezy with dry roads gradually improving as plows and salt work overnight and into the morning. In a Michigan district accustomed to regular snow and light ice, this kind of post-event cold/cleanup day—without ongoing precipitation, without heavy new accumulation, and with winds under 20 mph—almost never triggers a closure. At most, there could be isolated slick spots or minor delays on untreated secondary roads early, but the weather itself does not support a snow day.\n\nBottom line for Thursday 2026-01-01: very low likelihood of a snow day based on weather alone; schools are overwhelmingly likely to be open under these cold, dry, sunny-to-cloudy conditions."

Historically in this part of Michigan, this pattern almost always leads to school operating on time: the prior day’s advisory-level snow/freezing rain is modest (1–4\"), there is a long overnight window for plows and salt to work, and conditions during normal school hours are simply seasonably cold and partly to mostly sunny. While isolated icy spots and brisk wind chills at bus stops could prompt extra caution, the overall historical analog for West Michigan districts suggests a low closure probability and a strong likelihood of a regular school day under these conditions."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT\n- Meteorology: Event is over by the early overnight hours; Jan 1 is cold, dry, and quiet with 0.0\" additional snow and excellent visibility.\n- Safety: Risk level is LOW; primary and secondary roads scored 8–9/10; only residual slick spots; explicitly states conditions do NOT justify a snow day or delay.\n- History: Very similar past patterns (light snow/ice day before, cold/dry next day) yield closure rates mainly in the 5–15% range; districts typically stay open.\n- News Intelligence (secret weapon): Rockford is **already closed** Jan 1 for scheduled Winter Break, not for weather. No neighboring districts are posting weather closures, and there is no buzz about a storm.\nAll four experts agree there is no compelling weather/safety reason for a closure decision on Jan 1.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR NUANCES\n- There is no true conflict: all point to low operational impact. The only nuance is that the meteorologist notes a residual Winter Weather Advisory (from the prior system) through 7 AM, while safety and history both interpret this as standard, manageable cleanup—not closure-worthy in Michigan.\n- No expert suggests even a delay; at most, caution for cold bus stops and spots of ice.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions end: about 2026-01-01T03:00-05:00.\n- Typical high school start/bus window ~7:00–7:40 AM.\n- That gives roughly 4–4.5 hours from precip/\"worst conditions\" end to first buses, plus the earlier evening hours for plow and salt operations.\n- With only 1–4\" and modest freezing rain, this is ample time for Michigan crews to clear primary routes and school lots, consistent with the safety analyst’s high road scores (8–9/10) and “minimal” commute impact.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Ice formation risk: listed as \"moderate\" but in the context of **no new precip** and temps staying below freezing—so this is mainly patchy refreeze on untreated surfaces, not active glazing.\n- No freezing rain is forecast during the commute, and visibility is excellent.\n- In Michigan, this level of residual, predictable slickness is routinely handled with salt and driver caution and rarely triggers a closure by itself.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel: No evidence that Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or other Kent County districts are issuing **weather-driven** closures for Jan 1; most are on break anyway.\n- Regional closing portals show no wave of pre-announced weather closings tied to this system.\n- Therefore, there is **no neighboring-closure bump** to apply. The scheduled holiday/break nature of closures does not count as a snow/ice signal under the competition rules.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\n- An unexpected, post-midnight band of lake-effect snow or surprise freezing drizzle setting up directly over Rockford and lasting into the 5–8 AM commute window, creating fresh accumulation or glaze not in the current forecast.\n- A significantly colder than forecast wind-chill drop deep past typical thresholds (e.g., sustained -20°F or worse), which could push districts toward a cold-related closure.\n- Major, unforeseen road incidents (pileups, widespread black ice, or power outages knocking out building heat) that force an emergency operational decision independent of the forecast.\nCurrently, none of these higher-impact failure modes are indicated by any expert stream or the news intelligence.\n\n7. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (Brier-score mindset)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly supports low closure probability; dry, stable weather with no new accumulation. This pulls us toward the 5–10% range.\n- Safety (25% weight): Explicitly says conditions do not justify a snow day or delay. Road scores 8–9/10 corroborate this. Also points us near 5–10%.\n- History (20% weight): Analog closure rates 5–15% for this pattern. That sets a historical band and discourages overestimating.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon): Confirms the \"closure\" on Jan 1 is purely calendar-based. No weather chatter, no neighboring emergency signals → pushes probability to the very bottom of Michigan thresholds.\nBlending these, a calibrated estimate is at the **low edge** of the 5–15% Michigan guideline band for <4\" and post-event cleanup. To avoid being artificially indecisive and to minimize Brier error, I set the final probability at **5%** rather than a vague mid-range estimate.\n\n8. FINAL INTERPRETATION\n- Operationally, there is **no true snow day decision** for Rockford on Jan 1, 2026—it is a pre-planned break day.\n- If hypothetically school were scheduled, the combined evidence still supports an overwhelming likelihood of **normal operations**, perhaps with only standard winter cautions.\n- Thus, the correct competitive call is that a weather-driven snow day on this date is **very unlikely**.",
