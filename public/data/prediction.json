Temperatures fall below freezing and stay there, with NW winds 10–13 mph producing morning wind chills around 14–16°F (not near Michigan cold-closure thresholds). The only meaningful travel concern is a brief window of light freezing rain around ~2 AM (trace QPF ~0.01\"), which could create isolated slick spots on untreated bridges/overpasses, but amounts are too small and timing allows road crews several hours before buses. Visibility is generally good (6 mi) with localized late-evening reductions to ~1 mi due to mist/haze. Net: roads should be manageable with typical Michigan treatment; snow-day probability is very low, with only a small risk of a minor delay if icing is observed in the morning."

By itself, that setup usually produces either an on-time open or, if morning spot checks show widespread glazing on secondary roads, a 1–2 hour delay—not a full closure. The main reason the closure probability is higher than the expert-average (~9%) is the news intelligence signal: FOX 17 is actively running a ‘Wednesday closures’ cycle and explicitly lists Rockford Public Schools as closed (and Forest Hills as closed). That is a strong behavioral indicator if it is current and date-correct, but it conflicts with (a) the district website not showing an official notice in retrieved pages and (b) the quiet point forecast. To optimize for real-world decision-making (and Brier score) under this conflict, I’m moving from single-digit closure odds to a low-but-meaningful 22%: still more likely OPEN than CLOSED, but acknowledging (1) a black-ice surprise can push administrators conservative, and (2) if a major TV closings list is already showing Rockford as closed for Wednesday, the operational outcome may already be decided regardless of the light-precip forecast. No extreme cold trigger exists (no source shows ≤ -20°F wind chills during 6–8 AM), and power outages appear too limited/systemwide to force closure.",

With no measurable snowfall accumulation forecast and only a trace, short-duration freezing-rain signal centered near ~2 AM, the pathway to a full closure is limited to *widespread* surprise glazing/black ice that persists into the 6:30–7:30 AM bus window. Given the tiny modeled precip amount and lack of supporting signals for heavier precip/wind/visibility deterioration, a normal ‘open’ outcome is favored. I’d still keep a small non-zero probability because freezing drizzle can be under-forecast and even a thin glaze can disproportionately affect untreated rural connectors, hills, and bridges—more often producing a delay than a full closure."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical/behavioral standpoint (how Michigan districts tend to decide), a **full snow day** on Wed, 2026-02-11 is unlikely because there’s **no accumulating snow** and winds are modest. The forecast’s only “closure-capable” ingredient is a narrow window of **trace freezing rain** (~2 AM) followed by subfreezing temps, which can yield patchy black ice. In similar past setups, districts most often run **on time** or call a **1–2 hour delay** if morning spot checks show widespread slickness. I therefore land at **~9%** for a full closure, with delay risk higher (not requested, but likely in the ~15–25% band)."

That can create patchy black ice (the most safety-relevant hazard here), but patchiness usually leads districts to lean on spot-salting + cautious bus operations rather than a full shutdown—unless morning observations show widespread sliding/poor traction on secondary roads.\n\nI’m therefore placing **~8%** probability on a full snow day (closure) for Wed, 2026-02-11, with a higher—but not asked for—implicit chance of a **minor delay** if icing verifies more broadly than forecast."

However, the lack of an official Rockford Public Schools announcement for Wednesday, Feb 11, 2026, plus the provided forecast showing near-zero precip/snow and only trace overnight icing potential, argues against a full snow day for Rockford specifically. Net: low-but-nontrivial chance driven mostly by the possibility that (a) closures are already spreading across the region for lake-effect bands west of US-131, or (b) trace freezing rain verifies more broadly than modeled and pushes a conservative closure call. I land at 12% for a full closure (with a higher chance of a delay than a closure, though delay probability isn’t requested)."
