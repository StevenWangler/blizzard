Cross-checking what a typical parent might see on Weather.com’s hourly page, Tuesday morning appears even milder (about mid-30s with feels-like mid-20s around 6–8 AM), which is notably warmer than the API by roughly ~6–8°F for the morning feels-like. A regional local-news forecast also supports a warmer Tuesday (mid-30s) but is not Rockford-specific hourly guidance.

The only meaningful hazard is a narrow daybreak window of freezing fog/near-saturation air with temps in the mid/upper 20s, which can create isolated black ice—especially on bridges/ramps and untreated neighborhood routes that buses use. That risk supports monitoring and potentially a targeted/short delay if driver test-loops find widespread glazing, but it does not justify a district-wide closure in typical mid-Feb Michigan readiness absent confirmed widespread icing, crashes, or materially reduced visibility.\n\nNews intelligence reduces the ‘domino effect’ concern for Tuesday: FOX17 currently shows no active closings/delays, and Rockford Public Schools has no Tuesday closure/delay post visible on its website/news archive. Power-grid conditions are also supportive of normal operations (statewide outages very low and decreasing), making an outage-driven closure unlikely.\n\nNet: keep full closure probability low but non-zero (freezing fog can overperform and produce crash clusters).

        "shiftReason": "Meteorologically, Tuesday 2026-02-10 in Rockford, MI looks like an ‘ordinary winter overcast’ day with near-freezing temperatures and essentially zero QPF/snow accumulation during the morning decision window. The only plausible weather-based disruption mechanism is patchy freezing fog/glaze around daybreak (roughly 5–8 AM) given very high humidity and temps in the mid/upper 20s. That favors isolated slick spots and possibly a delay in pockets, but a full snow-day closure typically needs accumulating snow/ice over a broader area, dense fog with materially reduced visibility, or extreme cold/wind chill—none of which is clearly supported here. I therefore keep full-closure probability low, but not zero due to (a) freezing-fog uncertainty and (b) model disagreement on exact temps/feels-like (WeatherAPI vs Weather.com) which affects refreeze/icing risk at daybreak."

Historically, that pattern has a very low full-closure base rate (roughly 1–3%). The only plausible driver for operational disruption is patchy black ice from the brief freezing-fog setup around ~5 AM and near-saturation humidity; that scenario is more consistent with a 2-hour delay than a district-wide closure. Given the absence of accumulation and no alerts, I land at ~3% for a full snow day closure."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Tuesday 2026-02-10 looks overwhelmingly like an “open” day in Rockford, MI. There’s no forecast accumulation and no widespread heavy precip during the school commute window. The only credible school-impacting safety risk is localized icing from freezing fog / near-saturation air between about 5:00–9:00 AM, which can produce isolated black ice on secondary roads and bridge decks (the exact places buses must traverse). That situation can justify targeted delays if it verifies broadly, but it rarely forces a full district closure absent a measurable glaze event—which is not indicated by the very low precip totals and generally good modeled visibility. Net: low closure probability, modest delay probability; I’m assigning a small upward bump above the pure “no snow” baseline because freezing fog is explicitly flagged at a high-risk time."

        "shiftReason": "As the NEWS specialist, I’m weighting decision-signals and pattern behavior more than raw meteorology. The strongest news-side indicator is the FOX17 closings feed showing Rockford and multiple nearby districts already closed on Monday (2/9), implying road/operational impacts were significant enough to trigger coordinated decisions. However, the Tuesday (2/10) forecast provided looks materially quieter: essentially no precipitation during the bus window, only modest winds, and temps hovering around freezing. That combination historically produces **open schools** with occasional **delays** when fog/refreeze is patchy but noteworthy. I therefore keep the **full closure** probability low, but not near-zero because (a) freezing fog/black ice can be under-forecast and (b) districts sometimes remain conservative the day after a region-wide closure if secondary roads stay slick.\n\nNet: I land at **6%** for a snow day (closure). I’d put the “any schedule disruption” (delay/closure) higher, but the prompt asks specifically snow-day probability."
