Snow amounts look modest overall (~1.4 inches for the day), which is usually not enough alone to close schools in Michigan. The bigger concern is a pre-dawn wintry mix: light freezing rain is indicated around 3–4 AM, followed by snow toward/after daybreak (notably around 8 AM and again late morning). Even a thin glaze of ice can be the ‘great equalizer’ for closures/delays, especially if it occurs during the early commute window. Winds are breezy but not extreme (peaks ~14–15 mph), contributing to wind chills near/around single digits in the morning and some blowing/drifting risk is low. Visibility frequently runs 1–3 miles during the morning snow, supporting slower travel. Net: elevated risk for a DELAY due to possible icing and active morning snow; a full snow day is less likely unless freezing rain is more impactful than forecast."

I resolved this by weighting the location-specific point forecast higher for Rockford amounts, while treating the advisory as a “higher-end banding” scenario that could still happen.\n3) Plow timing math: Safety analyst notes worst conditions end ~08:30, which is 50 minutes AFTER the 07:40 bell (i.e., no recovery window before start time). However, Michigan crews can keep main roads passable; the key issue is secondary roads and bus routes.\n4) Ice: Yes—trace to very light glaze (~0.00–0.02\") possible 03:00–04:00. Not a major ice storm, but enough for patchy slick spots.\n5) Neighboring districts: No verified closures/delays found yet; no “3+ neighboring districts closed” bump applied.\n6) What would make me wrong: (a) the advisory verifies at the high end in/near Rockford (band arrives earlier/stronger, yielding 2–4\" by morning), (b) freezing rain is more than a trace and widespread, or (c) early-morning incidents/slide-offs spike on secondary roads.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 35% (points to modest snow + light glaze), Safety 25% (high secondary-road slickness + overlap with commute), History 20% (typical outcome is delay > closure for this pattern), News 20% (advisory messaging increases risk ceiling but lacks confirmed district actions).\n\nResult: A FULL snow day is still unlikely in Rockford given modest expected accumulation by start time and no confirmed neighboring closures; the more probable operational outcome is a 1–2 hour delay.
