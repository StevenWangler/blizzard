Temperatures stay well below freezing (low near -1°F, morning temps rising into the teens), with modest W/WNW winds (up to ~15 mph) creating wind chills near or below 0°F around the morning commute. Snowfall is essentially negligible (trace only, with a small late-night light snow signal near 11 PM), so plowing needs and blowing/drifting snow impacts are minimal. The biggest operational risk is refreezing/black ice from Tuesday’s freezing rain/snow and any untreated pavement/sidewalk moisture, plus cold-related safety concerns at bus stops. Overall snow-day closure probability is low; if any delays occur, it would more likely be from isolated ice/black-ice issues rather than new snow accumulation."

Web verification initially flagged a Weather.com view showing ~-23°F to -24°F, which would strongly push toward closure. Follow-up verification indicates this is likely a page/locale artifact: WeatherAPI + canonical Weather.com + another Weather.com variant cluster around +1°F to +6°F feels-like for 6–8 AM. Therefore, no extreme-cold automatic-closure trigger is supported.\n\n3) Plow timing math: Snow/ice impacts wind down Tue evening, giving ~21 hours to the 6:30 AM bus window. Infrastructure now expects trunklines largely clear and arterials treated by ~06:30, but residential/local streets remain inconsistent. That combination usually supports ‘open’ or a DELAY rather than a full closure.\n\n4) Ice?: Yes—moderate refreeze/black ice risk is the main driver. This pushes probability upward from a pure ‘quiet day’ baseline.\n\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Wed 1/28 closure wave found in the latest accessible scans; this removes a key multiplier that would otherwise add +15–20%.\n\n6) Power outages: Statewide outage count increased (12→187), but Kent County appears near-zero and no Rockford cluster is evident. This is not a closure driver right now.\n\n7) Multi-source wind chill: Best-verified 6–8 AM wind chill is above 0°F and far above the ≤ -20°F threshold.\n\n8) What would make this wrong? If late Tue night observations show widespread glazing/freezing fog on untreated roads (not just isolated spots), or if multiple nearby districts post early-morning closures (domino effect), or if a localized power loss hits key school buildings. Any of those would shift toward a 2-hour delay or, less likely, closure.\n\nNet: With no new snow and no verified extreme wind chill, a full closure remains unlikely, but refreeze + variable neighborhood streets keep it above a ‘routine open’ probability. Final full snow-day (closure) probability: 22%. A 2-hour delay is the more plausible disruption outcome.",

However, the *residual-impact* setup from Tuesday’s freezing rain/snow plus subzero/near-subzero overnight temps does elevate the chance of at least localized hazardous travel early Wednesday—more consistent with a **delay** than a closure.

My estimate centers on residual impacts: if Tuesday evening leaves packed snow/ice on secondary roads and temperatures stay subfreezing, districts sometimes choose a 2-hour delay or (less often) closure.

The only weather-driven pathway to a closure is indirect: residual ice/packed snow from Tuesday plus an overnight refreeze could make some secondary/residential roads hazardous at 5:30–8:30 AM. That scenario more commonly produces targeted delays or heightened caution rather than a full districtwide closure.

Peer input (Safety/Infrastructure) emphasizes a defined 05:30–08:30 refreeze risk window and mediocre local-street conditions, which historically is exactly the scenario where districts sometimes escalate from “open” to “delay,” and occasionally to closure if multiple rural route checks fail.
