The forecast for Monday, 2026-02-23 is a very typical hot/humid day with only trace precipitation and modest winds. That puts the literal snow-day probability at ~0%. If we interpret ‘snow day’ as a general weather-driven closure day, I still keep it very low and non-zero (≈1%) as a hedge for highly localized thunder/downpour impacts or rare operational decisions—but nothing in the quantitative forecast suggests the kind of widespread flooding or severe convection that historically forces closures in Lagos."

The forecast indicates a warm, humid day with only trace-to-very-light precipitation and modest winds—conditions that do not typically justify closing schools. The only meaningful operational risk is localized convection/lightning near the morning window; that can prompt brief outdoor restrictions or a short, localized delay if a storm cell is directly overhead at arrival, but it is unlikely to produce widespread, all-day travel hazards given the very low modeled rainfall totals and lack of flooding signal."

In addition, the peer ‘news’ signals included show no active closings/delays and no district post indicating a closure for Monday, 2026-02-23. Given only patchy/light rain potential and no alerts, the only plausible closure paths would be rare non-weather disruptions (e.g., sudden infrastructure failure, security incident), which I treat as a very small base-rate. Therefore I set a near-zero closure probability (0.5%) for the school day on 2026-02-23."
