    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Monday, December 1 in Rockford, MI, conditions are cold but relatively quiet compared to the weekend storm. Temperatures stay well below freezing (upper teens at the bus hour, upper 20s afternoon), which means anything that melts Sunday will re-freeze, but there is no signal for new significant snow during the school window. From midnight through the morning commute (around 6–9 AM), skies are partly cloudy with mist developing toward and after sunrise, light winds (generally under 8 mph), and visibility mostly 6+ miles except for localized fog/mist pockets down to about 1–2 miles. The only organized snow on Monday’s forecast occurs late in the evening: brief heavy snow bands between about 9–11 PM could drop around a quarter inch of new snow with temporary visibility near 1 mile, but this is after school is out. Total new accumulation for the calendar day is very light (~0.25\"), and there is no ice signature—surface temps remain below freezing all day and the precip that does occur is all snow. Winds are modest and blowing/drifting issues are minimal. Given Michigan’s high tolerance and the likelihood that plow crews can clean up the weekend storm by Sunday night and early Monday, the probability of a snow day or delay specifically because of Monday’s weather is low; any closure risk would be tied to residual poor road conditions from the 7–12\" weekend storm, not from Monday’s new weather, and even that risk is on the lower side if crews perform as usual."

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the forecast for Monday, 2025-12-01 in Rockford, MI, historical patterns strongly favor school being open. The key Michigan closure triggers—active heavy snow during the morning commute, significant ice, blizzard conditions, or extreme cold (wind chills below about -15°F)—are not present in this forecast. Heavy snow and travel impacts are concentrated in the Winter Storm Warning period from Saturday morning through late Sunday morning, giving road crews much of Sunday to clear 7–12\" of accumulation. By Monday, conditions are cold but manageable: temperatures mostly in the upper teens to upper 20s°F, light to moderate winds (generally under 15 mph), and only trace to very light snow during school hours, with heavier snow not appearing until late evening (around 9–10 PM and after). Historically in West Michigan, similar setups—big weekend storms followed by a quieter, seasonably cold weekday—rarely produce snow days, especially when visibility is good and no new significant accumulation is expected during bus times. While there can still be some residual slick spots or narrowed shoulders from the weekend storm, Rockford’s experience and equipment typically handle this without canceling. Overall, the historical analogs suggest a low probability of a snow day on Monday, with the most likely outcome being a normal school day, possibly with reminders to allow extra travel time rather than closures or delays."

    "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON\n- Meteorology: The impactful storm is over by late Sunday; Monday is cold, mostly quiet, with only around 0.25\" new snow and no ice storm.\n- History: In West Michigan, when the storm peaks on the weekend and Monday is quiet, schools almost always open; historical snow-day rates in similar setups are 5–15%.\n- Safety: Primary and secondary roads score 7–8/10, walking and driving conditions 7–8/10; morning and afternoon commute impacts labeled “minimal.”\n- News/Community: No Rockford or neighboring-district signals of concern, no regional talk of Monday closures, and district communications indicate a normal return from Thanksgiving break.\n\nAll four converge on: storm already passed, cleanup time available, conditions Monday are routine winter cold with manageable roads and no broad expectation of closing.\n\n2. WHERE THEY DISAGREE\n- Meteorology notes a prior Winter Storm Warning with 7–12\" snow, acknowledging some residual road recovery may be needed, but still frames Monday risk as low.\n- Safety labels overall risk level as “moderate” due to refreeze/black ice potential, even though their numeric scores (7–8/10) correspond to generally safe conditions.\n- History is on the low side (5–15% closure likelihood) and emphasizes Michigan’s high tolerance for exactly this type of setup.\n- News/Intel shows effectively zero buzz or pre-emptive actions; that often undercuts closure probability further.\n\nThe only slight tension is Safety’s qualitative “moderate” wording versus everyone else’s “low risk,” but their details still support opening.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (SNOW END → 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions: 2025-11-30 00:00–12:00 (midnight–noon Sunday).\n- After midday Sunday, no substantial new accumulation; plenty of daylight hours Sunday for plows to clear 7–12\".\n- From Sunday noon to Monday 7:40 AM: roughly 19–20 hours of cleanup time.\n- During that window: no heavy additional snow, winds light, temps below freezing so accumulation isn’t repeatedly melting/refreezing under fresh snow.\n- This is ample time for Kent County and Rockford operations—accustomed to this magnitude of snow—to get main bus routes and most secondaries in good shape.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Meteorology: Temps stay below freezing, precip type all snow, no mixed-precip/icing signal.\n- Safety: Ice formation risk is “moderate” via refreeze and black ice in spots, not via freezing rain or glaze.\n- This is standard post-storm Michigan black-ice risk, not a widespread ice event. That elevates caution, but not systemwide closure.\n\n5. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS DOING?\n- Local News Intelligence: No announcements of closures or pre-announced delays for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD for Monday, Dec 1.\n- No “all Kent ISD closed” headlines, no weather-alert banners from Rockford Public Schools.\n- Social media sentiment: “no_buzz” about closures; community expectation is that school resumes normally after break.\n\nPer your weighting rules, the lack of neighboring closures and lack of concern is a strong downward pressure on closure probability (no +15–20% bump; if anything, it reinforces the low baseline).\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nMain ways this 8% estimate could be off:\n- Underestimating localized plow/backlog problems: If specific rural bus routes or hills remain poorly cleared or compacted by Monday 5–6 AM, the district could call a delay or closure despite good main roads.\n- Unmodeled ice event: If unexpected mist/fog overnight causes more extensive black ice than forecast, especially on side roads, administrators might err on the side of caution.\n- Forecast bust on timing: If lake-effect bands redevelop earlier than expected (e.g., heavy snow starting before the Monday morning commute instead of late evening), conditions could be worse.\n- Operational constraints: If the district has staffing or mechanical issues with buses or plow fleets after the weekend storm, that could force a decision not strictly tied to weather severity.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (PER DIRECTIVE)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Signals low-impact weather during school hours—no active storm, very light accumulation, light winds. This strongly supports opening. As a standalone, this would suggest roughly a 5–10% closure chance.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road/parking and driving scores of 7–8/10, with only moderate refreeze risk and minimal commute impact. This points to low but non-zero risk, perhaps in the 10–15% range on its own, mainly due to black ice.\n- History (20% weight): Analog patterns give 5–15% snow-day rates; combined with a seasonal adjustment of -0.2 (favoring openness) this pushes toward the low end of that range.\n- News & Community Intelligence (20% weight – “secret weapon”): No district alerts, no neighboring closures, no social-media buzz, and forecasts framed as routine winter weather. In your rules, if neighbors were closing, I’d add +15–20%; here, the opposite—no action and no buzz—justifies staying at or slightly below the historical/mets baseline.\n\nNUMERICAL SYNTHESIS\n- Meteorology: ~8% (quiet Monday, residual snow only).\n- Safety: ~12% (to reflect moderate refreeze risk on some side roads).\n- History: ~10% (within the 5–15% analog band, leaning low given Michigan norms).\n- News/Intel: ~5–8% (community expects school open; this pushes down).\n\nWeighted blend (approximate):\n0.35*8% + 0.25*12% + 0.20*10% + 0.20*7% \n= 2.8% + 3.0% + 2.0% + 1.4% ≈ 9.2%.\nGiven Michigan thresholds (<4\" new snow, no ice storm, no neighboring closures), that aligns with the 5–15% band reserved for routine events.\n\nTo stay decisive and avoid an unnecessary 40–60% range, I round this to an 8% snow-day probability: explicitly low, but not zero, mainly to acknowledge possible localized refreeze or incomplete cleanup on some rural routes.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- Category vs. Michigan thresholds: <4\" new snow and no active storm → 5–15% range. Conditions clearly fall there.\n- Adjustments: No ice storm, no blizzard, no neighboring closures, strong community signal of normal operations → keep near the lower end.\n\nTherefore, final prediction for Rockford, MI on Monday, December 1: \n- Snow day probability: 8% (high confidence that school is open on a normal schedule).",
