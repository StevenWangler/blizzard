Roads overnight stay dry with overcast skies and occasional mist but no measurable precip before late afternoon. The main precip arrives after the core school day: moderate to heavy rain and some light sleet mix start around 3–5 PM, with surface temps in the mid–upper 30s, so this is primarily a wet-pavement event rather than an accumulating winter storm. Winds are breezy (10–17 mph with gusts into the mid 20s mph), giving wind chills in the mid 20s but not at dangerous levels. Visibility holds around 6 miles—no dense fog or whiteout concerns. There is no accumulating snow, no freezing rain signal, no ice storm setup, and no significant precipitation during the morning commute; plows are not needed, and typical Michigan winter driving conditions apply. Based on this forecast, the probability of a school closure or full snow day for Tuesday is very low; conditions support a normal school day with wet, chilly weather, and perhaps a sloppy after-school pickup but not hazardous enough for widespread cancellations."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the forecast for Tuesday, 2026-01-13, this pattern aligns with a typical wet January day in West Michigan—overcast, temps right around freezing at bus time (-0.4 to -0.1°C / ~31–32°F), then into the mid-30s, with about a quarter-inch of liquid precipitation mainly as rain and some light sleet late afternoon and evening. Winds gust in the 20–30 mph range, but stay well below blizzard criteria, and there is no accumulating snow and no extreme cold (wind chills remain in the 20s°F). Historically, Rockford-area and broader Michigan districts rarely close for this combination: no heavy snow, no measurable snow accumulation, no advisory-level freezing rain, no whiteout, and no dangerous wind chill. On days like this, schools almost always remain open, with only routine caution for wet/slick spots. Therefore, the historical analogs and local norms suggest a very low likelihood of a snow day or weather-related closure for Tuesday, with high confidence that conditions will be manageable for normal school operations."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement check:\n- Meteorology: No snow, no freezing rain, temps 31–33°F in the morning rising into mid–upper 30s, main precip (rain with some light sleet) after 3 PM, no winter alerts. Explicitly calls the snow-day probability \"very low\" and supports a normal school day.\n- History: Very close analogs (rainy/mixed but above-freezing January days) show 1–3% historical snow-day rates. Notes that closures in this season almost always require 6–10\"+ snow, blizzard conditions, notable ice, or wind chills below about -15°F to -20°F—none of which apply.\n- Safety: Morning commute impact is minimal; worst travel is 3–7 PM with moderate rain/sleet but still manageable. Road scores (primary 8/10, secondary 7/10, parking lots 7/10) and driving/walking scores around 7/10 point to safe operation with standard caution. Recommendation: proceed with normal school operations; no snow day or delay indicated.\n- News/Community: Rockford lists a normal school day; no weather-related alerts. Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) show no closures announced. Media and social channels show \"no buzz\" about a storm or possible closure.\nAll four point strongly toward a normal school day and very low closure likelihood.\n\n2. Conflicts and clarifications:\n- The only slight tension is the safety analyst flagging \"moderate\" ice-formation risk vs the meteorologist emphasizing primarily wet roads and no freezing rain signal. This is easily reconciled: at ~31°F with high humidity and mist, localized slick spots on untreated side streets, bridges, or low spots are possible, but the absence of active precip at bus time and a rising temperature profile keeps this from being a district-wide hazard. There is no contradiction, just a conservative safety note.\n- No other substantive conflicts exist among experts.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Snowfall: 0\" forecast; no accumulating snow overnight or in the morning.\n- Morning bus window: roughly 6:00–8:00 AM is dry or just misty, no measurable snow. Since there is nothing to plow, plow/salt operations are either not needed or only minimally needed for potential minor slick spots. The main rain/sleet arrives 3–5 PM, well after the start of school.\n- Hours from precip end to 7:40 AM: Not applicable because the impactful precip is AFTER school starts, not before. From midnight to 7:40 AM there is essentially no plow-triggering event.\nThis strongly favors normal operations.\n\n4. Ice assessment:\n- Meteorology: No freezing rain or ice storm setup; temps near/just above freezing; main precip is rain, possibly mixed with sleet late day.\n- Safety: Describes ice-formation risk as \"moderate\" but in context clearly means localized slick patches where untreated and near freezing, not systemic glaze ice. They still rate roads and driving conditions 7–8/10 and support full operations.\n- History: Notes that closure-driving ice events typically involve advisory- or warning-level freezing rain, flash-freeze setups, or temps dropping sharply—none are present.\nConclusion: There is no significant, widespread ice threat; just normal Michigan winter slick-spot risk.\n\n5. Neighboring districts and community signals:\n- News intel explicitly reports no public closure announcements from nearby districts and no Rockford-specific alerts. Social media sentiment is \"no_buzz\"—not even early speculation about a snow day.\n- Michigan thresholds in the prompt emphasize neighboring closures as a major upward adjustment, but here there are zero such closures and zero buzz, which supports keeping the probability at the low end.\n\n6. Quantitative synthesis and weighting:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong signal for routine, wet, non-snow event with safe temperatures and timing. Supports about a 3–5% closure probability.\n- Safety (25%): Acceptable road and travel scores with explicit recommendation for normal operations. Suggests something like 5–10% at most, largely to cover unforeseen overnight temperature dips or surprise icing.\n- History (20%): Analog days show 1–3% closure. Even allowing for some model and human decision variability, it is hard to justify more than ~5% from this angle.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no chatter, no alerts—community expectation is clearly that school will be open. This aligns with the 3–5% band.\nCombining these: (Meteorology ~4% * 0.35) + (Safety ~7% * 0.25) + (History ~3% * 0.20) + (News ~4% * 0.20) ≈ 4.7%. Rounded and framed within Michigan closure norms, I set the final probability at 5%.\n\n7. Michigan-specific thresholds and why 5% fits:\n- Total snow: 0\" (even below the <4\" = 5–15% category). By the provided thresholds, this strongly favors the bottom of the range.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no wind chill emergency, no NWS warnings.\n- No neighboring districts closing and no community alarm; per instructions, we would only bump probabilities up if those signals were present—they are not.\nGiven all that, 5% is realistic and slightly conservative, while respecting that surprise issues can very occasionally occur.\n\n8. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- An unforecast shift to colder temps (e.g., air and road temps dropping into the mid–20s°F at or just before the morning commute) producing black ice or a brief freezing rain episode.\n- A last-minute change in storm timing that pulls heavier precip (especially any freezing rain) into the pre-dawn hours, overwhelming treatment on secondary roads.\n- A local incident (major multi-vehicle crash, power outage affecting multiple schools, or unexpected infrastructure issue) prompting closure for reasons unrelated to the core weather forecast.\n- Administrative caution exceeding typical norms—for example, if the district becomes unusually risk-averse due to recent incidents and cancels despite the manageable conditions.\nGiven the data at the analysis timestamp, these are low-likelihood edge cases, which is why the final probability remains at 5% with high confidence.",
