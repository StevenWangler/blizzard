Temperatures stay well below freezing all day (roughly 12–16°F), so any existing snowpack/ice will not melt; however, there is no new accumulation expected to trigger a typical Michigan snow day. Winds are modest (NW/WNW 10–15 mph with higher gusts), mainly adding cold wind chills near/under 0°F during the school commute rather than causing blowing snow. The only commute-relevant flag is a brief visibility dip to around 1 mile near 4–5 AM (likely low cloud/fog/haze), but with no falling snow and light winds at that time, widespread hazardous travel is unlikely. Overall snow-day risk for Monday is very low; the bigger concern would be localized slick spots from residual/packed snow and extreme cold effects (bus reliability, exposed skin), not a storm."

The main realistic disruption risk is localized slick spots from refreeze/patchy early-morning reduced visibility, which more often leads to slower travel or minor delays than a full closure.

Main hazards are patchy black ice and a brief early visibility dip.\n2) Disagreement: Only major conflict was the web verifier’s earlier apparent ≤-20°F feels-like trigger from Weather.com. Fresh verifier follow-up indicates those Weather.com values were tied to earlier dates (stale/cached) and are not credible evidence for Mon 1/26 6–9 AM. With that resolved, the consensus remains low closure odds.\n3) Plow timing math: With no new snowfall, there’s no ‘snow end → plow buffer’ constraint. Infrastructure indicates priority routes likely in best shape by ~05:30–06:30; residential loops may still have packed/icy patches at 06:30.\n4) Any ice? Yes—moderate risk of patchy black ice/refreeze on untreated/shaded surfaces and bridge decks, but not a widespread glaze event.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no confirmed Monday closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts at this time.\n6) Power: Power-grid check shows very low systemwide outages and no verified Rockford-specific facility outages.\n7) Wind chill trigger: Not confirmed for Monday; most likely near 0°F during bus hours.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) a surprise episode of freezing fog/ice fog producing widespread glaze, (b) an unforecast burst of light snow/lake-effect reducing traction/visibility, (c) a localized but significant Rockford-area power outage impacting school buildings.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% + Web verification 5% → strongly against closure (dry, modest winds; cold but not threshold). Safety 20% + Infrastructure 10% → supports only a small tail risk (patchy ice on residential routes). News 15% → no closure signals to bump up. History 15% → analogs suggest ~3–6% closure; adjusted slightly upward due to residual ice/visibility window. Power 10% → no outage-driven override.

That combination rarely produces a full snow day by itself. The credible meteorological pathways to closure would be (a) unexpectedly widespread dense fog/ice fog reducing visibility much more than forecast during the bus window, or (b) a colder-than-forecast wind chill regime reaching district thresholds, but the provided hourly keeps visibility impacts brief and wind chills generally near 0°F, not -15°F to -20°F. So I’m keeping the snow-day probability low, with a non-zero tail risk for a delay if untreated roads + patchy fog create a notable early-morning travel hazard."

        "shiftReason": "As the HISTORY specialist, I’m weighting this as a classic low-probability closure setup: no new snow, no freezing rain signal, and winds that aren’t strong enough for drifting/whiteouts. The best historical analogs (“cold, dry post-outbreak” and “recovery day”) produce relatively few full snow days, with outcomes more commonly being normal operations or at most a targeted delay if untreated secondary roads ice up overnight. I land at **6%** to reflect that there *is* a non-zero chance of a local operational decision (especially if residual ice is worse than forecast), but history strongly favors open schools on a day like Mon 2026-01-26."

That usually produces cautions (slower routes, spot-treatment, possibly a delay if crews observe widespread black ice), not a full district-wide closure. I’m keeping the snow-day probability non-zero (12%) mainly because (a) the forecast shows a brief low-visibility window around 4–6 AM when black ice risk is highest, and (b) the region is coming off exceptional cold, which can leave packed/icy neighborhoods that don’t improve by morning. Still, with no forecast snow/ice and only modest winds, a full snow day is more unlikely than likely."

That combination usually means school proceeds, even after a disruptive cold/snow week. I’m not at “near-zero,” though, because (a) the region has had multiple closures recently and (b) extreme cold can leave behind widespread packed snow/black ice on lower-volume roads, which can drive a conservative call if Sunday night refreeze is severe. Net: low chance of a full snow day, modest chance of a delay.\n\nI’m keeping the probability above 10% specifically because of the verifier’s highlighted discrepancy: if a reputable, up-to-date local forecast on Sunday night shows wind chills closer to -15°F to -25°F during bus-stop hours or unexpected light snow/lake-effect, districts may pivot late."
