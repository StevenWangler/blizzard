Overnight and the 6–8 AM bus window stay above freezing (temps ~35°F; wind chills ~30°F), with no snow indicated and no precip during the morning commute. The main weather issue is clouds and high humidity with patchy fog possible mid-morning; rain holds off until late afternoon/evening (light rain near 5 PM, steadier rain possible later at night). Winds are modest (generally under 15 mph), so no blowing snow or whiteout risk. With Michigan’s winter operations, expected road conditions at bus time should be wet-to-dry and manageable. Snow-day/closure probability: very low (~1–5%). Watch-outs: localized fog could briefly reduce visibility after 8–10 AM and wet roads late day for after-school activities, but neither is a typical full-day closure trigger in this district."

The only plausible ‘gotcha’ is a brief pre-dawn dip to ~32°F causing isolated black ice on bridges plus fog reducing visibility; that scenario more often yields a delay than a closure.

      "Because meaningful precipitation is not expected during the 5:30–8:00 AM bus route window (rain holds off until late afternoon/evening), MDOT/county crews should be in a normal posture; any early slick spots should be isolated rather than widespread.",
      "Have building/grounds crews monitor and salt school lots, sidewalks, and drop-off loops early (around 5:30–6:30 AM). With wet conditions expected later, prioritize drainage points and known 'glaze' spots (curbs, ramps, and low areas).",
      "If evening activities run late, plan for wet roads and a higher chance of slick patches after sunset as temps hover in the low 40s to upper 30s with rain/showers—advise slower speeds in parking lots and on untreated neighborhood roads."

Weather.com’s hourly for Rockford, MI shows ~35°F at 8 AM with 'Feels Like' ~29°F, closely matching your API hourlies (7–8 AM feels-like ~30°F). No credible source checked indicates wind chills anywhere near the -20°F automatic-closure threshold. Snowfall is consistently shown as 0\"; precip appears to be rain/fog/light rain later rather than snow/ice in the morning commute window. The only notable issue is that web search can surface Rockford, IL content; those should be excluded for a Michigan school decision.",

History supports that thaw/overcast/fog mornings with rain later rarely produce full closures in Rockford/Kent County, and are more likely to be normal operations (at most a minor delay) unless there is confirmed freezing rain or widespread icing—neither is present in the provided forecast. The main conflict was the FOX17/Kent County Road Commission ‘anticipated icy roads’ messaging versus the hourly forecast; after clarifying, safety/infrastructure interpret the realistic mechanism as isolated microclimate refreeze (bridge decks, shaded rural segments) and visibility reduction from fog, not widespread glaze. News intelligence did not find Rockford or neighboring districts announcing closures/delays, removing the key domino-effect driver. Power outages are scattered at the system level and weather is not conducive to new outage growth; absent evidence of a Rockford-specific outage pocket affecting school buildings, power does not materially raise the closure odds. Net: closure is unlikely; recommend OPEN with monitoring and early-morning spot-salt/visibility messaging. Probability set slightly above the 4–6% meteorology/news baseline to account for the non-zero chance of localized black ice or an unexpected freezing-drizzle micro-event prompting a conservative call.",

          "desc": "ESFGRR\n\nSteady melting of snow and ice over the last week has begun to cause\nrivers to rise across the area. Several chances for rain this week\nwill add to these rises. Based on current expected rainfall, no\nsignificant flooding is expected on West Michigan rivers, though\ntypical spring water level rises within the river channels will\nhappen.\n\nMeanwhile, river ice has weakened significantly over the last week,\nand as water levels rise any remaining ice will likely be broken and\nstart to move downstream. This creates the possibility for formation\nof a few ice jams. Ice jams tend to form in the same places\nrepeatedly, so special attention should be paid in the Comstock Park\n(Kent County) area as well as the Robinson Township (Ottawa County)\narea along the Grand River.\n\nAnyone living or working near West Michigan rivers should pay extra\nattention this week as water levels rise. Have a plan to monitor and\nrespond if flooding develops unexpectedly.\n\nMonitor the latest conditions at https://water.noaa.gov\n",
