    "decision_rationale": "All four core experts (meteorology/history/safety/news) converged on a very low closure probability (~3–5%) because Monday’s forecast is dry with light winds and non-extreme cold. The only meaningful hazard signal is *not* snowfall—it’s the combination of high humidity/possible low stratus or fog indications plus subfreezing temperatures that could create isolated black ice on bridges, shaded rural segments, and slick school lots/sidewalks. Historically and operationally in West Michigan, that setup most often results in normal operations (sometimes with cautions or spot treatment) and occasionally a *delay* if early route checks confirm widespread glaze; it rarely produces a full district-wide closure.\n\nConflicts resolved: (1) Safety’s ‘moderate’ ice-formation risk is now anchored to a plausible mechanism (freezing fog/frost deposition and residual moisture), and the safety analyst indicated it should downgrade to low–moderate if pavement is confirmed dry Sunday night. (2) Web verification does **not** show any ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours; while web sources were somewhat stale/mixed, *none* indicate extreme cold. Therefore no automatic cold-closure rule is triggered.\n\nSecond-order/community effects: News intel found no credible wave of weather-driven neighboring closures/delays for Mon 2/9; the only confirmed neighboring operational change is Sparta’s scheduled delayed opening for teacher in-service, which should not pressure Rockford to close. Infrastructure operations (MDOT/KCRC typical playbook) support pre-dawn patrol/spot-treating on bridges and known slick locations, which usually keeps primary routes serviceable.\n\nPower: the newest outage snapshot increased (still not a major event). With quiet weather (no precip, light wind) the main risk is a *localized lingering outage* affecting a building’s ability to heat by morning, not storm-driven new outages. That is a low-probability but real ‘wildcard,’ which is why the probability is not ~3% and is set at 6%.",

I’m assigning a small non-zero probability mainly for a “patchy black ice + fog” morning where conditions are worse than forecast on rural routes—this tends to trigger delays more often than full closures. Net: snow-day (closure) probability stays in the low single digits."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/transport standpoint, Monday 2026-02-09 looks like a standard cold winter day for Rockford, MI: no new snow/ice load, manageable winds, and temperatures/wind chills that typically do not force closures. The only plausible operational disruptor is localized slick spots (black ice) during the pre-dawn bus window plus potential patchy fog reducing sight distance at rural stops/intersections. Those hazards are usually mitigated with spot-salting, slower bus operations, and targeted cautions; they rarely justify a district-wide snow day unless they become widespread and verified by early route checks."

None of those are present here. The provided WeatherAPI forecast for Mon 2026-02-09 is dry with manageable cold and winds; that strongly suppresses both operational need and the kind of pre-closure messaging districts push out the day prior. Given the residual tail risk of patchy black ice/fog (and the visibility data artifacts noted by other agents), I won’t go to near-zero, but the most likely outcome is normal operations."
