Winds are breezy early (NW/WNW ~13–17 mph, gusts ~20–26 mph overnight), reinforcing dangerous wind chills and potential frostbite risk. Visibility is generally listed ~6 miles, but several overnight/late-day hours report 0–1 mile/near-zero visibility and a mention of freezing fog late evening, which could create localized slick spots and poor visibility—especially on untreated roads/bridges after Thursday’s snow/ice. Snow-day potential from snow accumulation alone is low for Friday, but a delayed start/cancellation becomes more plausible if the district uses wind-chill thresholds or if freezing fog/leftover ice produces hazardous morning travel."

In Michigan—especially in West Michigan—schools rarely close just for cold unless wind chills meet district thresholds for multiple hours during the AM bus window, or cold coincides with widespread icy/low-visibility travel. Given: (1) no new snow, (2) winds not blizzard-level, but (3) very dangerous wind chills and some fog/visibility flags plus prior-day mixed precip, the overall closure probability looks low-to-moderate, with a meaningful chance of a delayed start or selective cancellations if wind chills verify near -25°F and/or freezing fog/black ice impacts the morning commute.

That is typically enough for priority routes, but not a guarantee for neighborhoods/bridges in extreme cold.\n4) Ice: No new freezing rain expected Friday, but refreeze/black ice risk is meaningful (this is the main travel hazard).\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Friday closures/delays posted yet in captured checks (so no +15–20% bump).\n6) What would make me wrong: If wind chills verify closer to -20 to -25°F for multiple hours at pickup time (district threshold trigger), or if black ice is widespread on secondary roads, or if fog/visibility collapses near dawn despite the point forecast.\n\nWeighting (per system): Meteorology 30% (dry, cold; commute wind chills around -12 to -15°F; fog not strongly supported at 6–9 AM), Safety 20% (high refreeze/black ice on secondary roads; main roads likely OK), History 15% (dry-but-brutal cold usually yields delays/partial impacts more than full closures), News 15% (no Friday closure announcements found yet; earlier-week closures provide only a modest nudge). Remaining 20% (infrastructure/power grid folded into safety/news): no confirmed outage spike.\n\nMichigan threshold application: This is not a snowfall-total day (0\" forecast), so baseline would be low (≈5–15%). I raise it into the mid-20s because (1) refreeze/black ice risk after prior mixed precip in arctic air, and (2) cold-exposure operational pressure for bus riders.

With 0 precip forecast, I expect road conditions to be mostly manageable on main routes, keeping the baseline closure probability relatively low. However, the Cold Weather Advisory (wind chills ~-20°F to -25°F during the morning) elevates student exposure risk at bus stops and increases the chance of a district choosing a delay or cancellation, especially if they have a formal wind-chill threshold policy. The other meaningful safety trigger is the forecast’s repeated near-zero visibility signals (possible fog/low stratus/artifact); if real and coincident with 6–9 AM, it could tip the district toward closure. Net: modest but non-trivial snow-day probability, driven by cold + visibility/spot-ice uncertainty rather than snowfall.",

              "Residual *spot-ice* risk from Thursday’s light freezing rain/snow + rapid refreeze: bridges/overpasses, shaded neighborhood streets, and parking lots could stay slick even with no new snowfall.",
