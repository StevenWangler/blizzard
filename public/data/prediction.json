Overall confidence: medium, with the biggest uncertainty being how much untreated moisture remains to refreeze and how low the wind chills get at 6–8 AM."

Also agreement that a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) DISAGREEMENT: News sources suggested snow might linger into Friday regionally, but the meteorological dataset/hours show 0% precip and good 6–9 AM visibility; I weight the explicit hourly forecast higher. Visibility “0 mi” readings look confined to overnight/late evening rather than commute time.\n3) Plow timing math: If Thu operations wrap ~19:00, there are ~12h40m until a 07:40 start (and ~11h until ~06:00 first pickups). Even if final spot-treat starts ~23:00, there are ~8h40m to 07:40 (~7h to 06:00). Best window is ~03:30–05:30 for fresh treatment. This supports manageability absent new snow.\n4) ANY ice? Yes, but likely patchy not widespread: moderate refreeze risk (bridges, shaded secondaries, lots). Salt is less effective in single digits, so abrasives/targeting matter; this raises delay odds more than full-closure odds.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed weather-related closures/delays for Rockford or listed neighbors at time checked; one neighboring closure (Northview) was for a non-weather reason, so no +15–20% “wave” adjustment.\n6) What would make me WRONG? (a) Wind chills verify closer to -20°F to -25°F at 6–8 AM (policy-trigger territory), (b) refreeze proves widespread on bus routes (not patchy), or (c) an unmodeled lake-effect band/visibility crash develops pre-dawn.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per system weights):\n- Meteorology (30%): cold advisory but 6–9 AM wind chill ~-12 to -15 and no snow; lowers closure probability.\n- Safety (20% incl. infra/power): moderate patchy ice + extreme cold exposure; supports some chance of delay/closure.\n- History (15%): cold-only closures are uncommon unless thresholds met; antecedent refreeze can drive “sneaky delay.”\n- News intel (15%): no confirmed closure wave; reduces odds.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds and lack of snow/ice storm signals, I set full snow-day/closure probability at 23% (leaning ‘open, possible delay’ rather than ‘closed’).",

A sharp temperature drop into single digits/subzero increases the chance of residual moisture refreezing on bridges, shaded roads, and untreated subdivision/rural segments—more likely to cause *isolated* hazards and perhaps a delay than a full closure.",
              "**Visibility anomalies are a wildcard:** The hourly feed reports several near-zero visibility values overnight/early morning despite no precip, and “freezing fog” appears late evening. If dense fog/freezing fog were to coincide with the bus window (roughly 6–8 AM), that would materially increase closure/delay odds. Right now, it’s not clearly centered on the commute window.",
