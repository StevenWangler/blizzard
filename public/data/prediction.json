Temperatures stay below freezing overnight in the low 20s°F, then slowly rise into the low–mid 30s°F by mid to late afternoon. Winds increase through the day, with sustained speeds near 10–15 mph and gusts up to around 30 mph from the SSW–SW, producing wind chills in the teens during the morning. Critically for snow-day purposes, there is no forecast precipitation: hourly data show 0.00\" precip and 0.0 cm snow all day, with the model’s own snow and rain probabilities at 0%. Roads will be dry, with no new snow or ice expected after Monday’s light freezing rain. Visibility is generally good (around 4–6 miles on average) with overcast skies early transitioning to some sun and clear skies later; the 0-mile visibility values in a few pre-dawn hours are likely a data artifact, since cloud cover is high but no fog/precip is indicated. No weather alerts are in effect. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather and the lack of accumulating snow or ice on Tuesday itself, the probability of a school closure or delay for Tuesday 12/16 is effectively near 0%; this looks like a standard cold, breezy winter school day rather than a snow day setup."

Michigan schools, including Rockford, rarely close for cold alone unless wind chills drop to around -15°F or lower, which is not the case here. Likewise, there is no forecast of accumulating snow (let alone the 8–10+ inches with bad timing that often drives closures), no blizzard conditions, and no ongoing significant ice storm on the target morning. Historically, days like this have an extremely low closure rate, on the order of 0–2%. The only modest concern is residual slickness from the previous day’s light freezing rain (Dec 15), but because that precipitation is light, scattered, and ends before the target date—with treatment time available overnight—past patterns suggest roads are usually in acceptable condition by the next morning. Overall, the historical context strongly supports a very low probability of a snow/ice day for Rockford on Tuesday, December 16, 2025."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist (35% weight): Clearly indicates a quiet, dry, cold day: 0% precip, 0\" new snow, no active storm, no advisories. Summary explicitly calls the snow-day probability for this date \"effectively near 0%.\"\n- Historian (20% weight): Historical analogs for this pattern (cold, dry, treated roads, no storm, wind chills not near -15°F) show 0–2% closure rates. Strongly supports school being open.\n- Safety analyst (25% weight): Road and travel scores (9–9.5/10 for roads/lots, 8.5–9/10 for walking/driving) and a \"low\" risk level indicate normal winter operations with only routine caution.\n- News & community intel (20% weight): No posted closures/delays for Rockford or nearby districts; no strong social/media signal calling for closure; messaging is about generic winter caution, not a specific hazard on this morning.\nAll four experts agree: conditions are typical winter cold, with no active storm, and do not meet local closure criteria. There are no meaningful conflicts.\n\n2. Where do they disagree?\nThere is only a minor nuance: the safety assessment flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk in concept, but still rates actual road/lot conditions very highly and describes impacts as minimal. This is consistent with residual, spotty slickness—not systemic, closure-level ice. No expert suggests more than a very low closure chance.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow/ice end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Active light freezing rain/ice was on the prior day (Dec 15), not overnight into Dec 16.\n- For Dec 16 itself, the meteorological analysis shows no new precip overnight or in the morning; that effectively means the \"event\" ended well over 8–12 hours before the bus window.\n- By the 6:00–8:00 AM commute, road crews have had the entire overnight period to salt and treat any leftover slick spots.\n- Safety analyst still recommends only routine pre-treatment of bridges/known black-ice areas and notes minimal commute impact.\nEffective plow/treatment window before 7:40 AM: easily >8 hours, which in Kent County with robust operations is ample for a light event.\n\n4. Ice assessment (does ice change everything here?)\n- Ice is the one factor that can radically raise closure odds, but here:\n  • Meteorology: No freezing rain or new precip expected overnight; temperatures remain below freezing but dry.\n  • Safety: Ice-formation risk is flagged as a theoretical concern due to cold temps and prior light freezing rain, but actual scores and narrative imply isolated slick patches only.\n  • History: Similar setups (light prior icing, then dry/cold next morning) almost never lead to closures; main/bus routes are typically in good shape.\n  • News intel: No widespread crash clusters, no power issues, no special local advisories for hazardous ice on the specific morning.\nConclusion: Some residual or refreeze patches are possible, but not at a scale or severity that historically drives closures in this district.\n\n5. Neighboring district behavior\n- News intel explicitly confirms: no closures/delays posted for Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD for this date.\n- With 0 neighboring closures, there is no \"domino\" push toward closing. Per your rule, the +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring districts being closed does not apply.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\nKey ways this 2% estimate could be off:\n- Hidden ice problem: If residual freezing rain from Dec 15 produced more extensive black ice than reported, and early-morning crash reports or bus test runs find hills and backroads unsafe, the district could call a late closure or delay even without new precip.\n- Unforecast issue: A last-minute, localized freezing drizzle or dense fog/black ice event that the models miss.\n- Non-weather factors: A local infrastructure failure (e.g., water main break at a key campus, heating failures) could close schools for reasons unrelated to the forecast—outside the scope of a weather-based probability.\nHistorically and from current intel, these are low-probability edge cases.\n\n7. Weighting and final probability\nUsing the specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%): Near-0% closure suggested → contributes ~1% after rounding for residual uncertainty.\n- Safety (25%): \"Low\" risk, minimal commute impact, high condition scores → suggests ~1–3% closure risk; we use ~2%.\n- History (20%): 0–2% closure in analogs → ~1–2%.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures in Rockford or neighbors, no strong closure chatter → supports the low historical/forecast rate (~1–2%).\nAll four converge strongly in the 0–3% band. Michigan thresholds say: with effectively 0\" new snow and no active ice storm, baseline closure odds are ~5–15% in generic guidance—but that range assumes active nuisance weather. Here there is *no* active event, so actual odds should be at the bottom tail of that, consistent with the expert data and local tolerance.\nTo minimize Brier score and reflect the strong consensus, I set the probability at 2%, firmly outside the 40–60% \"uncertain\" band and in line with the historical 0–2% closure rate for this pattern.\n\nConclusion: Conditions match a standard cold, breezy Michigan school day with dry roads and routine winter caution. A snow day or delay for Rockford Public Schools on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025 is very unlikely.",
