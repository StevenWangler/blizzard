The main operational concern is *ice/visibility*: a brief light freezing-rain signal near midnight plus freezing fog later at night with near-zero visibility values appearing in the hourly data could create slick spots and localized whiteout-type fog for early-morning travel. Winds are only modest (max ~14 mph), so widespread blowing/drifting is unlikely Wednesday. In a Michigan context, the lack of accumulating snow points to a low snow-day risk; however, if freezing fog/freezing drizzle verifies near daybreak and roads glaze, that ‘ice is the great equalizer’ factor could push some districts toward delays. Net: low probability of a full snow day, but a non-trivial risk of a delay due to patchy ice and localized poor visibility."

Your WeatherAPI forecast shows temps near 2–14°F with worst hourly wind chill/feels-like around -6.9°F overnight and about -6.4°F near 8 AM, then improving toward about -1°F to 0°F during afternoon. Cross-checking what the public may see: Weather.com hourly excerpts for Rockford show cold conditions with feels-like values generally around ~-11°F (and in one excerpt down to about -24°C ≈ -11°F). None of the successfully retrieved sources showed a 'feels like' below -20°F for 2026-01-28. However, key confirmations (NWS point forecast/wind chill, AccuWeather RealFeel, and local TV weather pages) were not successfully captured here, so confidence is limited.\n\nSnow-day signal for Wed 1/28 based on the provided API: minimal new snow (near 0\"), but very cold morning wind chills (single digits below zero) plus any lingering slick roads from Tuesday's advisory snow could impact travel. This looks more like a 'cold day with possible slow commute' than a classic snow day, unless local districts have wind-chill closure policies near/under ~-15°F or road conditions deteriorate overnight.",

    "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis (all 7 inputs, weighted per directive):\n1) Agreement: All experts converge that Wednesday is mostly a clean-up day with near-zero new snow. The main risk is secondary—patchy ice/hard-pack on local roads plus some visibility pockets. No expert supports extreme wind-chill shutdown thresholds.\n2) Disagreements: The only real tension was whether the midnight glaze/visibility issues would persist into the 6:30–8:30 AM bus window. Safety + infrastructure clarified it is primarily a post-event risk (patchy slick spots that can persist because temps stay near 0–10°F), not ongoing widespread precip/whiteout at bus time.\n3) Plow timing math: Impacts mainly Tue; ~17 hours until 6:30 AM Wed. Infrastructure expects trunklines/arterials passable by 6:30 AM, but neighborhood streets may still be hard-packed/snow-covered. That leans away from full closure and toward “open or delay.”\n4) Ice: Yes—there is a non-zero ice signal (brief freezing rain/drizzle around 00:00–02:00). However QPF is tiny and both safety + infrastructure expect patchy (not widespread) glazing, which typically drives delays more than full closures.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed weather-driven wave of K-12 closures for Wed in the Rockford cluster from accessible sources. One nearby closure (Cedar Springs) is confirmed but due to boil-water advisory, so it should not be treated as a weather domino.\n6) Power: Statewide outages remain extremely low/stable; no cluster evidence. No power-based override.\n7) Wind chill verification: Web verifier found no sources suggesting ≤ -15°F to -20°F for Wed morning; likely around -6 to -10°F. So no cold-threshold bump.\n8) What would make this wrong: If the midnight freezing precip is more than a trace and/or freezing fog becomes widespread near daybreak, producing broad glazing on secondary roads across the district, Rockford could pivot to a 2-hour delay or (less likely) closure despite low snowfall.\n\nWeighting: Meteorology (25%) keeps baseline low due to 0\" snow; Safety (25%) bumps risk due to persistent hard-pack/patchy glaze on local roads; News (15%) provides strong “Tuesday was rough” context but lacks Wed closure confirmations; Infrastructure (10%) supports ‘passable mains, weak locals’ which is more delay than closure; History (15%) supports low closure frequency in this pattern; Power (5%) no boost; Web verifier (5%) confirms no extreme wind chill.

Even tiny QPF can matter at 2–6°F because it can create a thin glaze that treatment struggles to erase. Still, these hazards are typically patchy; patchiness tends to produce delays rather than district-wide full closures.\n\nGiven peers: I’m nudging up from my prior 12% to 18% to reflect Safety/Infrastructure concerns about cold-limited road treatment and leftover packed snow, while still keeping the *full snow-day* probability below 20% because Wed’s storm signal is weak.",

Those factors can “punch above their QPF weight,” but they are more consistent with a **delay** than a district-wide closure.\n\nBottom line: meteorology supports *open or delay* as the most likely outcomes; a full closure would require overnight verification of widespread glazing/visibility issues that the current forecast does not strongly imply."

However, I’m staying below the meteorology/safety cluster (~18–22%) because the *target-day* forecast lacks the two historical drivers most associated with full closures: **significant new accumulation during commute hours** or **widespread, substantial icing**.

The forecast reads like a cleanup day with minimal new snow, but it is *dangerously cold* and contains a small freezing-precip window overnight plus indications of very low visibility at times. That combination can create patchy but consequential black ice on secondary/residential roads and at intersections. In Michigan, patchy ice + lingering packed snow more often yields a DELAY than a full closure—unless morning observations show widespread glazing across bus routes. Balancing those, I’m slightly higher than the meteorology/news estimates, because safety decisions are often dictated by the worst 10% of roads (neighborhood pickups), not the average condition."

Combined with a Wednesday forecast that is very cold but largely dry, the most likely public-outcome is “open” or a “1–2 hour delay” if spot-ice/visibility verifies on bus routes.
