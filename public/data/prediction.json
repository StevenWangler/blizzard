The only realistic school-impact hazard is reduced visibility and wet roads during bus time due to steady light rain and possible fog/low clouds; icing risk looks low because temperatures stay above freezing during the commute window.

The most relevant Weather.com hourly page snapshot available in this session shows early-morning temps in the low/mid-30s with feels-like values roughly mid-20s to around 30°F, consistent with WeatherAPI in terms of *no extreme cold*. No web source found indicates wind chill ≤ -20°F during the commute window. The bigger operational risk indicated by the WeatherAPI data is rain/fog and wet roads (plus earlier NWS Special Weather Statement for dense fog on Tue 2026-02-17 morning), not dangerous wind chills or snow accumulation.",

That combination almost never produces a full closure in West Michigan because roads remain generally passable and there is no plowing/accumulation problem. The only credible operational risks are (1) reduced visibility from fog/low stratus in the 6–9 AM window and (2) isolated slick spots on bridges/untreated surfaces if pavement temperatures lag air temperatures near dawn. However, the infrastructure view indicates roads are already clear (monitor/spot-treat mode), the power-grid view shows no evidence of a significant outage event, and the news intel check found no active closings/delays on a major local list and no Rockford PS disruption messaging—removing the ‘domino effect’ pressure. \n\nThere is a mild internal tension: Safety labels ice-formation risk as “moderate,” but did not provide confirming evidence of subfreezing pavement temperatures; given the air-temperature forecast (upper 30s to low 40s during 6–9 AM) and steady rain, widespread ice is unlikely. I therefore weight the ice risk as a low-probability tail, keeping closure probability low but non-zero.
