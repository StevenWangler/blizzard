Winds increase into the 10–15 mph range with gusts up to ~25 mph, giving wind chills in the upper 20s. Visibility fluctuates: near-zero in spots overnight and early morning, improving mostly to 6–10 miles by the main school commute window, though pockets of dense fog may linger.\n\nFrom a Michigan school-operations standpoint:\n- **No accumulating snow or ice is expected on Tuesday itself.** Roads should not be deteriorating from fresh winter precipitation.\n- Any residual slick spots from Monday’s earlier advisory will have had an extra day to be treated and improved.\n- Temperatures remain near/just above freezing during the day, favoring gradual improvement rather than new icing.\n- The main hazard is **patchy dense/freezing fog**, which can locally reduce visibility, especially very early (pre-dawn) but is not typically enough on its own to cancel school in West Michigan unless combined with active snow/ice or more extreme conditions.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather and the lack of new snow/ice on Tuesday, the **probability of a full snow day for Rockford Public Schools on Tuesday 2026-01-06 is very low (on the order of 5–10%)**. A brief fog-related delay is possible if localized visibility is extremely poor right at bus time, but a closure due to these conditions alone is unlikely."

Schools in this part of Michigan are accustomed to operating in light snow, patchy ice, and low‑visibility conditions, and true closure events typically coincide with heavier snow bands, broader winter storms, or dangerous cold snaps.",

      ],
      "infrastructure_considerations": [
        "West Michigan road crews and school transportation departments are very experienced with marginal ice and light glaze events; they typically pretreat key routes when an advisory is in effect and continue treatment overnight if needed.",
        "Rockford Public Schools rarely cancel solely for patchy ice or fog. Historical closures more often align with: (1) widespread ice storms creating tree/line damage and impassable local roads, (2) heavy lake‑effect or synoptic snow with 8–10+ inches and poor timing, or (3) arctic outbreaks with wind chills below about -15°F."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford sits on slightly higher terrain north of Grand Rapids, which can cool a degree or two relative to downtown GR at night. This can allow some local rime ice on trees and lesser‑traveled hills, but with forecast temps staying around 30–32°F and no active freezing rain, that elevation effect alone is unlikely to create system‑wide hazards."

    "confidence_assessment": "Given the provided forecast for Tuesday, 2026-01-06, the risk of a snow day in Rockford driven by these conditions is very low. Key closure triggers in this region—heavy new snow, significant ice accretion, or extreme cold—are absent. Temperatures hover near 31–34°F, winds peak around 15 mph, and there is essentially zero new precipitation (snow_cm = 0, precip_mm = 0) during the overnight and morning commute window. The main hazard is freezing fog and lingering slick spots from the prior advisory area to the north and west, but advisory products for that event expire on Monday morning, a full day before the target school day. Historically, similar freezing‑fog / patchy‑ice setups in early January near Rockford almost always result in school operating on time, sometimes with cautions to drivers but without delay or closure. From a pattern‑analogy standpoint, this forecast looks like a typical marginal‑nuisance day rather than a closure day. Overall confidence that schools will be open on Tuesday is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. WHAT DO ALL FOUR EXPERTS AGREE ON?\n- Meteorologist: No new accumulating snow or ice for Rockford on Tuesday; main issue is freezing fog with localized slick spots and reduced visibility early.\n- Historian: Similar setups (freezing fog, patchy ice, no new precip) almost never produce snow days here (1–5% historically); closures in this region usually require heavy snow, real ice storms, or severe cold.\n- Safety analyst: Primary and secondary roads 7–8/10; morning commute impact \"moderate\" but clearly manageable with normal Michigan winter precautions; no justification for a full snow day.\n- News/community intel: No advance closure signals, no neighboring district closures, and local outlooks explicitly place the higher closure risk north and east of Grand Rapids, not in Rockford.\n\n⇒ Consensus: This is a marginal-nuisance, not a storm day. Schools almost certainly open, perhaps with extra caution.\n\n2. WHERE DO THEY DISAGREE?\n- The only mild tension is tone:\n  - Meteorology and history lean to VERY LOW closure odds (around 5%).\n  - Safety calls risk level \"moderate\" due to freezing fog/patchy black ice for the early commute, but still explicitly says conditions do not justify a snow day.\n  - News intel reports \"uncertain\" community sentiment, but not an expectation of closure.\n- Substantively, none of them argue for closure or even a likely delay; they differ only in how strongly they phrase the low risk.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW/ICE END TO 7:40 AM)\n- Meteorology: No new snow or freezing rain into Tuesday; earlier mixed-precip/advisory event is focused on late Sunday into Monday and expires Monday morning.\n- By the target day (Tuesday 2026-01-06), plows and salt crews have:\n  - The rest of Monday daytime + Monday night to clean up any residual issues.\n  - That’s well over 18–24 hours between the end of meaningful precip and the Tuesday 7:40 AM bell.\n- During that interval, temperatures hover near freezing with traffic and salt working, which favors gradual improvement, not worsening.\n⇒ Plow/salt timing is strongly favorable for having roads in decent shape by Tuesday morning.\n\n4. IS THERE ANY ICE? (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- There was some light glaze / mixed precip risk VERY EARLY Monday (previous day), especially north of Rockford.\n- For Tuesday itself:\n  - No active freezing rain, no accumulating snow, no Tuesday advisory.\n  - Ice risk is from **residual moisture + freezing fog**:\n    - Thin, patchy black ice on untreated side streets, bridges, parking lots.\n    - Rime on exposed surfaces (trees, railings, steps).\n- Safety assessment labels ice formation risk as \"moderate\" but still expects mostly wet-to-slick surfaces, not system-wide dangerous glaze.\n- Critically: there is **no true ice storm, no new heavy icing event, and no indication of widespread impassable roads.**\n⇒ Ice is present as a localized hazard, but nowhere near the threshold that usually drives Michigan closures.\n\n5. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS DOING?\n- News intel:\n  - No confirmed neighboring district closures or pre-announced delays for Tuesday.\n  - TV closing lists have not posted Tuesday-specific widespread closures.\n  - Local school-closing outlook sites emphasize higher risk well north of Grand Rapids; Rockford/Kent County is on the southern edge of impacts.\n- The explicit rule: 3+ neighboring districts closed → +15–20% probability. Right now it’s 0.\n⇒ No positive adjustment from neighboring districts; if anything, the lack of buzz reinforces a low-closure baseline.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE ME WRONG?\nMain ways this forecast could bust HIGHER (i.e., surprise closure or delay):\n- The freezing fog becomes much denser and more persistent than modeled:\n  - If visibility stays near-zero across a wide area right at bus time (6–8 AM) instead of improving, some districts might call a 2-hour delay purely for safety.\n- Temperatures verify 1–2°F colder than expected:\n  - That could turn more of the damp pavement into black ice, making secondary and rural roads much worse than anticipated.\n- An un-forecast light freezing drizzle or lake-effect band sets up over Rockford overnight:\n  - Even a few hundredths of ice accretion could sharply increase crash risk and prompt late calls.\n\nWays I could bust LOWER (i.e., overestimating risk):\n- Fog is patchy, not dense, and visibility is mostly >1–2 miles by 6–7 AM.\n- Road treatment is especially effective Monday night, leaving most routes just wet.\n- Community and media end up treating this simply as a routine January morning.\n\nGiven all that, the most credible failure mode is **a short fog/ice-related delay**, not a full-day closure.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates no new precip, marginal temps, and improving visibility by commute. This alone argues for a very low closure probability (~5–10%).\n- Safety (25%): Rates conditions as manageable with moderate risk and explicitly says they do not justify a snow day; this supports the same low range but highlights a small chance of a delay if conditions locally worsen.\n- History (20%): Historical analogs show 1–5% closure rate for similar setups. This pulls the forecast slightly **downward** from any instinctive overreaction to the word \"ice\".\n- News Intelligence (20%): The \"secret weapon\" shows no neighboring closures, no strong social expectation of a snow day, and professional outlooks downplaying risk for Rockford. That reinforces the **low end** of any plausible range.\n\nNUMERICAL DECISION:\n- Michigan thresholds emphasize that without 4\"+ of snow or major ice, probabilities should stay low. Here we have **0\" new snow and no active ice storm.**\n- Meteorology and history center around ~5%. Safety, accounting for fog/patchy ice, arguably nudges that up a hair (to maybe 7–10%) for the chance of a surprise delay/closure if conditions overperform.\n- News intelligence does **not** provide any upward adjustment triggers (no neighboring closures, no strong closure sentiment).\n\nBalancing all four, I set the **full snow-day probability at 7%** (schools closed all day), with high confidence that school will be open and at most a small chance of a short delay if freezing fog is worse than modeled.\n\nThis stays clear of the 40–60% \"mushy middle\" and should score well on Brier accuracy against the Rockford stats students if the day proceeds as the consensus forecast suggests.",
