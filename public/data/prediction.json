In Michigan, that combination can justify slower bus operations or a minor delay if fog becomes dense/widespread, but it rarely supports a districtwide closure without measurable ice accumulation or an active precip event. \n\nAdjustment from Round 1: I’m nudging from 2% to 3% mainly to acknowledge the near-freezing, near-saturated profile and the explicit “freezing fog” hours—i.e., a small tail risk that visibility drops below what the hourly snapshot suggests (dense fog) and/or patchy ice becomes more widespread than forecast."

None of those are in the forecast. Freezing fog is the only signal that can bite, but in this region it usually produces localized slick spots and reduced visibility—more consistent with heightened caution or a short delay than a closure.\n\nIf we accept the NEWS agent’s calendar finding (Mid-Winter Break), then the *actual* probability of a “snow day closure” is effectively **0%**, because there is no scheduled school to cancel; my 1% reflects the hypothetical “if school were in session” framing used by the meteorology agent."

That said, the forecast does not indicate dense fog (<0.25 mi) or any ice storm/precip, and winds/temps trend toward improvement after sunrise—so a full closure is still unlikely. I’m therefore moving from my prior 40% down to **8%** for a *weather-driven full closure if this were a normal instructional day*, with a higher implied chance of a **delay/slow-bus operations** than a cancellation.\n\nImportant real-world modifier from NEWS: if Rockford Public Schools is already closed for **Mid-Winter Break on Monday 2026-02-16**, then the practical “snow day” probability is effectively **0** because there’s no school day to cancel.
