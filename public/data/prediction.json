Morning wind chills bottom out around ~10°F (6 AM) — nowhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds (≤ -20°F). Roads should be dry with no new snow/ice, and winds are light-to-moderate (peaking ~12–13 mph). The only minor operational issue is reduced visibility from mist around/after sunrise (notably ~8 AM with ~1 mile visibility), but that’s typically manageable with normal caution.

Any leftover moisture from prior days (shaded intersections, bridge decks/overpasses, low-lying areas) could support patches of black ice.",
      "Have transportation staff and first bus drivers do a quick ‘canary’ check of known cold spots (bridges on major corridors, shaded curves, rural gravel segments) between ~5:45–6:30 AM; if they report glazing, spot-salt those locations rather than district-wide changes.",
      "Remind parents/staff: allow extra following distance for the first hour after sunrise; use low beams in mist and watch for pedestrians at crossings where visibility is reduced.",
      "Prioritize clearing/salting: bus loop areas, building entrances, and parent drop-off zones—refreeze is unlikely after mid-morning with temps climbing into the 30s/40s, but early-morning packed snow/ice in lots can still be slick.",
      "No extreme cold trigger: wind chills are generally around +10 to +15°F near the bus pickup window—cold but not in the -20°F automatic-closure range.",
      "Snow-day implication (Michigan-calibrated): this is an ‘open’ day. In most states, the morning mist + cold might raise more concern; in Michigan, with no active precip and warming temps, this typically stays operational unless there’s unexpected pre-existing ice."

The main weather nuisance is shallow morning mist/fog around 8–9 AM with visibility near ~1 mile, plus a plausible but localized black-ice risk on bridges/overpasses and shaded backroads if residual moisture exists. In Michigan (and specifically West Michigan), that combination almost never produces a district-wide weather closure; it’s typically handled via spot-salting and cautious driving. The only meaningful ‘conflict’ is the safety assessment labeling ice formation risk as “moderate” despite zero precip; reconciled as: ice risk is not district-wide, but localized/spotty where untreated moisture lingers. \n\nSeparately, local news intelligence indicates Rockford Public Schools are already scheduled CLOSED for Mid-Winter Break on Fri Feb 13, 2026—so the practical outcome is “no school,” but that is calendar-driven, not a weather ‘snow day.’ My probability above is for a weather-driven snow day/closure decision (if the district were otherwise operating).",
