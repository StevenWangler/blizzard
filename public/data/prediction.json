Snow amounts are negligible (~0.04\"), so this is not a classic Michigan snow-accumulation closure setup. The bigger concern is ice: the daily forecast calls for light freezing rain, and with temperatures solidly below freezing all day, any freezing drizzle/freezing rain would stick immediately and create slick roads/sidewalks—especially bridges, overpasses, and untreated neighborhood streets. Winds are light (max ~9 mph), so blowing snow is not an issue. Visibility is mostly okay once daytime starts, but the overnight hours show extremely low reported visibility (0 miles) which could indicate patchy fog/ice crystals or a data artifact; if it’s real, it could briefly worsen the early-morning commute. Overall: LOW snow-day probability from snow, but a MODERATE risk of delays/closures if freezing rain actually occurs near the pre-dawn to morning commute window (roughly 5–9 AM) and surfaces become glazed before treatment."

If glazing is widespread and coincides with the bus/parent drop-off window, closure/delay odds rise despite the tiny precip totals."

However, Weather.com’s hourly forecast for Rockford shows a colder overnight/morning period with multiple hours below -20°F (roughly -22°F to -27°F from about 2–8 AM). Regional reporting tied to NWS Grand Rapids also suggests wind chills could dip to around -25°F in parts of West Michigan Thu night into Fri morning, supporting the possibility that Rockford sees sub -20°F wind chills. Snow/ice amounts in the WeatherAPI day forecast are minimal (near 0.01\" precip and ~0.04\" snow equivalent), so cold wind chill is the dominant closure risk, not snowfall depth.",

Power outage risk is not currently a driver.\n2) Disagreement: The key conflict is wind chill severity during the bus window. WeatherAPI suggests bus-window wind chills mostly above the automatic threshold (>-20°F), while Weather.com shows multiple hours ≤ -20°F (roughly -25°F). Web verifier flags this as a major discrepancy and cannot confirm ≤ -20°F across TWO independent hourly sources.\n3) Plow timing math: Precip/icing risk is mainly Thu evening to ~midnight, giving ~6+ hours to 06:30 for treatment. Infrastructure expects main routes mostly drivable by 06:30, but secondary/local bus-route segments remain variable due to extreme cold reducing salt effectiveness. This supports ‘delay more likely than closure’ framing.\n4) Ice: Yes—patchy glaze/black ice is plausible; that elevates risk even with no snow.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 1/30 closures/delays located in checks; therefore no +15–20% boost.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages very low (17 customers affected reported); no evidence of widespread heating/power failure risk.\n7) Wind chill verification: Threshold risk is plausible (Weather.com ≤ -20°F), but not corroborated by a second hourly source; hence not a near-automatic closure call.\n8) What would make this wrong: If NWS/Kent County messaging and multiple sources verify sustained ≤ -20°F wind chills at 06:00–08:00, closure odds jump sharply. Conversely, if wind chills are closer to -10°F to -15°F and icing is minimal, odds drop and school likely opens (possibly with a delay).\n\nFinal calibration: Baseline for ‘no snow, but patchy ice + very cold’ is low-to-low-moderate. I’m setting 30% for a full closure because (i) a credible source indicates wind chills below the -20°F threshold at bus time and (ii) black ice risk on secondary roads is non-trivial in extreme cold. Lack of confirmed neighboring closures, low outage risk, and likely-passable main roads keep it from rising above ~35–40%.",

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 418 PM EST, an ice jam continues to be reported by local\nauthorities on the Muskegon river in southern Newaygo County.\nThe river gauge at Newaygo shows water levels remaining at\nminor flood stage as of Wednesday afternoon.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
