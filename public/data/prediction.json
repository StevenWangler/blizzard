With no snow/ice falling Monday morning and visibility near 6 miles, Michigan road crews should have no new accumulation to fight during the commute. The only meaningful risk is residual slick spots from Sunday's light snow/freezing rain refreezing overnight (lows near 18°F), especially on bridges, side streets, and untreated rural roads. Net: a normal winter operating day for West Michigan—very low snow-day likelihood (roughly 5–10%), with a slightly higher chance of minor delays only if Sunday’s event leaves behind patchy ice that doesn’t get fully treated."

Therefore I cannot credibly validate a -20°F wind chill risk from the public-facing apps/pages using this dataset.

The safety/infrastructure inputs do flag a real 6–9 AM refreeze window—mainly on secondary/local roads and micro-sites (bridges, shaded areas)—but that pattern historically produces at most a 1–2 hour delay more often than a full cancellation. News intelligence adds an important tie-breaker: FOX 17’s live closings aggregator showed no active closings/delays at the time checked, and there’s no sign of neighboring-district closures that would pressure Rockford into a domino cancellation. Power-outage risk also looks low given the extremely small systemwide outage count. The biggest remaining uncertainty is the *actual* Sunday evening road moisture/icing extent (not fully confirmed by live MiDrive/KCRC snapshots in the accessible data); if it over-performed, a delay becomes more plausible—but that still doesn’t make a full snow day likely.",

The credible closure pathway is widespread black ice on secondary roads and bus turnarounds (plus slick parking lots/walkways) after Sunday’s light snow/freezing rain and an overnight refreeze into the teens.
