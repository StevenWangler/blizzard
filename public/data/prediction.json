It will be snowing essentially the entire school window, with periods of moderate to heavy lake-effect snow overnight through at least mid-morning. Hourly snow rates are on the order of 0.1\"/hr, but bands can locally spike higher, and the NWS Winter Storm Warning calls for 4–7\" total accumulation over the event, with travel hazards explicitly expected for both the Monday morning and evening commutes. Winds of 10–16 mph (gusts to around 30–35 mph per the warning) from the W–WNW will cause areas of blowing and drifting snow and very poor visibility in open/rough rural stretches. Visibility repeatedly drops to around 1 mile or less in heavier bursts during the pre-dawn and early-morning hours, which coincides with bus and student travel times. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for snow, the relatively modest single-day totals by themselves might not guarantee closure, but the combination of: (1) an active Winter Storm Warning over Kent County through Tuesday morning, (2) continuous overnight and morning snow, (3) subzero wind chills risk, and (4) NWS explicitly flagging hazardous conditions for the Monday morning commute substantially raise the disruption risk. Overall, this setup strongly favors at least widespread delays and has a meaningful chance of full closure, especially if heavier lake-effect bands set up over key bus routes during the 5–9 AM window."

School is usually in session through many days with light to moderate accumulating snow and single‑digit wind chills; widespread closures historically correlate with either: (1) intense lake‑effect squalls producing rapid 4+ inch bursts right during the commute and whiteout conditions, or (2) arctic outbreaks sending wind chills to around -20°F or lower across the early morning bus window.",

        "Because this is a Sunday‑night‑into‑Monday event, road crews and districts typically treat it as a ‘high alert’ scenario with early assessments around 4–5 AM; historically this timing yields either a full closure or a normal start rather than a delay, depending on how intense bands remain just before and during the 6–8 AM bus window."

      "elevation_impact": "Local elevation changes are modest but enough that areas on slightly higher ground west/northwest of Rockford often see enhanced lake‑effect accumulation and blowing/drifting compared to lower, more sheltered parts of the district."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, this looks like a classic West Michigan lake‑effect warning event with continuous snow showers, occasional heavy bursts, gusts into the mid‑20s mph, and wind chills hovering a bit below 0°F, but without true blizzard‑level winds or life‑threatening cold. Historically, Rockford and similar nearby districts do sometimes close on days like this—especially when an NWS Winter Storm Warning is in effect specifically highlighting commute impacts—but they also remain open for many comparable events, given strong local snow‑removal capability and the cultural norm of operating through most winter weather. Comparing to similar past patterns, the conditional probability of a snow day for Monday, 2026‑01‑19 is moderate rather than high: the combination of (1) an active Winter Storm Warning listing the Monday AM and PM commutes, (2) ongoing overnight and morning snow with brief heavy bands and reduced visibility around the 6–9 AM window, and (3) sub‑zero wind chills at times, all argue for elevated closure potential. On the other hand, estimated storm totals of roughly 4–7 inches spread across the full event, winds generally under 35 mph locally, and wind chills mostly in the -5°F to -10°F range keep this below the more clear‑cut closure thresholds of crippling blizzard conditions or extreme cold below about -15°F wind chill. Overall, this setup most closely matches prior days with a meaningful but far‑from‑certain chance of cancellation—roughly in the 30–50% band—highly sensitive to how intense and persistent the heaviest snow bands remain over Rockford itself between roughly 4 AM and 8 AM on Monday."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST:\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist, historian, and safety analyst all agree that Monday 1/19 will feature hazardous winter conditions in Rockford: ongoing lake‑effect snow under a Winter Storm Warning, snow‑covered/slippery roads, reduced visibility, and sub‑zero or near‑zero wind chills at times, especially during the morning commute window.\n- All three agree that travel impacts are significant enough that on a *normal* school day, there would be a meaningful chance of a weather‑related closure or at least strong consideration of one.\n- News intelligence agrees that this hazardous weather is occurring over a date already identified as non‑instructional.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- There is no real conflict on the *weather itself* or its impacts; the small differences are about degree (historian suggests roughly 30–50% historical snow‑day likelihood in similar setups; safety calls risk ‘high’ and strongly suggests considering closure; meteorology frames it as a meaningful but not guaranteed closure setup).\n- The apparent conflict is conceptual: meteorology/history/safety are evaluating, in abstract, whether conditions are ‘snow‑day caliber,’ while the news intelligence states that Rockford Public Schools is already officially CLOSED to students for MLK Day and PD, explicitly as a planned calendar closure, not a snow day.\n\n3. What’s the plow timing math? (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Per the meteorological and safety timelines, snow does **not** cleanly end before the morning; instead, snow continues through the overnight and into/through the morning commute, with the ‘worst conditions’ window from roughly 12:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and specifically severe impacts around 4:00–8:00 AM.\n- That means there is effectively **zero clear plow window** before a hypothetical start of school; crews would be plowing *while* snow continues and visibility varies. For an actual school day this would substantially raise closure/delay probability.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Air temps 7–16°F with wind chills near/below 0°F strongly favor **snow‑ and ice‑covered pavement**.\n- The safety analyst explicitly flags **high ice formation risk**, due to very cold pavement and reduced salt effectiveness, leading to persistent packed snow/ice on roads and in parking lots.\n- So yes, icy conditions are expected, even though the falling precip is snow, not freezing rain. From a road‑safety standpoint this is functionally similar to an ice‑impact scenario.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intelligence shows **no neighboring district closures** reported specifically as weather‑driven for this date, and no regional pattern of emergency snow closures beyond the standard MLK Day observance where applicable.\n- With 0 confirmed neighboring districts closing explicitly *for weather*, there is **no +15–20% probability bump** from regional behavior.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Two main ways:\n  a) If Rockford’s calendar or official communication were misinterpreted and, contrary to the intel, **students were actually scheduled for a normal instructional day** on Jan 19. In that case, using only the weather, history, and safety analyses, a snow day probability in the ~40–60% band could be defensible due to the Winter Storm Warning, ice risk, and bad timing.\n  b) If the district decided to *relabel* the day as an official weather closure for reporting/accounting purposes, even though no students were going to attend anyway. That would be an administrative classification issue, not the usual ‘will kids have school or a snow day?’ decision.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates a solid, travel‑impacting lake‑effect event under a Winter Storm Warning, continuous snow into the commute, and significant visibility and wind‑chill issues. On a normal school day this alone would push toward a moderate snow‑day probability (roughly mid‑range in Michigan terms for a 4–7\" event spread over 24–36 hours).\n- Safety (25% weight): Gives a ‘high’ risk rating, with severe morning commute impacts, high ice formation risk, and explicit advice that districts should strongly consider closure or a delay. Purely on safety grounds, this tilts the probability upward vs. climatology.\n- History (20% weight): For similar patterns, historical snow‑day rates range from 15% to 40%, with the most analogous cases falling around **30–40%**; the historian characterizes this as a ‘moderate rather than high’ conditional probability, emphasizing that West Michigan often stays open in such storms.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, but decisive contextually): Conclusively reports that **Rockford Public Schools are already scheduled to be closed to students for MLK Day and staff PD** on Jan 19, and that this is communicated clearly in multiple official sources. There is no chatter or evidence of a contemplated *additional* weather‑related closure.\n\nSYNTHESIS:\n- If this were a regular instructional Monday with students expected:\n  - Meteorology (35%) + Safety (25%) would support a notably elevated snow‑day probability, perhaps on the order of **45–55%**, with Michigan’s higher thresholds and historical data keeping it below the 60%+ ‘likely closure’ regime.\n- However, the **core question** here is ‘What is the probability of a *snow day* (weather‑caused student cancellation) on 1/19?’ not ‘Is school in session?’ or ‘Are conditions dangerous?’\n- The News Intelligence—our ‘secret weapon’—shows that **students already have the day off for non‑weather reasons**, and all current communication frames it as a standard holiday/PD day. There is no indication the district will reclassify it as a snow day.\n\nGiven that:\n- The baseline probability of a *weather‑driven* cancellation, conditional on already being closed for a holiday, is extremely low.\n- Even very severe weather would not meaningfully increase the odds that the district retroactively or symbolically calls it a ‘snow day’ instead of ‘holiday/PD day’—there is no incentive or pattern supporting that.\n- Neighboring districts are not signaling a special, region‑wide emergency closure beyond normal MLK observances.\n\nTherefore, the **operational snow‑day probability for students** is effectively near zero. To avoid an overconfident 0 that could be wrong if the district did something unusual administratively, I assign:\n\n- **Final snow day probability: 5%**\n- **Confidence: high** (because district documentation and news intel are clear, and only an atypical administrative choice would overturn this).\n\nThis balances:\n- 35% meteorology + 25% safety + 20% history → would suggest ~45–55% if it were a normal school day.\n- 20% news intel + calendar reality → collapses the practical snow‑day probability to near zero because school is not scheduled in the first place.\n\nOn the Michigan threshold scale (<4\", 4–6\", etc.), this event’s **4–7\" over 24–36 hours with lake‑effect** would normally support something in the 35–50% range for a snow day given the timing and ice, but the **pre‑planned MLK closure dominates the decision**, forcing the final probability down regardless of weather severity.\n",
