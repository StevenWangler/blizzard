The main potential operational issue is visibility: several pre-dawn to early-morning hours show very low/near-zero visibility (likely fog/ice fog or low stratus), which could create localized slick spots and reduced sight distance on untreated roads even without new snow.

Web verifier initially flagged sub -20°F feels-like, but follow-up shows Weather.com pages were inconsistent (including a Rockford, IL mis-match and wrong-date headers). No authoritative NWS point forecast was retrievable in-tool to confirm <= -20°F. Therefore I do NOT apply the near-automatic closure modifier.\n3) Plow timing math: With no new snow, this is not a “can plows keep up?” event. Infrastructure/safety both indicate major roads should be driveable by 06:30; remaining risk is last-mile neighborhood hard-pack/refreeze and bridge decks.\n4) Any ice? No freezing rain is forecast Friday, but refreeze/carryover ice risk is moderate (especially bridges, shaded roads, intersections).\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 01/30 closures/delays surfaced on nearby district sites or in the closings snippet. No +15–20% momentum bump.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages are extremely low; no clear evidence of Rockford-area facility outages. No outage bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: Dangerous <= -20°F is unconfirmed; most consistent date-specific source (WeatherAPI) is around -4 to -6°F at commute—unpleasant but not typically closure-triggering.\n8) What would make me wrong? If dense fog/ice fog becomes widespread and persistent (e.g., <=0.10–0.25 mi across most of the district through ~07:30–08:00) OR if secondary roads show widespread continuous glare ice causing operational failures (slide-offs, buses unable to safely turn/stop).\n\nProbability call: Baseline for “dry, cold, light wind” is low (single digits to teens). I raise to 22% mainly for the near-zero visibility risk window plus refreeze uncertainty (and the inability to fully verify NWS wind chill/visibility).

With no new snow/ice falling on Friday 2026-01-30, most districts can operate if primary routes are treated. The two things that can still trip a decision are (1) widespread dense fog/ice fog dropping visibility toward near-zero during 06:00–09:00, and (2) widespread refreeze/glare ice on secondary/residential streets from any leftover moisture. The forecast shows the visibility risk is plausible, and the cold makes any slickness persistent, but wind is light and there’s no active precipitation—so the most likely outcome is school open (possibly with localized delays or extra cautions). I therefore land in the high-teens for a full ‘snow day’ closure probability."

The meteorology inputs also point away from a classic snow-day setup (no accumulating snow, light winds). That said, the commute window has two non-snow hazards that can trigger delays: very low visibility indicated for several hours pre-dawn and the possibility of refreeze/glare ice from prior moisture.
