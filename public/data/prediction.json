That is well above the -20°F automatic-closure wind-chill threshold. However, the required independent cross-check against Weather.com / AccuWeather / Weather.gov specifically for Mon 2026-02-23 (6–8 AM) could not be cleanly validated with the web pulls available: Weather.com returned mixed hourly blocks that appear to be for different dates (e.g., 'Monday, February 16') rather than Monday 2/23; I could not directly fetch the NWS point/hourly forecast via api.weather.gov due to environment restrictions; and other web sources retrieved were not explicitly tied to the target date/time. Therefore: I can confirm there is no evidence (from what was retrievable) of wind chills ≤ -20°F, but I cannot confidently state what the public-facing apps will show for Rockford, MI at 6–8 AM on Monday 2026-02-23 without a cleaner dated hourly page from each provider.",

The provided forecast context nearest the target window shows none of these—Sunday is cold/overcast and dry with light-to-moderate northerly flow. That pattern historically corresponds to a very low closure rate.

The plausible hazard is patchy black ice during the 6–8 AM commute due to subfreezing temps and any leftover moisture, plus potential localized low visibility. Those conditions usually lead to heightened caution, targeted salting, and occasionally a *delay* rather than a closure. I’m placing snow-day probability at 4% to account for (a) an unmodeled narrow band/clipper or lake-effect burst late Sun night into early Mon, (b) an unexpected flash-freeze of residual wet pavement, or (c) lingering localized power/traffic-signal issues from the Fri 2/20 wind event—none of which are currently supported strongly by the data shown.",

In the material provided, none of those precursors exist for Monday, Feb 23, 2026 in Rockford, MI. Given peer met/history/safety analyses also point to a dry, non-disruptive pattern (with only localized refreeze as a minor hazard), I land in the low single digits for a full snow day. I’m slightly above ~1% because (a) there is a visibility dip shown in the hourly data (down to ~1 mile at times on 2/22) and (b) there’s a known data gap for Monday-specific hourlies, so an unmodeled narrow band / flash-freeze scenario can’t be ruled out entirely 3 days out.",

The only plausible weather-driven disruption pathway for Mon 2026-02-23 would be a localized, unmodeled event (e.g., a narrow lake-effect band or an unexpected flash-freeze after moisture), but there’s no direct signal for that in the provided forecast snapshot.

The provided forecast context nearest the target window shows none of these—Sunday is cold/overcast and dry with light-to-moderate northerly flow. That pattern historically corresponds to a very low closure rate. I therefore set a low but non-zero probability (4%) to account for (a) unmodeled lake-effect/clipper banding overnight Sunday into Monday, or (b) localized flash-freeze/visibility issues severe enough to force a districtwide call (more likely a delay than a closure)."

The plausible hazard is patchy black ice during the 6–8 AM commute due to subfreezing temps and any leftover moisture, plus potential localized low visibility. Those conditions usually lead to heightened caution, targeted salting, and occasionally a *delay* rather than a closure. I’m placing snow-day probability at 4% to account for (a) an unmodeled narrow band/clipper or lake-effect burst late Sun night into early Mon, (b) an unexpected flash-freeze of residual wet pavement, or (c) lingering localized power/traffic-signal issues from the Fri 2/20 wind event—none of which are currently supported strongly by the data shown."

In the material provided, none of those precursors exist for Monday, Feb 23, 2026 in Rockford, MI. Given peer met/history/safety analyses also point to a dry, non-disruptive pattern (with only localized refreeze as a minor hazard), I land in the low single digits for a full snow day. I’m slightly above ~1% because (a) there is a visibility dip shown in the hourly data (down to ~1 mile at times on 2/22) and (b) there’s a known data gap for Monday-specific hourlies, so an unmodeled narrow band / flash-freeze scenario can’t be ruled out entirely 3 days out."
