Temps hover safely above freezing all night (low ~34°F) and rise into the mid/upper 30s by the morning commute, so accumulation from wintry precip is not expected. The main impacts are periods of moderate rain (notably around ~5 AM and again near ~8 AM) and reduced visibility at times (down to ~1 mile overnight). Winds are breezy but not damaging (gusts ~20–27 mph). Wind chills during bus time are roughly mid-20s (around 25–27°F), nowhere near cold-closure thresholds. From a Michigan school-operations standpoint: roads stay wet rather than snow-covered, plows/salt are not the limiting factor, and there’s no active snow at bus time. Snow day probability is very low (near 0–5%); the only realistic disruption would be localized ponding or brief low-visibility issues, which typically do not trigger district-wide closure in West Michigan."

Weather.com’s hourly view for Wed morning is similar in magnitude, showing 8 AM ~35°F with ‘Feels Like’ ~29°F, and nearby hours in the low 30s feel-like range. No credible web source found indicates wind chill anywhere near the -20°F closure threshold for that morning.\n\nHowever, there IS a meaningful forecast-shape discrepancy on precipitation and daytime temperatures: your WeatherAPI data calls for a rainy day (0.53\" liquid) but with a much cooler high (~49°F). Timeanddate’s extended forecast for Wed 2/18 shows a warmer high (~55°F) and lists ‘Feels Like’ around ~51°F for the day, with ~0.55\" precip—closer on rainfall total but warmer overall. Weather.com’s excerpted hours show rain overnight/early and then cloudier/drier periods later; it does not support an extreme-cold scenario.\n\nBottom line for snow-day risk: this looks like a wet/rainy (possibly foggy) morning with above-freezing temps, not a snow/ice or extreme-cold closure setup. The closure trigger condition (≤ -20°F wind chill) is NOT met by the API and is NOT corroborated by the web sources checked.",

Web verification does not show any wind chill anywhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds, and snowfall is consistently 0\" across sources. With Michigan’s high snow-day bar, that combination strongly favors OPEN.\n\nThe only meaningful disagreement was how to interpret “moderate” ice risk. I resolve it as a *localized hazard* rather than a district-wide closure driver: bridges/overpasses and low-traffic rural connectors can briefly glaze if pavement temps lag air temps near daybreak, especially right as rain begins (~5 AM). That scenario more often produces slower travel and possibly a DELAY, not a full closure.\n\nNews intelligence provides a key tiebreaker: no verified Rockford or neighboring-district closure announcements and no community buzz, reducing the likelihood of a proactive closure. Infrastructure and power-grid checks show no strong operational constraint (no plowable snow; low outage risk). Net: low single-digit-to-low-teens closure odds; I set 9% to reflect the non-zero “black ice surprise” tail risk during 5–9 AM while still being decisive that the most likely outcome is OPEN (possibly with a short delay if observations deteriorate).",
