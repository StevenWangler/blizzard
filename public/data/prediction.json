There is no forecast precipitation (0\" snow, 0\" liquid) and no freezing rain or mixed precip—just overcast to partly cloudy skies. Winds from the WNW around 7–12 mph with gusts up to the mid-teens produce some bite but are not hazardous. Visibility holds generally around 6 miles, briefly 3–5 miles overnight, and there are no weather alerts. In a Michigan context—with no accumulating snow, no ice, and dry roads by the morning—these conditions are well within normal winter operating range.

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast for Friday, 2026-01-02 in Rockford, Michigan, the probability of a snow day closure is extremely low. During the critical morning window (approximately 5:00–9:00 AM), conditions are cold but routine for West Michigan: air temps around 23–24°F, wind chills roughly in the upper single digits to mid-teens above zero, WNW winds near 8–10 mph, no new snow (0.0 cm), no mixed precipitation, and good visibility. Totalsnow_cm for the entire day is 0, totalprecip_mm is 0, and the sky transitions from overcast before sunrise to partly cloudy during the day. Historically, Michigan districts—including Rockford—rarely close for this type of day. Typical closure triggers here include: (1) a significant ongoing snow event with roughly 8–10+ inches and poor timing, (2) widespread ice or glazing from freezing rain making roads impassable, or (3) extreme cold with wind chills below about -15°F. None of those thresholds are met or even approached on this date. The preceding day (Thursday) does have some light freezing rain and light snow, but amounts are small, and by Thursday evening/overnight, treatment and traffic usually improve main routes. With no additional overnight precipitation and only modest winds, conditions generally improve rather than deteriorate into Friday morning. Comparing to similar early-January patterns in West Michigan—calm, dry, mid-20s°F, partly cloudy, no alerts—the closure rate has been very close to zero, limited mostly to isolated circumstances (e.g., localized power issues or non-weather emergencies). Therefore, in historical context for this location and time of year, this forecast strongly aligns with a normal in-session school day, and the chance of a weather-related snow day on Friday, 2026-01-02 is extremely low, with high confidence."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Cold, quiet day; 0\" new snow, no ice, normal winter wind and visibility, essentially 0% snow-day risk from weather.\n- Historian: Similar past patterns (dry, mid-20s°F, no alerts) have ~1–2% closure rates in West Michigan; closures typically require active heavy snow, significant ice, or extreme cold—none present.\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely in good shape with treatment from the prior day; minor slick spots only; risk level explicitly \"low\" and states weather alone does not justify a closure or delay.\n- News Intel: Jan 2 is a scheduled winter-break day, not a weather closure; regional weather is wintry but not extreme, and there is no signal of a special weather-based shutdown.\n=> Consensus: Weather is routine for Michigan; no snow-day-caliber event; and school is not in session anyway.\n\n2. Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Very minor tension: meteorological feed here shows 0\" snow and fully dry conditions, while broader news coverage mentions ongoing lake-effect snow in the region into Jan 2 with several inches possible in parts of West Michigan. However, the local expert summaries (meteorology, history, safety) all converge on: no impactful new accumulation for Rockford itself during the school window, no active alerts, and treated roads.\n- All four agree on low risk for a weather-driven closure. There is no substantive disagreement about hazards for Rockford.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Provided meteorological analysis shows 0% snow probability overnight and in the morning; effectively, there is no new snow event to clear between midnight and the bus window.\n- Any prior light snow/freezing drizzle occurred on Thursday (Jan 1). Safety notes that Thursday evening treatment and traffic should leave primary/secondary roads in good to very good shape by Friday morning.\n- With no ongoing snow, plows and salt crews have the entire night and early morning to clean up and re-treat any slick spots. Functionally, that’s many hours (likely 8+ hours) between last meaningful precip and a typical start time like 7:40 AM.\n- Result: Plow timing is extremely favorable; there is no active storm compressing cleanup time.\n\n4. Is there ANY ice?\n- Meteorologist: explicitly states no freezing rain or mixed precip for Friday; just cold, dry conditions.\n- Historian: mentions previous day had some light freezing rain/snow but in small amounts, with improving conditions into Friday.\n- Safety: flags a \"moderate\" ice-formation risk only in the sense of refreeze on untreated moisture—residual slick spots on side streets, lots, bridges. Primary/secondary roads scored 8–9/10.\n- News Intel: No reports of widespread, crippling glazing or power issues in Rockford/Kent County on Jan 2.\n=> There may be patchy black ice on untreated surfaces, but not a systemic ice storm. This is below the district’s usual closure threshold.\n\n5. What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News Intel: Kent ISD-area districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, etc.) share a similar winter-break window. They are not announcing snow days for Jan 2 because school is not scheduled; closures are calendar-based, not weather-based.\n- No cluster of emergency weather closures or domino-effect decisions exists for this date.\n=> Per the competition rules, we would normally adjust if 3+ neighbors closed for weather (+15–20%), but here the surrounding non-session status is unrelated to weather, so no upward snow-day probability adjustment is warranted.\n\n6. What would make me WRONG?\n- Upside risk (actual closure higher than predicted):\n  • A localized, unforecast lake-effect band sets up squarely over Rockford overnight, dropping several inches (4\"+) of sudden snow and creating hazardous, snow-covered roads by morning.\n  • A surprise freezing drizzle event ices over treated roads, creating a de facto ice storm with many accidents.\n  • Non-weather operational issues (major power outage, heating failure, transportation breakdown) prompt a closure on a day that would otherwise be school in session.\n- Downside risk (probability overstated):\n  • Since Jan 2 is officially part of winter break, the true “weather-related snow day probability” is arguably 0%, because there is no decision to make. Assigning 1% covers only the very low chance of a misinterpreted or emergency-style weather closure on some unscheduled activity.\n\nWEIGHTING OF EXPERTS\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong, detailed signal of calm, cold, dry weather—no snow, no ice, no visibility crisis, no alerts. On Michigan thresholds (<4\" with no ice → 5–15% under normal circumstances), this event sits at the very bottom of that range, effectively near 0 since even the 4\" threshold is not met.\n- Safety (25% weight): Road and walking conditions rated good; ice risk limited to isolated untreated spots. Safety explicitly states low likelihood that weather alone would justify a snow day or delay.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs with similar parameters yield only about a 1–2% closure rate. This aligns with the meteorological and safety assessments and anchors the lower bound.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight – the \"secret weapon\"): Confirms:\n  • Rockford is on winter break through Jan 4; Jan 2 is not a regular school day.\n  • Neighboring districts are likewise on break; there is no regional wave of weather closures.\n  • Community chatter treats this as typical winter weather, not a major emergency.\n  This strongly pushes the effective weather-driven snow day probability toward 0, since there is literally no in-session decision to flip to \"closed.\"\n\nPROBABILITY DECISION\n- If this were a normal session day with this exact forecast (no snow, no ice, calm cold), meteorology + history + safety would imply on the order of 1–3% closure risk.\n- Given that Jan 2 is actually a planned no-school day, the relevant question becomes: what is the chance of a *weather-related* snow day decision? That is effectively at the floor—there is no need for such a decision, and no indication of emergency closure of facilities.\n- To avoid a deceptive literal 0 while remaining realistically at the floor for Brier scoring, I set:\n  • Snow day probability = 1%\n\nThis respects the low-but-nonzero noise level historically, while recognizing that all four expert domains—including the decisive calendar intel—argue overwhelmingly against a weather-driven snow day.\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL\n- Agreement across all experts is unusually strong, and the forecast is simple (no mixed precip, no storm). \n- The only notable uncertainty is the small possibility of an unmodeled localized band or surprise icing, which history suggests is rare at this level.\n- Therefore, confidence is VERY HIGH that there will be no additional weather-based snow day decision for Rockford on Friday, Jan 2, 2026.",
