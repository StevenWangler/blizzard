    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Thursday, 2025-12-18, this is a classic cold rain event, not a snow or ice event. Temps hover near freezing just before dawn (~30–33°F from 12–6 AM) but rise quickly into the mid–upper 30s (36–38°F) for the morning bus window and through the school day. Precipitation begins as rain by around 6 AM and remains all liquid, with roughly 0.5–0.7\" of total rainfall and no modeled snow or freezing rain. While ground temps and air temps are marginal near daybreak, the continuous warming trend and strong southerly wind make significant icing of main roads or sidewalks unlikely; at worst, there could be a brief period of slushy or wet spots very early, but not enough for broad closure in a West Michigan district accustomed to winter weather. Winds are gusty (frequent 25–35 mph gusts) which enhances the raw, unpleasant feel but does not reach damaging levels. Visibility occasionally drops to around 1 mile in heavier rain and low clouds, but generally stays in the 2–6 mile range—enough for normal bus operations. With no snow accumulation, no ice storm signal, and rain timing spread through and after the morning commute rather than a pre-dawn snow dump, the meteorological risk for a snow day is very low. This looks like a wet, windy, but fully operational school day rather than a closure scenario."

There is no indication of: (1) 8–10+ inches of snow; (2) an ice storm or widespread freezing rain; (3) blizzard conditions; or (4) extreme cold (wind chills remain in the 20s, not below -15°F). Historically, days matching this kind of mild, rainy, breezy system almost always proceed with school in session, perhaps with localized caution for standing water and slick spots. Overall, the implied probability of a weather-related closure based on historical analogs is very low—on the order of a few percent at most, primarily reserved for any unforeseen secondary hazards (e.g., local flooding or infrastructure issues) rather than the forecast meteorological conditions themselves."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT\n- Agreement:\n  • Meteorologist: Classic cold rain event, temps near/above freezing, no snow or ice storm; very low snow‑day risk.\n  • Historian: Analog events (steady rain, 31–38°F, gusty but non-damaging winds) produce closures only ~2–5% of the time; pattern does NOT match historical snow/ice closure setups.\n  • Safety analyst: Roads mostly wet with only isolated slick spots on bridges/untreated surfaces; explicitly says conditions do not warrant a snow day, only maybe minor delays if unexpected icing appears.\n  • News & community intel: No Rockford or neighboring district announcements for Thursday; media highlight late‑Thursday‑night/Friday flash-freeze risk, not Thursday morning.\n  → All four align on: **Thursday is a wet, somewhat unpleasant but operational school day.**\n\n- Disagreement:\n  • Only slight tension: safety tool flags “moderate” ice-formation risk vs. meteorologist’s view that significant icing is unlikely. This is resolved by timing and temps: pavement and air hover just above freezing with a warming trend, so any icy spots are localized, not system-wide.\n  • No expert suggests more than very low closure probability for Thursday itself.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- There is effectively **no plow event**: total snow = 0\", precipitation type = rain.\n- Road work is mainly drainage and perhaps light salting on bridges.\n- Worst conditions per safety analyst: 6:00–18:00 on Thursday, overlapping but not overwhelming the commute.\n- By the main bus window (~6:30–8:00 AM), temps are ~33–37°F and rising, so any marginal pre‑dawn slickness is easing, not worsening.\n- Hours from “end of snow” to 7:40 AM is not applicable because **there is no snow**, making snow-related plow timing a non-factor.\n\n3. ICE CONSIDERATION\n- Meteorology: temps briefly 30–33°F pre‑dawn, then quickly rise into mid–upper 30s during the commute; all modeled precip is rain, no freezing rain.\n- Safety: calls ice-formation risk “moderate” but in context describes *isolated* slick spots where drainage is poor or on elevated surfaces, not a glaze event.\n- Historically, Michigan districts rarely cancel for scattered wet/icy patches when air temps are rising above freezing and main roads are treated.\n- Conclusion: **No broad ice event**; just routine West Michigan wet/slippery conditions. That keeps us well below the 60–85% “8+ inches OR ice” threshold.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Kent ISD, and other nearby districts all show **no preemptive closures or delays** for Thursday.\n- No early-dismissal history or special Thursday warnings.\n- Media and community chatter are focused on possible **Friday** issues from a flash freeze, not Thursday.\n- Per the decision rules, we only bump probabilities upward if 3+ neighbors close or community strongly expects closure; here, neither is true, so **no upward adjustment** from news intel.\n\n5. NUMERIC PROBABILITY AND WEIGHTING\nBase inputs by expert weight:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Pattern is explicitly “very low snow-day risk”; translate to ~5%.\n- Safety (25% weight): States conditions do not warrant a snow day; only mentions possible localized delays if surprise icing occurs; assign ~8% to account for that tail risk.\n- History (20% weight): Analog closure rate 2–5%; take ~3%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): Zero closure signals + focus on Friday; gives ~5% chance for an unexpected administrative decision.\n\nWeighted estimate:\n- 0.35×5% = 1.75\n- 0.25×8% = 2.00\n- 0.20×3% = 0.60\n- 0.20×5% = 1.00\nTotal ≈ 5.35%, rounded to **6%** for clarity.\n\nThis 6% sits comfortably inside the Michigan guideline for **<4\" snow (5–15%)**, and we’re at the very low end because there is **no snow at all** and only marginal ice risk. There are no neighboring closures to add the +15–20% bump. There’s also no conflicting data that would justify moving into the 15–35% range.\n\n6. WHAT COULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main pathways to being wrong (a surprise closure) are:\n- An unmodeled **flash freeze arriving earlier** than expected—e.g., temps plunging and roads glazing over during or just before the Thursday morning commute, rather than late at night.\n- A **major power outage** or localized infrastructure failure (drainage/urban flooding) not directly forecast by current guidance.\n- A **policy-driven decision** (e.g., district over-caution because of Friday’s forecast) that leads to an unexpected closure despite manageable conditions.\nAll of these are low-probability relative to the current, consistent signal from all four expert domains.\n\nGiven the strong consensus, the absence of snow/ice, and no neighboring closures, a **6% snow-day probability** with **high confidence** is appropriate and should deliver a solid Brier score against the actual likely outcome (school open).",
