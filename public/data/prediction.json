    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Friday, January 9, 2026, the setup is a warm, very wet, and breezy system, *not* a snow or ice event. Temperatures stay well above freezing (mid‑40s to around 50°F) during all significant precipitation hours (roughly midnight through midday), then slowly fall toward the mid‑30s after school hours with no additional precipitation. Forecast guidance shows about 1.1\" of total liquid, mainly as periods of moderate to heavy rain and some embedded thunder overnight. Roads will be wet, with potential ponding and some reduced visibility (down to ~1 mile at times), but surface temps are too warm for accumulating snow or widespread freezing. Winds are gusty (frequent 25–35 mph gusts overnight and early morning) but below typical high‑wind closure thresholds and gradually ease through the school day. By 5–7 AM, it is still raining with temps upper‑40s and gusty SSW winds; by the main bus window (7–9 AM) it is a milder, rainy, breezy commute with some pockets of heavier showers, but no winter‑type road hazard. Afternoon brings mostly overcast, drying conditions in the upper‑30s with wind chills near freezing, but roads remain just wet. In a Michigan context—where several inches of snow or clear ice are usually needed to close—this is a classic \"soaker\" system rather than a snow day pattern.\n\nGiven the above, the probability of a **full snow day closure** for Rockford Public Schools on Friday 1/9/2026 is **very low (~5% or less)**. A **delay is also unlikely (~10% or less)** unless localized flooding or brief power issues emerge, which are not strongly indicated by the forecast. Expect **school to be open on time**, with rain‑slick roads, reduced visibility at times, and a mild, wet day rather than any significant snow or ice-related disruptions."

        "Localized ponding in low‑lying or poorly drained spots is possible with >1\" of rain, but this usually translates into slower travel rather than a systemic inability to run buses."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford sits only modestly higher than Grand Rapids and surrounding communities. That slight elevation difference can matter when the air mass is marginally freezing—tipping rain to freezing drizzle or snow—but in this case the entire layer is warm enough that precipitation stays all liquid during the commute and daytime period."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the forecast for Friday, January 9, 2026, Rockford, MI is expected to be in a warm, rainy sector: temperatures in the upper 40s to low 50s°F through the morning and midday, with steady to occasionally heavy rain and embedded thunder overnight tapering to lighter showers and then overcast skies by afternoon. Winds are breezy (sustained in the teens with gusts mainly 25–35 mph), and total rainfall is around 1.1\". Critically, there is no snow in the forecast, totalsnow_cm is 0, and the minimum temperature for the calendar day remains just above freezing (around 32–33°F) and does so after the main precipitation has ended.\n\nIn Michigan, school closures for winter weather are most commonly associated with: (1) significant snow accumulations (often 8–10\"+ in 12–24 hours, particularly if timing coincides with commutes), (2) ice storms or widespread freezing rain creating hazardous roads, or (3) extreme cold/wind chills below about –15°F. This forecast meets none of those core criteria. While there is an NWS Special Weather Statement on January 8 for patchy morning icing from fog and near‑freezing temps, conditions trend warmer through January 8 and remain solidly above freezing during the overnight period into the Friday morning commute. That evolution typically *reduces* rather than increases closure risk.\n\nHistorically in West Michigan districts like Rockford, a warm‑sector January rainstorm with temperatures safely above freezing, even with brief heavy downpours and gusty winds, almost never produces a snow day. Impacts tend to be slower traffic, some standing water, and possibly minor hydroplaning risks—but buses and cars generally operate with caution rather than cancellation. Given the absence of snow, freezing rain, or dangerous cold, and only moderate winds, the historical analogs strongly suggest a very low probability of school closure for weather on Friday, January 9, 2026.\n\nOverall, after comparing this pattern to similar past January events in the Rockford/Grand Rapids area, the chance of a weather‑driven snow day (or rain day) is very low—on the order of only a few percent—barring an unforeseen, much colder and icier shift in the forecast that is not indicated by the current data."

    "decision_rationale": "1. AGREEMENTS AMONG EXPERTS\n- Meteorology, history, safety, and news intel all align that this is a warm, rainy, non‑winter‑storm setup.\n- Temperatures: All sources indicate temps solidly above freezing (mid‑40s to around 50°F) during the overnight through morning commute and school day.\n- Precipitation type: 100% rain, no accumulating snow, and no freezing rain during school hours.\n- Impacts: Wet roads, some ponding, reduced visibility at times, and breezy winds—none of which reach typical closure thresholds in Michigan.\n- Historical context: Similar warm‑sector rain events in January almost never produce snow days in West Michigan.\n- Local signals: No district announcements, no neighboring closures, no outage reports, and no community “this will be bad” buzz.\n\n2. DISAGREEMENTS OR TENSIONS\n- There are no material conflicts. The safety analyst labels risk level as “moderate,” but the narrative explicitly supports normal operations with caution for wet roads and visibility. This is compatible with the meteorologist’s \"very low\" closure probability and the historian’s ~1–3% historical closure rate.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM WORST CONDITIONS TO 7:40 AM)\n- Worst conditions window: roughly 12:00 AM–8:30 AM (steady to heavy rain, some thunder, breezy winds).\n- By 7:40 AM (typical first‑bell/bus arrival window), rain is ongoing but temps are in the upper‑40s°F, with roads wet but not icy.\n- Because there is no snow and minimal ice risk, traditional plow timing (snow removal, drifting) is essentially irrelevant. Road crews mainly deal with drainage; that is already in place and does not require pre‑dawn clearing like a snowstorm would.\n- Functional conclusion: There is no plow‑clearance constraint between precip end and school start; buses run on wet roads, not through new accumulation.\n\n4. ICE RISK (ICE CHANGES EVERYTHING)\n- Forecast: 0 freezing hours during the significant precip window, overnight low near 41°F, and a rising temperature trend into the morning.\n- Meteorologist notes the earlier Special Weather Statement for Jan 8 (patchy morning icing), but explicitly states that by Jan 9, hazards shift to heavy rain/ponding, not ice.\n- Safety analyst: “ice_formation_risk: low” and supports normal operations.\n- Conclusion: No evidence of widespread ice or freezing rain. This is the key factor keeping the probability very low.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News intel explicitly checked Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD: none show Jan 9 closures or delays as of the evening before.\n- No early event cancellations and no power‑outage clusters.\n- Per your weighting rules, there is no +15–20% bump because there are not 3+ neighboring closures; in fact, the absence of closures supports staying at the lower end of probabilities.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\n- A surprising overnight shift to substantially colder air than forecast, turning rain to freezing rain or wet snow before or during the morning commute.\n- Unexpected localized flooding that becomes significantly worse than modeled, closing key routes or making bus turn‑arounds unsafe.\n- Infrastructure problems such as widespread power outages or downed trees from thunderstorms or non‑forecast stronger winds.\n- Current data from all four experts show none of these as likely; they are low‑probability tail risks.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH YOUR SPECIFIED WEIGHTS)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Meteorologist explicitly gives ~5% closure probability and notes temps well above freezing and all‑rain precip. I take this largely at face value for the physical setup.\n- Safety (25%): Safety analyst rates road/commute conditions as manageable with caution and recommends a normal school day. This strongly supports a low closure probability (on the order of 5–10% at most).\n- History (20%): Historical analogs (similar warm January rain events) show 1–3% snow‑day rates. This nudges the estimate slightly below what a naive forecaster might choose if only looking at \"heavy rain\" subjectively.\n- News intelligence (20%): No neighboring closures, no official concern, and community sentiment is essentially “no buzz.” Under your rules, there is no upward adjustment; if anything, this reinforces staying near the floor.\n\nMICHIGAN THRESHOLDS CONTEXT\n- Expected snow: 0\". By your state‑specific thresholds, <4\" snow should put us in 5–15% range, and this case has no snow and no ice.\n- Winds are breezy, not extreme; no blizzard, no ice storm, and no 8\"+ scenario.\n- Therefore, a value at the bottom of the 5–15% band is justified.\n\nFINAL DECISION\n- Integrating all four expert domains with your weights, I place Rockford Public Schools’ chance of a weather‑driven snow day (or delay) for Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5%, with high confidence.\n- School is overwhelmingly likely to be open on time, with a wet, somewhat slower commute but no systemic safety reason to cancel.\n\nThis stays safely out of the 40–60% “uncertain” band because expert agreement is strong, the weather pattern is well‑behaved and warm, and local/community signals show no emerging red flags.",
