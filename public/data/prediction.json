The forecast shows essentially zero snowfall/precipitation during the school commute, modest NW winds, and wind chills around +13°F—well above Michigan’s dangerous/extreme-cold closure triggers. Infrastructure inputs indicate roads are currently clear with normal winter operations; the only plausible disruption is patchy black ice from refreeze of any residual moisture (bridges, shaded rural connectors, and parking lots), which typically leads to spot salting and cautious driving rather than a district-wide closure. News intelligence introduced a potential conflict (FOX 17 reporting ‘closures amid ongoing snowfall’), but follow-up indicates that story is broad West Michigan context and the accessible closings-page snapshot was not a clean, date-specific confirmation for Wed 2/11; no verified neighboring-district closure announcements were found for that date. Power conditions are quiet with minimal outages. Net: closure is unlikely; the more realistic edge case is a brief delay if pre-dawn scouting finds unexpectedly widespread slickness—currently not supported by the ‘dry roads’ operational quote and the no-precip forecast.",

Winds are not strong enough to produce major drifting and there’s no falling snow to reduce vis during bus time. The only credible school-impacting hazard is localized black ice from refreeze of any moisture left from Tuesday’s warmer temperatures, and possibly some mist-related slickness—however the lowest vis/mist signal in the data is late evening.

In Rockford/Kent County, those days almost never produce full closures unless there’s an unforecast icing mechanism tied to prior-day melting/refreeze or localized freezing fog. Given the forecast shows essentially no precipitation and manageable winds, I’m slightly above the floor (not 1–2%) mainly because Tue (2026-02-10) is mild enough to generate meltwater that can refreeze on bridges, shaded neighborhoods, and rural connectors before first bus routes. That scenario more often yields isolated slick reports and occasional delays than district-wide cancellation, so I land at 4%.",

The only plausible safety-driven disruptor is isolated black ice from Tuesday’s thaw and refreeze—this can justify a delay in some districts if widespread slickness is observed pre-dawn, but it more often results in targeted salting and slower travel rather than a full closure.

For Rockford, MI on Wed 2026-02-11, the only strong narrative pointer is a FOX 17 weather write-up suggesting closures were being announced somewhere in West Michigan. However, the concrete closure indicators available at the same time cut the other way: FOX 17’s closings page showed none active, and Rockford Public Schools didn’t display a closure/delay message. Combined with the meteorology consensus (cold, windy but manageable; essentially no snow/ice forecast during commute) this looks much more like a normal winter day where the primary risk is isolated black ice and possibly a delay for a subset of districts—not a broad closure. I therefore put the snow-day probability in the single digits, slightly above the purely meteorology-based floor to account for the possibility that the FOX 17 “closures” story reflects localized lake-effect bands or overnight deterioration not captured in the point forecast (or that closures start posting after the last check).",

        "shiftReason": "For Wednesday, Feb 11, 2026 in Rockford, MI, the forecast is dominated by cold, overcast, and dry conditions. The commute period (roughly 6–9 AM) shows subfreezing temps in the mid-20s°F with wind chills in the low teens, but essentially zero precip and no forecast accumulation. Winds are not strong enough to produce major drifting and there’s no falling snow to reduce vis during bus time. The only credible school-impacting hazard is localized black ice from refreeze of any moisture left from Tuesday’s warmer temperatures, and possibly some mist-related slickness—however the lowest vis/mist signal in the data is late evening. Given typical West Michigan winter operations, this points to a very low closure probability, with a small tail risk for an early delay if untreated spots ice up unexpectedly."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical decision-pattern standpoint, Wed 2026-02-11 looks like a classic “non-event” winter day: cold, overcast, and dry. In Rockford/Kent County, those days almost never produce full closures unless there’s an unforecast icing mechanism tied to prior-day melting/refreeze or localized freezing fog. Given the forecast shows essentially no precipitation and manageable winds, I’m slightly above the floor (not 1–2%) mainly because Tue (2026-02-10) is mild enough to generate meltwater that can refreeze on bridges, shaded neighborhoods, and rural connectors before first bus routes. That scenario more often yields isolated slick reports and occasional delays than district-wide cancellation, so I land at 4%."

The only plausible safety-driven disruptor is isolated black ice from Tuesday’s thaw and refreeze—this can justify a delay in some districts if widespread slickness is observed pre-dawn, but it more often results in targeted salting and slower travel rather than a full closure. I’m therefore placing snow-day probability in the low single digits, slightly above ‘near-zero’ to account for uncertainty around untreated secondary roads, bridges, and any earlier-than-forecast freezing fog."

        "shiftReason": "As the NEWS specialist, I weight “what districts are actually announcing” and whether there’s a regional closure wave forming. For Rockford, MI on Wed 2026-02-11, the only strong narrative pointer is a FOX 17 weather write-up suggesting closures were being announced somewhere in West Michigan. However, the concrete closure indicators available at the same time cut the other way: FOX 17’s closings page showed none active, and Rockford Public Schools didn’t display a closure/delay message. Combined with the meteorology consensus (cold, windy but manageable; essentially no snow/ice forecast during commute) this looks much more like a normal winter day where the primary risk is isolated black ice and possibly a delay for a subset of districts—not a broad closure. I therefore put the snow-day probability in the single digits, slightly above the purely meteorology-based floor to account for the possibility that the FOX 17 “closures” story reflects localized lake-effect bands or overnight deterioration not captured in the point forecast (or that closures start posting after the last check)."
