Any glaze that forms on untreated roads/bridges could flash-freeze and persist through the morning commute. Winds remain breezy (~13–19 mph) with very dangerous wind chills (around -20°F to -30°F range by early morning), matching the Cold Weather Advisory timing (1 AM Fri onward). Visibility improves to ~6 miles by daybreak, but there are signals for intermittent near-zero visibility periods overnight and possible freezing fog late evening. Net: snow-only closure is unlikely in Michigan given low accumulation and precipitation ending well before/around 4 AM, but an ice-driven delay/closure is plausible if freezing rain/glaze verifies and road crews can’t fully mitigate before buses run."

In Michigan, that usually points to 'school open' or at most a delay, unless (a) wind chills during the 6–9 AM window meet local closure thresholds, or (b) the midnight freezing-rain period produces enough glaze to create widespread slick travel on untreated routes. Confidence is medium that snow alone will not trigger a closure; confidence is lower on the ice impact because small changes in glaze/road treatment can swing decisions."

Your NWS alert text within the API feed reinforces this by stating wind chills as low as 25 below zero are expected (Fri 1 AM–Sat 10 AM). Some Weather.com hourly page captures found during web checks display much warmer 'Feels Like' values (around -23°C to -24°C ≈ -9°F to -11°F) in the visible segments, which conflicts with both the API and the NWS advisory language; this may be due to the page showing a different day/time slice, localization, or caching. Local/regional news articles also reference Friday wind chills in the -20s and at least one report cites a -14°F to -24°F wind chill range, consistent with closure-risk conditions. Net: the best-supported signal for Friday morning in/near Kent County is wind chill potentially below -20°F, which triggers automatic-closure consideration under your stated rule, but at least one major consumer-weather page capture is inconsistent and should be rechecked directly for Fri 1/23 hourly wind chill.",

Roads likely ‘passable but slick’ on main routes; neighborhoods/local streets are the concern.\n2) Disagreement: The biggest conflict was wind chill cross-source; web verification resolved it—Weather.com capture was date-mismatched, while NWS point forecast supports wind chills as low as -28°F. Another tension: corridor article mentioning 1–4\" along/west of US-131 vs API ~0.2\"; this appears corridor-wide and not Rockford-specific, so I treat it as a modest upside-risk rather than the base case.\n3) Plow timing math: Worst precip/icing window ~00:00–04:00. From ~04:00 to 07:40 start time is ~3.5 hours. That’s enough for trunklines/arterials to be improved, but not enough (given night staffing + subzero temps reducing salt effectiveness) to expect residential/bus-stop streets to be reliably good by first pickup.\n4) Ice? Yes—credible light freezing rain/drizzle near midnight. Even a light glaze matters because temps plunge and persist below freezing all day.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel could not confirm any Friday closures/delays posted yet across Forest Hills, GRPS, Kentwood, Northview, Cedar Springs, Godwin Heights, Comstock Park.\n6) Power outages: No confirmed significant outage clusters; tool could not verify interactive-map details. I do not add an outage boost.\n7) Wind chill verification: Confirmed by both WeatherAPI hourly and NWS point forecast (≤ -20°F, potentially near -28°F).\n8) What would make me wrong? (a) If roads are better than expected on local streets by 6–7 AM (aggressive sanding/pretreatment + little/no glaze), schools likely open (possibly with indoor recess). (b) If corridor lake-effect produces closer to 1–4\" locally OR glaze is more widespread than expected, closure probability rises sharply.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% (supports extreme cold + small precip), Safety 20% (moderate road risk but not systemic), History 15% (borderline; delays more common), News 15% (no neighbor closures yet—downward pressure), Infrastructure 10% (local roads likely still slick at 6:30—upward pressure), Power 10% (no strong outage signal—neutral), Web verification 5% (confirms ≤ -20°F—upward pressure).\n\nOutcome: With confirmed ≤ -20°F wind chills (a strong closure trigger) but no confirmed neighbor closures and only light precip totals, I land at 45% for a full closure. I would rate a 2-hour delay as slightly more likely than a full closure given expected marginal neighborhood-road conditions and student exposure risk.",

The peer inputs (Safety/Infrastructure/Meteorology) all raise credible flags that, historically, are the exact ones that occasionally flip districts to a closure even without heavy snow.\n\nNet: I’m placing this below 50% because the *storm-timing and accumulation* don’t historically support widespread closures in this part of Michigan, but I’m materially above a “low” number because wind chill policy and refreeze risk can drive decisions disproportionately in arctic-outbreak situations.",

However, the combination of (1) a short freezing-rain/mix burst around midnight and (2) a rapid drop to near/under 0°F with wind chills in the -20s during the decision window creates a disproportionate hazard: thin glaze + refreeze = persistent black ice on secondary roads and school-property surfaces. Even if main roads are treated, the safety-critical points for school transport are neighborhood pickups, intersections, bridges, and lots—exactly where thin ice causes crashes and delays. Extreme cold also elevates student exposure risk at stops if transportation runs behind.

The lack of an early official closure signal (and minimal outage issues) keeps me below 50%, but the NWS advisory timing + wind chill magnitude keeps me well above a “routine cold day.” Net: I’m at **38%** for a snow day (closure), with a meaningful tail risk for a 2-hour delay instead of closure.",

Those two hazards raise the odds into the ‘meaningful but not favored’ range.

That typically means school stays open.\n\nHowever, the combination of (1) a brief freezing-rain window near midnight, (2) a rapid crash into subzero air, and (3) very low morning wind chills increases the rate of closures vs. a normal “cold but dry” day. The peer inputs (Safety/Infrastructure/Meteorology) all raise credible flags that, historically, are the exact ones that occasionally flip districts to a closure even without heavy snow.\n\nNet: I’m placing this below 50% because the *storm-timing and accumulation* don’t historically support widespread closures in this part of Michigan, but I’m materially above a “low” number because wind chill policy and refreeze risk can drive decisions disproportionately in arctic-outbreak situations."

Accumulating snow is minimal and ends well before the commute, which usually argues for school operating. However, the combination of (1) a short freezing-rain/mix burst around midnight and (2) a rapid drop to near/under 0°F with wind chills in the -20s during the decision window creates a disproportionate hazard: thin glaze + refreeze = persistent black ice on secondary roads and school-property surfaces. Even if main roads are treated, the safety-critical points for school transport are neighborhood pickups, intersections, bridges, and lots—exactly where thin ice causes crashes and delays. Extreme cold also elevates student exposure risk at stops if transportation runs behind. Net: I land in the upper ‘delay-likely / closure-possible’ range, with closure probability below 50% but meaningfully elevated versus a typical light-snow day."

        "shiftReason": "From a news/behavioral standpoint, this looks like a day where districts *consider* action because the hazard is student exposure (wind chills in the -20s) plus potential overnight glazing—not because of heavy snow. That pattern frequently yields a **delay** more than a full closure in West Michigan, especially if main roads are treated by morning. The lack of an early official closure signal (and minimal outage issues) keeps me below 50%, but the NWS advisory timing + wind chill magnitude keeps me well above a “routine cold day.” Net: I’m at **38%** for a snow day (closure), with a meaningful tail risk for a 2-hour delay instead of closure."

          "desc": "ESFGRR\n\nBitterly cold temperatures moving into Michigan over the next few\ndays will increase the risk of ice jams on rivers. While many\nlocations have already frozen over, ongoing ice growth will continue\nto increase in any open water areas.\n\nThese temperatures have not been seen for many years in West\nMichigan, which means that some areas that don't typically\nexperience river ice jams may have issues this year. Ice jams can\nresult in water levels rising much more quickly than usual, which\ncan catch people off guard. Anyone living or working near rivers in\nWest Michigan should prepare now for potential river ice and rising\nwater levels.\n\nWhile temperatures warm up a bit early next week, this overall cold\nweather pattern will continue through at least next week, which will\nkeep ice locked in place on the rivers.\n\n\nYou can always find the latest river level information at water.noaa.\ngov\n",
