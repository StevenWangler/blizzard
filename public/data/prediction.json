Temperatures stay in the teens to lower 20s °F all day, with wind chills near or just below 0°F in the pre-dawn hours and single digits in the morning. NW to WNW winds run around 8–14 mph with gusts into the mid-teens, producing some added chill but no blowing snow issues given the lack of fresh, fluffy accumulation. \n\nAll model hours for the day show 0.0\" new snow, 0.00\" liquid precip, and clear to partly cloudy skies (no rain, no freezing rain, no snow). Visibility holds at 6 miles throughout. The active Winter Weather Advisory for Kent County covers additional 1–3\" of snow and mixed freezing precipitation mainly on Wednesday 2025-12-31, officially in effect until 7:00 AM Thursday; however, the hourly forecast for early Thursday (00:00–07:00) is dry and clear, indicating that any hazardous weather has already passed and this is largely a residual advisory for lingering slick spots.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather, the absence of any accumulating snow, ice, or active precipitation on Thursday itself, and the fact that plows will have had overnight to address Wednesday’s snow/ice before the school morning, the meteorological risk for a snow day on Thursday, 2026-01-01 is very low. The main impact is cold, with some patches of leftover slick pavement possible early, but conditions are otherwise favorable for normal school operations."

    "confidence_assessment": "Overall, this pattern for Thursday, 2026-01-01 in Rockford, Michigan is historically a low-probability snow day setup. The key Michigan closure triggers—ongoing significant snowfall during the morning, ice storm conditions, blizzard criteria, or extreme cold (<-15°F wind chill during bus times)—are not present. Instead, the forecast shows: (1) prior-day advisory snow of roughly 1–3\" with some freezing rain, (2) that system winding down well before the Thursday morning commute, and (3) a cold but dry, sunny/partly cloudy day with morning temperatures in the low teens and wind chills generally around 0 to -5°F when students would be heading to school. Historically in Kent County and similar West Michigan districts, schools almost always remain open under these conditions, perhaps with localized slick spots and minor delays but not full closure. Given the infrastructure, plow response, and the typical winter resilience in this region, confidence is high that this pattern aligns with days when Rockford holds school as normal rather than calling a snow day."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Shows a cold but quiet day on Thursday, Jan 1, 2026: 0\" new snow, no precip, good visibility, teens for temps, wind chills near 0°F at bus times. Advisory is residual from the prior day; active hazards are done. Explicitly calls snow-day risk \"very low\".\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates road conditions as good (primary 9/10, secondary 8/10), walking/driving 7–8/10, and overall risk \"low\". Notes only refreeze patches and says forecast data do NOT warrant a snow day or delay.\n- History (20% weight): Similar past patterns (post-advisory, dry/cold following day) yield ~3–10% closure rates with high confidence, especially in resilient Michigan districts like Rockford.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): Confirms Rockford Public Schools are on Winter Break Dec 22–Jan 4, with Jan 1 already a holiday/non-school day. Neighboring districts likewise are on break, with no weather-driven closure pattern or chatter.\n\nAll four agree there is no active storm or ice event on Jan 1 itself, that conditions are routine for Michigan, and that nothing unusual is prompting concern. The only apparent “conflict” is that we’re evaluating a snow-day decision for a date when school is not scheduled at all.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Worst conditions end: 2025-12-31 (Wednesday). Advisory-level snow/freezing mix is focused on that day.\n- By 00:00 on 2026-01-01, models show dry, clear conditions continuing through the entire morning.\n- Rockford’s first bell is typically around 7:40 AM; the relevant commute window is roughly 6:00–8:00 AM Jan 1.\n- That gives roughly 6–12+ hours after the end of meaningful precipitation for plows and salt crews to clear and treat roads, plus continued cold/dry conditions that stabilize rather than worsen things.\n- Safety analysis confirms this: minimal morning commute impact, minimal afternoon impact, and strong road scores.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- There was some freezing precipitation and slush on Wednesday, so refreeze is possible overnight.\n- Temperatures stay well below freezing with wind chills in the single digits to near 0°F at morning hours.\n- However, this is a classic, routine refreeze scenario: no new freezing rain, no ongoing icing, no significant blowing/drifting. Safety calls ice risk only “moderate,” constrained to patches on untreated secondary surfaces.\n- Michigan thresholds treat this as manageable with standard salting and caution, not as a district-wide closure trigger.\n\n4. Neighboring districts\n- News intel confirms Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and other Kent ISD districts are also on winter break / New Year’s holiday.\n- There is no pattern of weather-driven closures for Jan 1; the lack of closings is because schools are not scheduled to be open, not because of an emerging storm.\n- Therefore, the “3+ neighboring districts closed” bump does not apply—these aren’t weather domino closings, just the common holiday schedule.\n\n5. Weighting the experts\n- Meteorology (35%): Very low risk; no precip, improving roads. Baseline from this alone would be ≈5–10% chance of a weather-based closure on a normal school day.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk; roads 8–9/10. This would nudge probability slightly lower, toward the bottom of that range.\n- History (20%): Analog days show 3–10% snow-day rate, with Rockford typically open. This firmly anchors us in the low single digits.\n- News/Intel (20%): Reveals the key fact: school is already closed for Winter Break/holiday. This effectively turns the “snow-day” question into: “What is the chance of an additional, weather-justified closure on a day with no school scheduled?” That probability is essentially negligible.\n\n6. Translating to a final number\n- If Jan 1 were a regular school day, combining met + safety + history would yield something like 5%: low-end of the Michigan guidance for <4\" and no active storm, with good timing and good roads.\n- Incorporating news intel that there is no school scheduled anyway makes it almost impossible for an official *snow day* to be called in the conventional sense.\n- To avoid an artificial 0% (which can hurt calibration in Brier scoring), I set the probability at 3%: this reflects that, as a matter of policy, a weather closure is extraordinarily unlikely but not literally impossible under very rare administrative decisions.\n\n7. Pre-decision checklist answers\n1) Agreement: All experts agree conditions on Jan 1 are cold but quiet and manageable; main early hazards are only routine slick spots. They also implicitly agree there is no conventional reason for a weather-based closure.\n2) Disagreement: None of substance. Every analysis points in the same “low-risk, school-should-be-open-if-it-were-in-session” direction.\n3) Plow timing: Plows have at least several hours (likely overnight) after Wednesday’s event ends before any hypothetical Thursday morning commute. Safety scores confirm they have ample time.\n4) Any ice?: Only patchy refreeze on untreated surfaces; no active icing (no freezing rain or drizzle). Not the kind of ice that “changes everything.”\n5) Neighboring districts: Also on break/holiday; no wave of weather-driven closings to push probabilities upward.\n6) What would make me wrong?:\n   - A major, unforecast overnight storm (heavy lake-effect band or surprise ice storm) erupting between the analyses and dawn on Jan 1, overwhelming plows and creating widespread hazardous conditions.\n   - A sudden, extreme cold wave dropping wind chills below about -20°F during bus times, prompting a cold-related closure.\n   - An unexpected infrastructure issue (large-scale power outage, water main breaks) not currently indicated by any source.\nNone of these are supported by current data.\n\nConclusion: On purely weather grounds, Jan 1, 2026 is the sort of day Rockford would almost certainly hold school if it were in session. Given that it is part of Winter Break and a New Year’s holiday, the probability of a true, weather-driven “snow day” decision is effectively near zero. I therefore assign a 3% probability with high confidence, heavily grounded in complete agreement across meteorology, safety, history, and news/community intel.",
