      "Secondary/rural roads and subdivisions: higher risk of slick patches from refreeze of Monday’s moisture and from any compacted snow/ice not fully scraped. Bus routes on gravel/low-priority roads are the most likely “problem pockets.”",
      "Visibility is the biggest Tuesday-specific flag: the hourly forecast shows several near-zero visibility hours overnight/early morning (00:00–04:00) and reduced visibility again around 07:00–08:00. Even without snow, this suggests fog/low stratus; if it’s freezing fog, it can also deposit a light glaze on untreated surfaces.",
      "Bus operations: have first-run drivers report in by ~5:45–6:15 AM Tuesday with special attention to bridges, shaded curves, and hill stops. If multiple buses report slide-throughs or stopping-distance issues, consider a delay over a closure (Michigan can usually operate if it’s patchy).",
      "Pedestrian risk: with temps in the teens/low 20s and wind chills around ~15°F during the morning commute, cold is uncomfortable but not a closure trigger. Main hazard for walkers is slick sidewalks/driveways from Monday’s icing/refreeze.",
      "Parking lots/sidewalks at buildings: plan for spot salting early. Lots often lag road treatment and can stay glassy in low spots.",
      "Decision guidance for Rockford (Tuesday 2/3): If roads were heavily iced Monday afternoon/evening and temps stay below freezing all night, a 2-hour delay is the most plausible operational adjustment. Full closure would be unlikely unless there is widespread freezing fog glaze or widespread untreated ice on secondary roads.",

The main plausible failure mode is a ‘cleanup + deep refreeze’ morning: any Monday drizzle/moisture that wasn’t fully treated can freeze hard with an overnight low near 3°F, creating patchy black ice—more likely on secondary/rural roads and bridges than on trunklines/major arterials. Visibility is the biggest wildcard: the meteorology clarification indicates the worst fog/visibility restriction is more likely 1–4 AM, with only a smaller possible dip near 7–8 AM; that timing makes a district-wide cancellation unlikely (a delay is the more typical Michigan response if pockets are slick). \n\nPotential conflict resolved: Web verification shows a large Weather.com vs WeatherAPI temperature/feels-like mismatch, but even the colder Weather.com scenario (~0°F with -13 to -16°F feels-like) does NOT cross the ≤-20°F automatic-closure rule, and winds are light. Therefore, temperature uncertainty alone doesn’t justify a high closure probability; it mainly increases refreeze persistence and supports a ‘watch for delay’ posture rather than a full snow day.\n\nRecommendation (operational): OPEN with monitoring as the base case; the realistic operational adjustment, if needed, is a 2-hour delay (not a closure) if early bus checks find widespread untreated ice or freezing fog glaze during 6–8 AM.",

The forecast for Tue 2026-02-03 is dry, light wind, and cold—conditions that suppress full-closure decisions.

That strongly suppresses full-closure odds in West Michigan. The pathway to a closure is indirect: residual slickness from Monday’s snow/freezing drizzle + strong overnight refreeze, potentially compounded by dense (freezing) fog reducing visibility and adding a light glaze. With winds light and no precip forecast, I’d expect at most localized hazardous spots and possibly a delay in worst-case verification, not a district-wide cancellation. Hence a low but non-zero probability."

The forecast for Tue 2026-02-03 is dry, light wind, and cold—conditions that suppress full-closure decisions. The realistic pathway to a closure is not snowfall but widespread refreeze/black ice plus dense freezing fog during the AM commute; given the data’s fog signal is strongest overnight/late rather than clearly centered on 6–8 AM, I keep the closure probability in the high-single-digits."

The realistic failure mode is widespread refreeze/black ice from Monday’s wintry mix plus dense (possibly freezing) fog near the morning commute, which would elevate crash/slide-off risk and could force at least a delay. Given Michigan’s typical tolerance for patchy slickness and the absence of a new-storm signal, I land at ~9% for a full closure (with a notably higher probability of a delay than a closure)."

For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, those signals are notably absent: no closure/delay announcements found and no clear neighboring-district “early call” pattern. With the provided forecast indicating no new snow/precip and light winds, a full closure is unlikely. The remaining credible risk is a post-event refreeze/black ice scenario from Monday’s snow/freezing drizzle plus potentially poor visibility/freezing fog around commute time—conditions that more often trigger a delay than a closure in this region. Net: low single-digit-to-low-teens risk; I’m landing at 7% for a full snow day (closure)."

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 408 PM EST, an ice jam remains in place on the Muskegon\nriver in southern Newaygo County. The river gauge at Newaygo\nshows water levels remaining at minor flood stage as of\nFriday afternoon. As temperatures warm this weekend, water\nlevels should continue to slowly fall. Shorter periods of\nrising and falling water levels are expected with any shifts\nin the ice.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
