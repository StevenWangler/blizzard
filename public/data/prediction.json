      "Primary routes (131, M-44/Belmont, major arterials) should be in good shape in Michigan with routine MDOT/county treatment—expect mostly bare/wet pavement, but treat bridge decks if they sheen.",
      "Secondary/rural roads: give extra attention to low-traffic stretches (they polish up and stay colder) and to gravel/edge areas where frost can linger; consider minor bus-route adjustments if a specific backroad is known for morning ice.",
      "Parking lots/sidewalks: overcast + high humidity favors frost in untreated lots and at drop-off loops; pre-treat school walks/entries and bus loops before staff arrival.",
      "Cold exposure: wind chills are forecast mostly in the single digits to teens above zero (e.g., ~14–16°F wind chill around 7–9 AM), which is uncomfortable but NOT in the automatic-closure range for Michigan; remind families to bundle up and limit wait times.",

(2) Wind chill: web verifier did not produce a credible, date-specific source showing ≤-20°F for Rockford 6–8 AM; therefore extreme-cold automatic closure rules are not triggered. (3) Domino effect: news intel did not confirm neighboring district closures/delays for Feb 9 and found normal scheduling indicators. (4) Power: the only outage signal is a scattered countywide number without Rockford-specific confirmation; that is not enough to drive a closure probability high.\n\nNet: A full closure is unlikely. The realistic “gotcha” is localized black ice on a handful of routes/bridges or a localized facility power outage—usually handled via spot-salting, route adjustments, and caution messaging rather than a district-wide snow day.",

        "shiftReason": "From a meteorological standpoint, Monday (2026-02-09) in Rockford, MI is a classic “quiet winter” day: overcast under high pressure, subfreezing, and dry. That combination strongly argues against a snow day because there’s no new snowfall/ice accumulation and winds are too light for drifting. The only closure-relevant weather pathway here is localized freezing fog or refreeze/black ice on untreated surfaces during the pre-dawn to early-morning window; given the forecast shows zero precip and modest winds, that risk is real but typically patchy and not district-wide. Net: very low closure probability, nonzero only due to localized ice/fog/antecedent-condition uncertainty."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical-operations perspective for Rockford/West Michigan, a Monday with no forecast snowfall/precipitation, light wind, and temps rising toward ~31°F is overwhelmingly an “open” outcome. The only plausible closure pathway is not meteorological forcing on Feb 9 itself, but residual/antecedent issues: leftover packed snow/ice on low-priority neighborhood roads plus refreeze/black-ice risk in the early morning due to high humidity. That can create isolated hazard pockets, yet historically it’s more likely to produce heightened caution (or at most a delay) than a district-wide snow day. Net: very low snow-day probability, but not absolute zero because antecedent road conditions and a thin glaze from fog/frost can surprise transportation supervisors."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/transport lens, Monday’s forecast reads like an “open, use caution” day: no new snow/ice is expected, winds are modest, and wind chills are uncomfortable but not typically closure-triggering for West Michigan. The only meaningful closure pathway is *localized* black ice/freezing-fog glaze plus any unreported residual icing from prior days—conditions that can cause scattered crashes but usually don’t justify a district-wide snow day unless they’re widespread and verified on key bus routes before 5:30–6:30 AM. I therefore keep probability low but non-zero to account for patchy ice + fog uncertainty and any unmodeled antecedent road condition issues."

Here, Monday’s forecast shows no new snow/ice, Rockford Public Schools has no closure/delay notice posted for Mon 2026-02-09 in the reviewed pages, and the only noteworthy news item is an advisory that expired Friday (Feb 6). That combination supports an “open” expectation, with only a small residual probability for a delay/closure driven by patchy black ice or a localized outage problem that isn’t yet reflected in public-facing updates."
