Temperatures bottom out around 14°F near daybreak, then recover into the upper teens by the 7–9 AM bus/school-start window and warm to near 38°F in the afternoon. Wind is light early (2–4 mph) and increases modestly later (up to ~10–11 mph), so wind chills in the morning are mainly single digits to low teens—well above Michigan’s hard closure thresholds (≤ -20°F). With 0\" snowfall, no ice signal, good visibility (~6 mi), and no NWS alerts, weather-related school closure probability is very low. The only operational note is potential leftover slick spots from Wednesday’s light snow/freezing rain, but Thursday morning itself does not bring new wintry precipitation."

However, as of the latest district-site checks, Rockford Public Schools has not posted an official closure/delay announcement for 2/26 on its main announcements feed, and no confirmed neighboring-district closure announcements were surfaced in the sources I could access.

That is far above the -20°F automatic-closure wind-chill threshold.\n\nHowever, my web cross-check attempt did NOT yield clean, date-matched Feb 26, 2026 hourly 'feels like' values from Weather.com/AccuWeather/NWS in the snippets captured: Weather.com and NWS pages surfaced content that appears to correspond to other dates (e.g., NWS page shows 'Last update Feb 18, 2026' and Weather.com excerpts show very warm 40s/50s). Because those web pulls are time-mismatched/stale, they can’t be used as an independent confirmation of the Feb 26 morning wind chill. With the evidence captured here, the only internally consistent, date-specific dataset is your WeatherAPI payload.\n\nSnow-day implication for Thu 2026-02-26 (based on the API payload): with clear/sunny conditions, no precip, and feels-like around ~10°F during typical 6–8 AM commute, the weather alone does NOT support a closure for snow/ice/extreme cold. Main operational risk would be residual slick spots from prior days, not new snowfall (but that would require road-condition intel).",

The only credible disruption mechanism is residual moisture from Wednesday’s light snow/freezing-rain episodes refreezing overnight into patchy black ice, especially on bridges/overpasses and lower-volume neighborhood/rural roads.\n\nI challenged the low-probability consensus by looking for ‘tie-breaker’ signals that often push Michigan districts into a closure despite quiet weather: (1) extreme wind chill ≤ -20°F (not present in any captured source), (2) widespread icing/freezing rain during bus hours (not supported by the provided Thu hourly forecast), (3) confirmed neighboring-district closures (none verified; FOX 17 shows no active closings), and (4) material power outages (system-wide outages are small; no verified Rockford cluster). The Kent County Road Commission preparation story supports heightened slick-spot vigilance, but it is consistent with a targeted spot-treat response—not a closure trigger by itself.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high bar for full closures, the most likely outcome is OPEN with a cautious message. A short delay is the more plausible “upside risk” than a full snow day if early-morning spot checks find unexpectedly widespread glaze on secondary/bus-route trouble areas. Net: 6% closure probability optimizes for Brier score—low, but not zero—reflecting the real (though usually localized) black-ice surprise pathway.",

Those ingredients strongly favor normal school operations because they *improve* road conditions rather than degrade them.\n\nThe main meteorology-driven concern is not active weather, but *residual impacts* from Wednesday’s wintry mix/light snow: with an overnight low near 14°F, any untreated moisture can refreeze into patchy black ice during the 5–9 AM window. Patchy refreeze can cause isolated bus-route issues, but absent new precip, poor visibility, or strong winds, it usually does not rise to district-wide closure in West Michigan—especially with road crews signaling pre-treatment/early operations.\n\nSo I’m holding snow-day probability low (5%), with most of that probability allocated to a “black ice is worse than expected on rural/secondary roads” scenario rather than a forecasted storm scenario."

In similar late-February West Michigan setups, full snow days are uncommon because road agencies and districts are in full winter-operations mode and conditions tend to improve through the morning. The only credible disruption mechanism is localized refreeze/black ice on untreated secondary/rural roads and bridge decks following Wed Feb 25’s light snow/freezing rain episodes; historically that risk produces isolated slick spots rather than district-wide impassability. Net: low single-digit closure probability; a delay is more plausible than a closure, but still not likely absent evidence of widespread glazing."

With no forecast precipitation and light winds, I do not see a credible pathway to a district-wide closure based purely on Thursday’s weather.\n\nThe only meaningful closure lever is *widespread* black ice during the 5:30–8:00 AM window—if Wednesday’s light snow/freezing-rain left wet pavement that is not adequately treated overnight, the teens temperatures could hard-freeze it. That risk is inherently localized/patchy, and districts usually manage it with treatment + cautious driving rather than closing. I therefore set a low but non-zero probability to account for the possibility that (a) rural route segments are notably slick, and/or (b) multiple crashes/road-condition reports push administrators toward a delay/closure out of caution."

That supports a *non-zero* disruption risk for the Thursday morning commute. However, the actual target-day forecast provided is sunny with zero new precipitation/snow and relatively modest wind—conditions that rarely produce a full snow day in West Michigan. With no official Rockford Public Schools announcement posted in advance, and with road crews actively planning to mitigate slick spots, the most plausible outcome is a normal school day (at most, isolated slick spots or a short delay if early-morning spot checks find unexpected glaze). Net: low single-digit probability for a closure, slightly higher than “near-zero” only because refreeze is a real nuisance risk when temps drop into the teens after light snow/freezing rain the prior day."
