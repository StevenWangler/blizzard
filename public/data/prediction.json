Temperatures rise from ~30-31°F overnight to ~33-34°F by the morning commute with light S winds. No measurable precipitation or snowfall is forecast, and winds are modest (max ~12 mph), so blowing/drifting snow and whiteout conditions are not factors. Given typical Michigan winter operations, a full snow day closure is unlikely; the only plausible disruption would be localized delays if dense freezing fog significantly reduces visibility and creates patchy black ice."

The only realistic pathway is **patchy black ice + very low visibility at bus time** from freezing fog. If the freezing fog is widespread and persists through 7–8 AM, a **2-hour delay becomes plausible**; if it lifts near/just after sunrise, schools usually run. I’d calibrate this as roughly **5–12% chance of closure** and **15–30% chance of a delay**, with confidence medium because fog/ice impacts can vary street-by-street and depend on pavement temps and any unforecast micro-drizzle."

Web verification was unable to cleanly confirm the Feb 16 school-morning hourly wind chill from the primary targets (Weather.com / NWS / AccuWeather) in the retrieved snippets: the Weather.com hourly page that was captured appears to be showing early-February hours (Feb 5–7) rather than Feb 16, and NWS/AccuWeather Feb 16 wind-chill values did not surface in the available crawl results. Secondary web sources and a current-conditions page (The Weather Network) suggest ‘not extreme cold’ conditions (feels-like in the 20s/30s), which is directionally consistent with the API, but this is not a strong multi-source confirmation for the exact Feb 16 6–8 AM window.",

Even if we ignore the calendar and assess weather-only, the meteorology shows 0\" snow/0 precip, light winds, and feels-like temps in the 20s—not an extreme cold closure case. The only meaningful hazard is freezing fog with potential patchy black ice and reduced visibility around 4:00–8:30 AM; historically and operationally in West Michigan, that tends to produce cautions or at most a delay if visibility drops well below ~0.5 mile or glaze becomes widespread. Infrastructure and power-grid signals do not suggest an event that would force closure. Therefore the probability of a weather-driven closure decision for Rockford on Feb 16 is near-zero; I retain 1% only as a guard against a user targeting a different school/day or an unforeseen, unforecast icing event.",

Crucially, peer NEWS analysis claims **this specific Monday (2026-02-16) is already a planned no-school day for Mid-Winter Break** for Rockford Public Schools, which collapses the weather-driven closure probability to ~0 for that date. I leave a small non-zero (2%) to account for the possibility that (a) the calendar signal is wrong for the user’s target school, or (b) the question is generalized beyond RPS and actually asks ‘would it be a snow day if school were scheduled?’",

With zero forecast precip/snow and modest winds, the pathway to a full snow day is narrow: it would require **widespread black ice** (not just isolated slick spots) and/or **persistently poor visibility** at key intersections on bus routes. The forecast does flag freezing fog and a period of reduced visibility roughly 04:00–07:00, overlapping the pre-bus prep window and early commute. That raises the disruption risk somewhat, but given typical West Michigan winter readiness, I’d expect mitigations (spot salting, speed reductions, possible minor hold) to handle it. Net: low closure probability, moderate chance of a delay. Note: if Monday 2026-02-16 is indeed a scheduled Mid-Winter Break (per the News agent), the *weather-driven* closure probability is effectively irrelevant for that district day; my % is purely the weather/safety-based closure likelihood assuming school were otherwise in session.",

That takes the main snow-day drivers (accumulation rate, plow timing, drifting) off the table. The remaining pathway to a closure is non-snow: widespread dense freezing fog causing unsafe bus operations (visibility) plus confirmed widespread glaze/black ice on secondary roads. Given the forecast shows only ~1 mile minimum visibility (not near-whiteout) and temps hovering near/above 32°F by commute time, a **full closure is unlikely**; a **delay** is the more plausible operational outcome if fog/ice verifies worse than forecast. I land at **~6%** closure probability as a meteorology-only estimate (i.e., ignoring the calendar/break information)."

        "shiftReason": "As the history specialist, I weight base rates and decision context. In mid-February, West Michigan districts are operationally prepared; absent accumulating snow, ice accretion, or extreme cold, full closures are uncommon. Here, the weather setup is a classic ‘IFR morning’ (freezing fog, near-freezing temps, high humidity) with no measurable precip—so the historical closure base rate is low. Crucially, peer NEWS analysis claims **this specific Monday (2026-02-16) is already a planned no-school day for Mid-Winter Break** for Rockford Public Schools, which collapses the weather-driven closure probability to ~0 for that date. I leave a small non-zero (2%) to account for the possibility that (a) the calendar signal is wrong for the user’s target school, or (b) the question is generalized beyond RPS and actually asks ‘would it be a snow day if school were scheduled?’"

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, this is an **ice/visibility risk morning**, not a snowstorm. With zero forecast precip/snow and modest winds, the pathway to a full snow day is narrow: it would require **widespread black ice** (not just isolated slick spots) and/or **persistently poor visibility** at key intersections on bus routes. The forecast does flag freezing fog and a period of reduced visibility roughly 04:00–07:00, overlapping the pre-bus prep window and early commute. That raises the disruption risk somewhat, but given typical West Michigan winter readiness, I’d expect mitigations (spot salting, speed reductions, possible minor hold) to handle it. Net: low closure probability, moderate chance of a delay. Note: if Monday 2026-02-16 is indeed a scheduled Mid-Winter Break (per the News agent), the *weather-driven* closure probability is effectively irrelevant for that district day; my % is purely the weather/safety-based closure likelihood assuming school were otherwise in session."

        "shiftReason": "For Monday, February 16, 2026 in Rockford, MI, the district is already closed for Mid-Winter Break per the provided news/district signals, and neighboring districts show the same. That makes the probability of a weather-driven snow day essentially near zero. Even ignoring the scheduled break, the forecast lacks the typical closure drivers (accumulating snow, ice accretion from freezing rain/drizzle, extreme wind chills, widespread power outages). The one flag—freezing fog with reduced visibility and potential black ice in the pre-dawn to early-morning window—would be more consistent with a delay decision on a normal instructional day, not a closure."
