Temperatures stay well below freezing all day (around 18–26°F), with wind chills in the single digits during the morning bus window due to SSW–SW winds of 10–18 mph and gusts up to ~25–30 mph. Roads leading into the school day look quiet: between midnight and the end of the morning commute (through about 9–10 AM) there is no accumulating precipitation, no freezing rain or mixed precip, and visibility generally remains good (around 5–6 miles). The only measurable snow in the 24-hour period is a very light, brief event around 9–11 PM that produces roughly a dusting (~0.02\"), far below Michigan’s typical closure thresholds and well after school dismisses. There are no active weather alerts, no significant icing signals, and no heavy lake-effect or synoptic snow bands crossing during school hours. Overall, this is a routine cold December day for West Michigan with some wind chill but no travel-disrupting snow or ice. From a Michigan school-operations standpoint, the probability of a snow day (closure or major delay) for Monday, 2025-12-15 is extremely low, effectively near 0%."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, Monday, 2025-12-15 in Rockford, Michigan shows: (1) temperatures ranging from about 18°F in the early morning to mid-20s°F in the afternoon; (2) wind chills during the bus window mostly in the 0–10°F range, not the extreme -15°F or colder threshold often associated with cold-related closures; (3) no significant snow or mixed precip during the overnight leading into the morning commute — the day is largely dry and overcast; (4) only very light snow showers indicated late in the evening with negligible total accumulation (on the order of a dusting). For this region and time of year, these are routine winter conditions. Michigan schools, particularly in Kent County and Rockford, rarely close for cold in this range or for trace/light snow. There is no signal of an ice storm, blizzard, rapid heavy snowfall of 8–10+ inches, or dangerously low wind chills during school hours. Given historical behavior of districts under similar patterns, the probability of a snow day (or weather-related closure) for Monday, 2025-12-15 is very low — on the order of a few percent at most, mainly reserved for non-weather reasons (infrastructure issues, isolated power outages, etc.). Overall confidence in a ‘school is open as usual’ outcome is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement vs. conflict\n- Meteorology: Clear, dry to mostly dry day with only a tiny evening dusting; no accumulating snow for the overnight or morning commute; temps in upper teens–20s°F, wind chills single digits. Concludes near‑0% chance of a weather closure.\n- History: Mid‑December cold, cloudy, breezy, with flurries/dusting is a very common pattern. Historical snow‑day rates for similar setups are about 1–5%, with schools almost always open. Emphasizes that closures historically come from 8\"+ snow, ice storms, or extreme wind chills (≈‑15°F or colder), none of which apply.\n- Safety: Primary roads rated 9/10, secondary 8/10, parking lots 8/10, walking/driving conditions 7–8/10, risk level ‘low’. Worst conditions window (00:00–08:00) still only poses minimal morning and afternoon commute impact. Recommends normal operations.\n- News/Intel: No official closure or delay hints from Rockford Public Schools, Kent ISD, or neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville). Media coverage describes typical, nuisance‑level winter conditions, not a major Monday event. Community sentiment: no surge of ‘this is a big storm’ talk; early‑winter has been active, but Monday the 15th is not singled out.\nAll four experts essentially align: this is a routine cold winter day with no active storm during the school window and very low closure likelihood. There are no meaningful conflicts that need tool clarification.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total snow into Monday morning: effectively 0\"; only about 0.02\" as a brief dusting late evening, after school.\n- Snow end vs. start of school: There is no pre‑commute plow event; roads going into Monday morning are dry or just carrying residual from previous days, which crews have ample time to clear well before 7:40 AM.\n- Hours from any light evening snow to next relevant travel: The trace dusting appears after 9–11 PM and is so minimal it doesn’t constitute a plow‑timing problem.\nConclusion: Plow timing is a non‑issue; there is no overnight accumulation to race against.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology shows cold and dry for commute windows with no freezing rain signal.\n- Safety notes only ‘moderate’ general ice formation risk due to cold pavement (meaning isolated slick spots on bridges/shade), not a systemic ice event.\n- History: Major closure‑driving ice storms are absent from this forecast pattern.\nTherefore, there is no meaningful ice storm or glazing event; only routine patchy slick spots that Michigan districts operate in regularly.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news signals\n- Neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville) list Dec 15 as a normal school day, no special weather notes.\n- Kent ISD emphasizes coordinated early‑morning decisions but gives no indication of planning for a mass closure around this date.\n- Local media and NWS discussions reference typical light snow/mix and cold, not a high‑impact Monday storm.\n- Social media/community sentiment is ‘uncertain’ but not strongly pushing for closure or predicting one.\nPer the competition rules, there is no basis for a +15–20% bump for neighboring closures or a +10–15% bump for strong community closure expectations. If anything, the lack of buzz leans toward the low end.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis & weighting\nWeights: Meteorology 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News/Intel 20%.\n- Meteorology implies a closure probability ~1% (effectively 0, but allow tiny residual for non‑weather factors).\n- Safety, given low risk and high road scores, suggests ~2–3% (primarily for unexpected isolated incidents).\n- History shows 1–5% for similar patterns; we take ~3% mid‑range.\n- News/Intel, with no closure hints and no domino effect, also leans ~2–3%.\nWeighted blend: roughly (0.35*1) + (0.25*3) + (0.20*3) + (0.20*3) ≈ 2–3%. No upward adjustments from neighboring closures or community pressure; Michigan threshold rules indicate <4\" with no active storm is normally 5–15%, but this event is even weaker than a typical <4\" event (essentially 0\"), so we stay slightly below that band. To avoid underestimating non‑weather anomalies, I set the final value at 2% instead of 0–1%.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A major, last‑minute forecast bust: unexpected lake‑effect band or clipper dropping several inches (4–8\"+) of snow focused squarely on Kent County between ~3–7 AM Monday.\n- Surprising ice: an unmodeled warm‑layer intrusion producing freezing drizzle or freezing rain overnight, turning roads into a glaze by 5–7 AM.\n- Non‑weather infrastructure failures: widespread power outages, major bus fleet issues, or a significant accident blocking key routes.\nThese are all low‑probability contingencies, but they account for the small non‑zero 2% estimate.\n\nGiven the strong consensus, extremely light/absent precip, and Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter cold, the best calibrated forecast is that school runs on a normal schedule with a very small chance of a last‑minute non‑routine issue.",
