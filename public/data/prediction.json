Calibrated for Michigan: I’d put full closure around ~10–20% (higher end if widespread untreated glaze is confirmed at 5–7 AM), and a 2-hour delay risk around ~15–30%.

    "decision_rationale": "Integrating all inputs, the base case is an OPEN day for Rockford with heightened caution for a narrow morning hazard window. Meteorology indicates a cold, dry Wednesday with no accumulating snow and light wind—normally a near-certain “open” outcome in West Michigan. History and Safety both elevate risk due to antecedent freezing rain/freezing drizzle potential Tuesday plus a hard overnight refreeze into ~2°F, and the forecast includes mist/freezing-fog signals around the morning commute; that combination can produce patchy black ice and sudden visibility drops. However, News Intel finds no confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays and no Rockford weather announcement (beyond the scheduled Early Release), and Power Grid analysis shows negligible outage risk—both reduce the likelihood of a districtwide closure.\n\nKey uncertainty: the Web Weather Verifier flagged a ≤-20°F wind chill on a questionable/stale Weather.com variant. Under the extreme-cold rule, *any credible* ≤-20°F during 6–8 AM would force a 90–95% closure call. Here, the only ≤-20°F values came from a low-reliability, stale/locale-mismatched page, while other sources (WeatherAPI and an NWS-style text forecast) imply wind chills closer to about +7°F to -8°F. The meteorologist follow-up does not support extreme wind chills. Therefore, I do NOT trigger the automatic extreme-cold closure rule, but I keep confidence at “moderate” because if true wind chills were dramatically colder than the point forecast (or if widespread glazing is observed), decision-making could shift quickly.\n\nBottom line: closure is unlikely; the more realistic operational outcome (not asked for in the probability) is a 2-hour delay if early road checks find widespread glare ice or dense fog across multiple zones.",

That combination almost always yields an ‘open’ day in Michigan.\n\nThe only plausible weather-driven disruption mechanism is secondary: residual moisture from Tue’s light freezing rain/freezing drizzle + strong overnight refreeze + patchy mist/freezing fog around the morning commute. That can create localized black ice and pockets of poor visibility. Those hazards more commonly produce slower travel and occasional *delays* rather than a full district-wide closure, unless road checks at ~5:30–6:30 AM find widespread untreated glaze.\n\nGiven the provided forecast (zero precip/snow on Wed, no alerts, modest wind), I land in the single digits for a full snow day (closure). I’d rate delay risk higher than closure, but the prompt asks snow-day probability, so I’m keeping closure low but non-zero due to the refreeze/fog scenario."

        "shiftReason": "As the History specialist, I anchor to how often similar patterns actually produce closures in West Michigan. A cold, dry, light-wind day is almost always an “open” day; the only reason this isn’t ~0–5% is the antecedent freezing-rain signal on Tue 2026-02-03 combined with a sharp refreeze into ~2°F by early Wed. Historically, that specific combo can produce surprise black ice (especially bridges, rural shaded segments, and parking lots/bus loops) and occasionally prompts either a 2-hour delay or—less commonly—a closure if reports show *widespread* glaze by 5:30–7:00 AM. Given no new precip and no strong wind/blizzard component, I keep full-closure probability in the low teens (12%)."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Wednesday 2026-02-04 reads as a “cold + refreeze + fog” day rather than a snow day. That combination can absolutely produce crashes and slip hazards, but in West Michigan it usually leads to targeted mitigation (pre-salting, slower bus operations, spot delays) rather than district-wide closure—unless early-morning checks confirm *widespread* glare ice or consistently dense fog across multiple attendance zones. Given no accumulating snow and light winds, I keep full-closure probability low but non-trivial because the antecedent freezing-rain hangover + 2°F low can create high-consequence black ice, especially on rural routes."

The main pathway to a closure is not snowfall but a **refreeze/black-ice + fog** morning commute window (roughly 6:30–9:30 AM per Safety), which can produce last-minute calls—more commonly a 2-hour delay than a full closure. Given those competing signals, I land at **12%** for a full snow day (closure).
