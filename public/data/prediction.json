Cross-checking on the open web produced conflicting results: a standard Weather.com hourly view for Rockford shows feels-like values around +10°F in the early morning and near +1°F by mid-morning, while a different Weather.com locale/hourly URL snippet shows 'Feels Like' around -23°C to -24°C (≈ -9°F to -11°F), which is still NOT below -20°F but is inconsistent with the +10°F view. Weather Underground content retrieved was not aligned to the target date/time and therefore cannot be used to validate Thu 01/29 hourly wind chills. I did not find a clean, directly-captured NWS point forecast / hourly wind chill table for Rockford for Thu 01/29 in the retrieved snippets, and I also did not retrieve an AccuWeather RealFeel value for Thu 01/29 from the search results returned here. Net: no source captured in this run shows a 'feels like' below -20°F for Rockford on Thu 2026-01-29, but the cross-source agreement is weak/conflicting due to Weather.com page variance and missing NWS/AccuWeather validations in the captured results.

Follow-ups clarify the ice concern is predominantly refreeze/leftover slick spots, not new freezing drizzle. Visibility “0-mile” entries are treated as likely data artifacts absent corroboration.\n3) Plow timing math: With no accumulating snow Thu, this is not a plow-capacity event. There are ~21 hours from Wed lingering impacts to Thu 6:30 AM; main routes are expected serviceable by bus time, but patchy slick spots can persist on low-priority streets/bridges.\n4) Ice present? Potential is moderate but expected to be patchy (bridges, shaded curves, parking lots, subdivisions), not widespread on primaries.\n5) Neighboring districts: Latest checks did not find confirmed Thu 1/29 closures/delays among nearby districts (GRPS/Kentwood/Northview/Sparta/Cedar Springs), and no strong community buzz surfaced.\n6) Power outages: Extremely low; no school-facility outage signal.\n7) Wind chill verification: NWS digital/hourly table confirms ~+1°F wind chill at 6–8 AM Thu—nowhere near ≤ -20°F.\n8) What would make this wrong: If early Thu road checks reveal widespread glaze/hard-pack on secondary/residential bus routes (numerous slide-offs, consistent braking problems), Rockford could opt for a 2-hour delay or, less likely, a closure.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology strongly suppresses closure odds (dry, light wind). Safety/infrastructure keep non-zero risk due to refreeze and patchy black ice. News intel found no neighboring-district closure cascade. Power and web verification remove two major “automatic” drivers (outages, extreme wind chill). Net: low probability of a full snow day; higher probability of a delay than closure.",

That combination points to: schools likely open, with a non-trivial chance of a **delay** if early-morning road checks find widespread black ice on secondary roads/bridges from Wednesday’s wintry mix.
