The primary hazard is dense to freezing fog, with visibilities at or near zero overnight through around 6–7 AM, then generally improving to 6–10 miles during and after the typical morning commute, despite ongoing fog/mist aloft. Winds increase into the 10–15 mph range with gusts into the 20s mph, adding some chill but not enough for blowing snow since no snow is present. Roads may have slick spots from freezing fog deposition on untreated surfaces, especially early, but there is no accumulating snow, no ice storm signal, and conditions gradually improve after sunrise. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather and the lack of plowable snow or significant icing, the meteorological risk for a full snow day closure is very low; at most, districts might consider localized caution or delayed buses if dense freezing fog persists longer than forecast, but widespread cancellation based on this forecast alone is unlikely."

    "confidence_assessment": "Putting this into Michigan snow-day context: \n\n• Snow/Ice Amount: There is no accumulating snow forecast for Tuesday, Jan 6, and no meaningful new freezing rain or drizzle overnight into the morning. The minor freezing rain already occurred early Monday and is not accompanied by heavy follow-up precip or rapidly falling temps.\n\n• Temperature/Wind Chill: Temperatures run about 31–34°F all day, with wind chills roughly mid-20s°F. This is far above the extreme-cold closure trigger (roughly –15°F wind chill or lower) that districts in West Michigan have historically used.\n\n• Wind/Blizzard Risk: Winds peak around 15 mph with gusts into the 20s mph in the afternoon/evening—nowhere near blizzard criteria and with no falling or blowing snow to compound hazards.\n\n• Visibility: The only meaningful hazard signal is dense/freezing fog overnight. Model guidance here is somewhat inconsistent (0 km visibility in hourly data vs. 4–6 mile ‘avgvis’ in the daily summary). In practice, West Michigan has many school days with patchy dense fog; closures for fog alone are uncommon and generally tied to (1) very widespread, persistent near-zero visibility right at bus times across a large portion of the district, and/or (2) simultaneous slick icing that road commissions cannot treat in time. The forecast trend toward improved visibility (near 10 km/6 mi by around 7–9 AM) argues against a district-wide shutdown.\n\n• Historical Analog Behavior: In similar early-January setups in northern Kent County—no active advisories, no accumulating snow, temps near freezing, patchy black ice and fog—districts almost always hold school, sometimes with a cautionary note to families or a localized bus delay if a particular valley or back-road area is especially foggy. Closures on days like this are historically rare (<10%).\n\nOverall, based on historical patterns for Rockford and surrounding Michigan districts, these conditions are well below the usual thresholds for a snow/ice day. While there is a non-zero chance of localized slick spots and morning fog creating some transportation caution, the probability that this particular setup leads to a full snow day on Tuesday, 2026-01-06 is low, and historical analogs support school being in session under similar weather patterns."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorologist, Historian, Safety Analyst, and News Intel (via cross-check) all agree on the core setup:\n  • No accumulating snow overnight into Tuesday (0.0\" forecast, 0% snow probability).\n  • No modeled freezing rain or measurable new ice; any hazard is from freezing fog/black ice, not a glaze or storm.\n  • Temps steady around 31–33°F with mid‑20s°F wind chills – far from Michigan’s extreme‑cold closure thresholds.\n  • Dense/freezing fog overnight with worst vis 12–6 AM, then significant improvement by the main bus/commute window (7–9 AM).\n  • Main roads are expected to be treatable and mostly wet with isolated slick spots by school time; rural/low‑spot pockets remain the key caution.\n  • All explicitly state this pattern does NOT justify a full snow day in typical West Michigan practice; at most, extra caution or perhaps localized delays in an extreme fog pocket case.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS\n- The only apparent “disagreement” is tonal:\n  • Meteorologist & Historian frame overall snow‑day risk as LOW.\n  • Safety Analyst labels operational risk as MODERATE, but still concludes a full snow day is not warranted.\n  • News Intel highlights a regional school‑closing outlook indicating some risk in West Michigan, but clarifies that Rockford’s specific signals are weak (no closures announced, mixed sentiment, no major outages/road emergencies).\n- After cross‑check, this isn’t a true conflict: safety’s “moderate” is about localized black‑ice and fog hazards for drivers/walkers, not about district‑wide closure likelihood.\n\n3. PLOW/TREATMENT TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions (freezing fog + patchy black ice) are from ~00:00–06:00/07:00.\n- Main bus/traffic window is ~07:00–08:00.\n- Safety analyst: crews will be in monitoring/treatment mode, not plowing. They can focus salting known slick spots roughly 03:00–06:00.\n- By 06:00–07:00, major corridors (US‑131, arterials into Rockford) should be treated and mainly damp, with localized patches still slick.\n- That implies essentially 1–4 hours of treatment lead time before the bulk of school traffic, which is ample when there’s no new falling precip.\n- For lots: district/contractor crews can spot‑treat campus areas on a similar 03:00–06:00 schedule.\n- Net: Plow/treatment timing is favorable; there’s no “still storming at 7:30 AM” scenario to overwhelm operations.\n\n4. ICE RISK – DOES IT CHANGE THE GAME?\n- There is NO modeled freezing rain or measurable new ice accretion for Jan 6 itself.\n- Ice risk is limited to:\n  • Moisture from dense freezing fog depositing on surfaces near 31–32°F.\n  • Patchy black ice on untreated surfaces, bridges, low‑lying rural stretches, and some parking lots.\n- Michigan closure thresholds treat *significant ice storms* (widespread glaze, trees/lines down, travel emergencies) as a high‑probability closure trigger; this is not that.\n- With temps marginal and salt effective near 31–32°F, and with no active precip during the commute window, this kind of patchy fog‑driven ice historically leads to: normal school with extra caution, not blanket closures.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS – DOMINO EFFECT CHECK\n- News Intel confirms:\n  • As of the evening of Jan 5, there are NO posted closures or delays for Jan 6 for Rockford or any listed neighboring districts (Cedar Springs, Sparta, Kent City, Forest Hills, Northview, Greenville, Lowell, Kenowa Hills, Grand Rapids, Kent ISD).\n  • No large event cancellations, no emergency declarations, no power‑outage clusters.\n- Community chatter is mixed: some hoping for a snow day, others openly expecting a routine winter commute. No strong, confident “everyone thinks we’re closing” signal.\n- Therefore: no +15–20% bump from neighboring closures; no +10–15% bump from overwhelming community expectation of closure.\n\n6. HOW I WEIGHTED EACH EXPERT (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35% weight):\n  • Raw forecast is very clear: 0\" snow, no ice storm, marginal temps, improving vis by bus time.\n  • This strongly pulls the base probability into the 5–15% Michigan “routine weather” band.\n- Safety (25% weight):\n  • Flags moderate *operational* risk from fog/black ice but explicitly states that a full snow day is not justified.\n  • Suggests careful driving, possible micro‑delays, but still normal operations – this keeps probability low but not zero.\n- History (20% weight):\n  • Analog patterns (fog + near‑freezing, no new snow/ice, no alerts) show roughly 5–10% historical snow‑day rates.\n  • Seasonal context: districts usually need 6–10\" snow, major ice, or extreme cold to close in early January; none apply.\n  • This firmly reinforces a sub‑15% probability.\n- News Intel (20% weight, “secret weapon”):\n  • No neighboring district closures → no upward adjustment.\n  • Sentiment is uncertain and mixed, not “this is a sure closure” or “this is nothing.” That might argue for a mild nudge above the absolute floor, but not much.\n  • A regional paywalled outlook mentions some risk along/north of I‑96; however, site‑specific data for Rockford + lack of real‑world closure signals makes that a weak up‑adjustment.\n\n7. BASELINE VS. ADJUSTED PROBABILITY\n- Start from Michigan threshold guidance:\n  • 0\" snow, no significant ice ⇒ baseline near low end of <4\" band: about 5–10%.\n- Historical analog rate: 5–10% ⇒ consistent with that baseline.\n- Safety’s “moderate” local hazard (fog/black ice) but clear “don’t cancel” guidance:\n  • Justifies being slightly above the absolute minimum, not at 1–2%.\n- News/community:\n  • No closures posted; community not strongly expecting a day off.\n  • Regional outlook hints at SOME risk; this might nudge from 8% toward ~10%.\n- I avoid the 40–60% band per instructions; the evidence simply doesn’t support high uncertainty or balanced odds.\n\nPutting all that together, I land at **10%**: low but not negligible, consistent with historical closure rates for this specific pattern.\n\n8. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Outcomes that could push the real-world decision *toward closure* and make 10% too low:\n  • Freezing fog and low‑level moisture produce far more widespread ice than modeled – many roads and lots glaze over, and even treated surfaces stay slick.\n  • Visibilities stay <1/4 mile through 7–8 AM district‑wide (not just in pockets), making safe bus operations very difficult.\n  • An unforecast band of light freezing drizzle materializes during the 4–7 AM window, adding real ice accretion on top of fog.\n  • Road commissions fall behind (staffing/equipment issues or resource misallocation), so key corridors and campus lots remain untreated by bus time.\n  • A late‑night NWS Dense Fog Advisory with widespread sub‑1/8‑mile vis triggers a conservative call by multiple superintendents, causing a regional wave of closures.\n- Outcomes that would make 10% *too high*:\n  • Fog dissipates faster than expected; by 5–6 AM vis already several miles and roads largely just wet.\n  • Road reports and early driver checks (5–6 AM) come back clean with minimal slick spots.\n\nGiven current data and Michigan norms, the balance of probabilities still favors **school in session with normal start**.\n",
