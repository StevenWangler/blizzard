    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Monday, Dec 1, the main winter storm impacts are front‑loaded to Saturday–Sunday, with the official Winter Storm Warning expiring Sunday at 10 AM. By the target school day, temperatures remain well below freezing (upper teens at the bus hour to upper 20s afternoon), but winds are light (generally 5–8 mph), and there is no significant precipitation through the morning and daytime. Roads will have 1–2 feet of snow from the weekend storm in some areas, but plows have roughly 24 hours after the warning ends to clear major routes before Monday’s commute.\n\nOn Dec 1 itself, the forecast shows dry and very cold overnight and morning hours, with only minor mist and overcast skies; visibility is generally 4–6 miles by commute time, with a short period of local fog around 3–7 AM where some spots are modeled as low as 1 mile, which is typical for post‑storm cold, humid air. The only new accumulating snow on Monday is a small burst of heavy snow after 9 PM (about 0.6 cm/0.24\" total), ending by around 11 PM; this is well after school dismissal and light by Michigan standards. No freezing rain or mixed precip is indicated Monday; everything stays solidly below freezing.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for snow and the long lead time for road crews after the weekend storm, the conditions for Monday morning point toward a normal school day: very cold, snow‑covered shoulders and side roads, but with main roads expected to be plowed and treated. There is no indication of an ice storm, no strong winds or whiteout conditions during the commute, and new snowfall on Monday is minimal and late at night. Overall, the meteorological setup does not strongly support a snow day for Monday, Dec 1."

        "Kent County and Rockford‑area road crews are accustomed to handling 6–10\" snow events; for a Monday after a weekend warning, plows are typically out repeatedly on primary roads and main bus routes.",
        "Michigan districts—including Rockford—rarely cancel for snow alone unless totals exceed roughly 8–10\" with poor timing (heavy snow during the pre‑dawn/morning commute) or conditions meet blizzard/ice‑storm criteria.",
        "Given the warning ends at 10:00 AM Sunday and Monday is quiet, there is a full day+ for cleanup of parking lots and sidewalks before Monday’s start."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s slightly higher elevation than the immediate Grand Rapids urban core can marginally increase local snow totals and drifting on open stretches, but with forecast winds under about 15 mph on Monday, drifting and whiteout conditions should be limited."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the forecast data: • The main high‑impact winter storm is confined to Saturday–Sunday (Nov 29–30), with Winter Storm Warnings calling for 7–10\"+ and the heaviest snow Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning. • By Monday, December 1, conditions moderate: temperatures are cold (teens in the early morning, upper 20s°F afternoon), winds are relatively light (generally under 10 mph), visibility improves, and new snow is very light (~0.03\" liquid / ~0.25\" additional snow, mainly late evening). • There is no indication of extreme cold (wind chills are around 10–15°F, far from the –15°F threshold where Michigan districts sometimes close), no ice storm signal (precip type is all snow/freezing mist transitioning to dry), and no blizzard‑level winds. Historically in Kent County and Rockford‑area districts, this pattern—major storm ending a full day before, followed by a cold, quieter Monday—usually leads to school being open, with perhaps localized slick spots and some delayed side‑street cleanup. Therefore, in historical terms, the probability of a full snow day on Monday, December 1 for these conditions would be relatively low. The biggest historical exception would be if actual weekend totals significantly exceed forecast (e.g., >12\" with substantial drifting) and road crews fall behind, or if a localized power‑outage problem emerges. Those are less common outcomes but can raise closure odds. Overall, this analysis carries medium confidence: the large‑scale pattern and timing are clear, but final decisions in Michigan depend heavily on real‑time road conditions on Sunday night and early Monday rather than forecast snow amounts alone."

By Monday, Dec 1, Rockford is cold but quiet: no measurable snow during the commute, light winds, improving visibility, and road crews having had a full day to clear primary routes and most secondaries. Historically, Kent County schools very rarely cancel in this pattern unless road crews are overwhelmed or an ice/blizzard component lingers into the pre-dawn hours, neither of which is indicated. The historical post-storm closure rates (0.2–0.25 at most) align with the safety assessment showing only moderate residual risk.
