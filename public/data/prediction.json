Based on the hourly data, morning wind chills look roughly near/just below 0°F to around -5°F (not in typical closure territory). The main watch item is localized low visibility overnight/early morning and any refreeze/black ice from prior moisture, which could support a delay in isolated cases, but a district-wide closure is unlikely."

      "For the 06:00–08:00 school commute, winds increase (roughly 5 mph at 06:00 to ~10 mph by 08:00 with higher gusts). This can produce blowing/drifting of any loose snow already on shoulders and may reduce comfort/safety at bus stops (wind chills near ~2°F).",

Public-facing sources I could access show mixed results: a Weather.com US canonical page shows feels-like values near +1 to +2°F during the day (aligning with your API), while a different Weather.com locale page (/en-ZW/) shows feels-like near -23°F but appears to be for earlier dates (around Jan 19–21) and therefore is likely not relevant to 2026-01-26. WeatherBug and weatherUSA pages show feels-like values well above -20°F in their displayed windows. I was unable to reliably fetch Weather.gov/NWS point-forecast and AccuWeather RealFeel for the exact 2026-01-26 period in the tool results returned here, so the NWS/AccuWeather cross-check for that specific date remains incomplete and should be re-queried closer to Sunday night (2026-01-25) or early Monday (2026-01-26).",

Safety’s “moderate” ice risk is clarified as isolated patches (5–15% of route mileage intermittent slickness), not widespread glaze.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow end time is effectively “no event.” Hours from ‘snow end’ to 7:40 AM is not limiting; major roads expected clear/salty by 6:30 AM. Neighborhood streets may remain packed/variable but generally passable.\n4) Ice? No new freezing rain/sleet indicated. Ice concern is pre-existing/spot refreeze, not systemic.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Mon 1/26 closures/delays located across key neighbors in this scan; that removes the +15–20% bump.\n6) Power: Systemwide outages are single digits; no sign of local outage-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: No credible source supports ≤ -20°F for Mon 1/26 AM; therefore no cold-trigger override.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) a late-developing lake-effect streamer depositing quick snow bursts pre-dawn, (b) widespread freezing fog/black ice forming more broadly than expected, or (c) an unexpected sharp drop in wind chill toward policy thresholds.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verification (5%) all point to a very low closure risk.

The main ways this could still become a closure are (a) an unmodeled patch of widespread black ice from prior moisture, or (b) district-specific cold exposure policy decisions.

With no new snow/ice forecast, primary and most secondary roads should remain serviceable; the main hazards are spotty refreeze/black ice (especially where moisture already exists) and reduced overnight visibility that could linger in low-lying areas. Those factors can justify increased caution or an isolated delay on specific routes, but they usually don’t support a district-wide snow day absent active precipitation, widespread glaze, or extreme wind chills. Net: low closure probability, slightly elevated above baseline due to persistent subfreezing temps and localized slick-spot risk."

For Monday, 2026-01-26, the provided forecast is “cold but dry,” and we have no authoritative closure indication from Rockford Public Schools. While there’s evidence the area has recently had impactful winter conditions (neighboring district closure on Fri 01-23-26; local media closings feed activity; earlier advisory coverage), those do not translate into a high probability of closure on a day with no snow/ice event forecast. I keep a small non-zero probability for an AM delay or a late-breaking change if black ice becomes widespread or if the cold/wind chills trend much lower than currently indicated."
