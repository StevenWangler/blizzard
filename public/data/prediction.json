Have drivers treat this as a “black-ice possible” morning even if pavement looks dry.",
      "Bus ops: run normal routes but brief drivers to reduce speed on secondary/rural roads, approach rail crossings and stop-controlled intersections with extra stopping distance, and avoid hard braking. If any route includes steep neighborhood hills, plan alternate turnarounds if a spot is glazed.",
      "Parking lots/walkways: maintenance should spot-salt bus loops, staff lots, and parent drop-off by ~6:00 AM, focusing on shaded areas and building entrances; this is where slips typically drive late starts even when roads are fine.",
      "Student walkers: remind families about icy sidewalks/driveways (many remain uncleared). Encourage traction footwear and extra time at crossings around 7:00–8:00 AM when glare ice is hardest to see.",
      "Decision guidance for the competition: In most states, “ice risk moderate + no precip” might still push delays; in Michigan this usually stays OPEN. I’d only bump toward delay/closure if evening reports tonight (Wed 2026-02-25) confirm widespread glaze or if temps briefly rise above freezing late Wed then refreeze before dawn (not shown in your Thu data).",
      "Monitor early AM real-world indicators: road commission/MDOT cams, bus-driver check-ins starting ~5:30–6:00 AM, and any spike in minor crashes/spin-outs. If multiple rural-route drivers report sliding at 6:00–6:30 AM, consider a 2-hour delay rather than a full closure."

Web cross-checking was partially successful: The Weather Network current page shows ~23°F with feels-like ~10°F (close to WeatherAPI current feels-like), supporting that conditions are cold but not extreme. However, multiple major public sites returned stale/mismatched hourly snippets (notably Weather.com) that do not align with the Feb 26 target; therefore, the web consensus for the *Feb 26 morning* feels-like could not be robustly validated from all requested sources in this run.

News intel adds one meaningful caution flag (KCRC publicly preparing for icy roads), but it does not come with confirmation of a new freezing-precip mechanism on Thursday—so the likely outcome is localized slick spots rather than widespread glaze. Infrastructure assessment supports that trunklines and primary bus-route roads should be serviceable by 6:30 AM given the long overnight treatment window, with neighborhoods the ‘last mile’ concern. Power-grid signals do not point to a closure trigger. With no neighboring weather closures and no Rockford announcement hints, the domino pressure is absent.

Patchy ice can trigger operational issues, but in this setup it’s usually managed by treatment and driver caution and more often yields spot delays rather than a full snow day.\n\nGiven peers noting “moderate” ice risk and local road-commission prep messaging, I’ll keep a small but non-trivial closure probability, while still firmly in the ‘open’ camp.",

That combination strongly argues against a district-wide closure.\n\nI’m not at 0% because today (Wed 2026-02-25) features light snow and earlier freezing rain in the hourly history, and Thursday morning temps are cold enough to refreeze any leftover melt/slush, producing patchy black ice—especially on untreated/shaded roads and bridges. Patchy ice can trigger operational issues, but in this setup it’s usually managed by treatment and driver caution and more often yields spot delays rather than a full snow day.\n\nGiven peers noting “moderate” ice risk and local road-commission prep messaging, I’ll keep a small but non-trivial closure probability, while still firmly in the ‘open’ camp."

Historically, that profile is overwhelmingly an “open” day. The only plausible closure pathway is widespread black ice from Wed’s wintry mix/light snow and any treatment-related melt/refreeze overnight. In this region, that scenario typically produces isolated slick spots and at most a 1–2 hour delay rather than a full closure. I therefore place full snow-day probability in the low single digits."

The only credible safety-driven disruption mechanism is a dawn refreeze/black-ice window (roughly 5:30–9:00 AM) if there is leftover wetness/slush from Wednesday’s system. That scenario can produce localized sliding incidents and bus-route issues on secondary roads, but it usually results in targeted cautions or a short delay rather than a district-wide closure—especially with road commission pretreatment/treatment planned. Net: low single-digit closure odds; I place it at 6% to account for the ‘ice wildcard’ and real-world condition uncertainty overnight."

For Thu 2026-02-26, there’s no accumulating precip forecast and Rockford Public Schools hasn’t signaled a closure/delay yet, which strongly biases toward open. The only meaningful closure pathway I see is *residual/refreeze ice* from Wed’s wintry mix combined with untreated secondary roads and early bus-route timing; the road commission’s messaging supports that risk. But because KCRC is explicitly preparing (pretreat/treatment operations early Thu), and because the Thu forecast itself is dry with improving daytime temps (mid-30s), my best estimate is a low single-digit chance of a full snow day, with a somewhat higher chance of a 2-hour delay (not asked, but relevant context)."
