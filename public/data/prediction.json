Wind chills during bus time are in the upper 20s (about 27–29°F), far from cold-closure thresholds. Given Michigan’s winter capability and no accumulating snow/ice signal, the snow-day/closure probability is very low (~0–5%); at most, watch for localized minor flooding/standing water in poor-drainage spots and slower bus operations."

Weather.com’s hourly display for early Wed (12–5 AM) shows temps ~42°F with ‘feels like’ mid-30s, broadly consistent with a mild/wet setup and nowhere near extreme cold. Timeanddate’s day summary for Wed Feb 18 is even warmer (55/38°F), reinforcing the ‘mild + rain’ storyline. No checked public source showed sub -20°F wind chills. The main operational risk for a closure here is not cold; it’s potential slick spots if precipitation overlaps near-freezing surfaces (a small temp error could flip rain to freezing rain), plus reduced visibility/fog and wet roads. Also note WeatherAPI has an NWS Grand Rapids Hydrologic Outlook (river rises/ice jam potential), which typically does not drive same-day school closures but indicates broader melt/rain impacts.",

The only credible pathway to disruption is a narrow-margin surface-temperature issue: if bridge decks/untreated elevated surfaces briefly reach ~32°F while rain is occurring (or immediately after), isolated glazing/black-ice spots could appear, especially on rural routes and overpasses. That scenario historically drives targeted spot-treating and sometimes a 2-hour delay, but it rarely produces a district-wide closure without a clear freezing-rain headline or widespread subfreezing conditions.\n\nThere are no “domino effect” signals: the latest available checks show no active closings/delays on FOX17, no Rockford announcement, and no neighboring-district postings. Infrastructure capability is normal/ready (spot-treatment likely if needed), and power-grid status is stable (Kent County ~0% out). Given the strong consensus (agents within ~2% spread) and the lack of leading closure indicators, the Brier-score-optimized call is a low single-digit-to-high single-digit closure probability.\n\nRecommendation: **Open with monitoring** (not a snow day).

          "desc": "ESFGRR\n\nSteady melting of snow and ice over the last week has begun to cause\nrivers to rise across the area. Several chances for rain this week\nwill add to these rises. Based on current expected rainfall, no\nsignificant flooding is expected on West Michigan rivers, though\ntypical spring water level rises within the river channels will\nhappen.\n\nMeanwhile, river ice has weakened significantly over the last week,\nand as water levels rise any remaining ice will likely be broken and\nstart to move downstream. This creates the possibility for formation\nof a few ice jams. Ice jams tend to form in the same places\nrepeatedly, so special attention should be paid in the Comstock Park\n(Kent County) area as well as the Robinson Township (Ottawa County)\narea along the Grand River.\n\nAnyone living or working near West Michigan rivers should pay extra\nattention this week as water levels rise. Have a plan to monitor and\nrespond if flooding develops unexpectedly.\n\nMonitor the latest conditions at https://water.noaa.gov\n",
