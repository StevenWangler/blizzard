      "Secondary and rural roads are the swing factor: low traffic + leftover glaze from 2/11 could leave patchy slick spots at stop signs and on gravel/edge-of-pavement areas, especially pre-dawn.",
      "Parking lots/walkways: expect the usual trouble spots—compacted snow/ice from prior days, plus refreeze in low spots. This is more of a slip/fall risk than a bus-route shutdown risk.",

However, the web cross-check did NOT return reliable, date-matching hourly data: Weather.com results for Rockford, MI appear stale/cached and show mismatched dates; WeatherUSA also appears stale and mentions alerts that may not apply to Feb 12. Because I could not retrieve authoritative NWS (weather.gov) or AccuWeather 'RealFeel' values specific to Thu Feb 12, 2026 from the tool’s web results, web-based confirmation is inconclusive. Based on the only date-specific dataset (your Weather API feed), no extreme cold trigger is present and snow/ice impacts look minimal, suggesting a low snow-day/closure risk for Thu 2026-02-12.",

Follow-up meteorology supports treating “0 mi” as likely overdone/rounded and, if fog occurs, more **patchy** (river/low spots) than a countywide shutdown scenario. \n\nNews intelligence did not find confirmed neighboring-district closures/delays on the main closings feed, and RPS did not post a Thu 2/12 weather decision in accessible site sections—both signals lean strongly away from a full closure. Infrastructure and power-grid inputs show no plow catch-up need and no major outage driver. \n\nTherefore: **low probability of a full snow day (closure)**, with the more realistic operational outcome being **OPEN**, and a smaller but real chance of a **2-hour delay** if dense fog (<1/4 mile) and slick secondary roads are confirmed on the ground right before bus dispatch.",

I’m nudging that baseline upward because the prior day’s light freezing rain signal creates a realistic next-morning slick-spot risk (especially on lower-priority roads), and the dataset shows extremely low visibility overnight/early morning consistent with fog/freezing fog.

That setup almost always means school is open in West Michigan. The only plausible pathway to a closure is a *non-snow* hazard: dense fog/freezing fog producing near-zero visibility during the 6–8 AM window, potentially combined with patchy refreeze/black ice from Wednesday’s light freezing rain. That combination is uncommon but not impossible; it’s enough to keep the probability above ‘near-zero,’ but still low overall."

        "shiftReason": "Historically, a dry, light-wind winter day in Rockford (even with teens/20s at the bus window) rarely produces a full closure. Given the Thu 2026-02-12 forecast is essentially ‘quiet’ (no accumulating snow/ice), the baseline closure rate is very low (~a few percent). I’m nudging that baseline upward because the prior day’s light freezing rain signal creates a realistic next-morning slick-spot risk (especially on lower-priority roads), and the dataset shows extremely low visibility overnight/early morning consistent with fog/freezing fog. Still, absent new precip or strong winds, the most common operational outcome is open (possibly with a delay if dense fog and patchy ice are observed on routes). Net: low but non-zero closure probability."

The Thu 2026-02-12 forecast itself is dry with light wind—normally an easy ‘open’ call. However, the combination of (a) a prior-day freezing rain signal (Wed 2026-02-11) and (b) very low modeled visibility in the pre-dawn/morning window creates a non-zero closure risk via black ice + near-zero visibility on secondary roads. Still, absent ongoing precip, most districts in this area can mitigate with treatment and slower operations; that makes a full snow day unlikely. I land at ~9% for a closure, with a higher likelihood of a 1–2 hour delay if fog verifies."

I’m keeping probability non-trivial because multiple hours indicate near-zero visibility and freezing fog potential—conditions that can prompt *morning delays* for bus safety even when roads are mostly clear. Net: low likelihood of a full closure, small-but-real chance of a delay; overall snow-day probability ~8%."
