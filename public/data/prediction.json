Winds are moderate (generally W/WNW 10–15 mph, gusts near 15–19 mph), enough to produce notable wind chills but not enough for significant blowing/drifting given minimal new snow. Visibility is generally good (around 4–6 mi average), though there are a couple late-evening hours showing 1 mi or lower visibility which suggests patchy fog/low stratus rather than snow. Net: a low probability of a full snow day from new snow on Wednesday, but a non-trivial risk of delays or localized issues due to lingering ice and very cold temperatures preventing melt/cleanup."

This is unresolved because authoritative NWS hourly wind chill could not be fetched in-tool.\n3) Plow timing math: Infrastructure expectation is trunklines/arterials driveable by ~06:30, county connectors passable but slick, and local streets can remain packed/glazed until 08:00–11:00. That supports ‘open or delay’ more than closure.\n4) Ice: Yes—moderate refreeze/black-ice risk is the primary pathway to disruption.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed closures/delays found on official web surfaces during the latest scan.\n6) Power: Outages appear extremely limited statewide (~0.01%); not a closure driver.\n7) Wind chill verification: Not confirmed by multiple sources here; only a conflicting Weather.com snapshot suggests ≤ -20°F, so I cannot apply the near-automatic closure rule with high confidence.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) wind chills truly ≤ -20°F for several hours at bus-stop time (many districts close for that alone), or (b) Tuesday’s icing was more widespread than assumed, leaving systemic traction failure on many bus routes early Wednesday.\n\nWeighting the experts per directive: Meteorology (25%) + Safety (25%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (5%) + Web verifier (5%). Baseline from the consensus debate is ~12%.\n- I keep the base low because there’s near-zero new snow and no confirmed domino closures.\n- I bump modestly upward (+3%) due to the unresolved wind-chill discrepancy and infrastructure’s note that local streets may remain snow-covered/icy into mid-morning.\n\nFinal: 15% chance of a full snow day (closure).

The credible closure pathway is widespread icy travel from Tuesday’s freezing rain/snow persisting into Wednesday morning because temperatures stay below freezing all day.

Given the forecasted lack of new snow, moderate winds, and wind chills that (per the provided WeatherAPI feed) do not clearly reach typical “automatic closure” territory, I land in the low-teens for a full snow day.

The provided forecast supports only *patchy* slickness risk: cold temps prevent melt and allow refreeze, but winds/precip are too light to create rapidly deteriorating travel. That combination usually leads to cautious operations (slower buses, spot delays) rather than a full closure, unless real-world road reports early Wednesday show widespread glaze or multiple crashes.

The weather forecast for Wed 01/28 itself is a cold, mostly dry day with minimal snow, so the best pathway to a snow day is lingering ice/packed snow from Tuesday causing widespread bus-route hazards at daybreak.

The forecast does not show accumulating snow or strong winds during the morning commute, which are the dominant weather drivers for full closures. The credible closure pathway is widespread icy travel from Tuesday’s freezing rain/snow persisting into Wednesday morning because temperatures stay below freezing all day. That scenario is real, but it depends heavily on treatment/cleanup effectiveness and how much ice actually formed—so I keep the *snow day* probability low but non-zero (more supportive of a delay than a closure)."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical/behavioral standpoint, Wednesday 2026-01-28 resembles a common post-event ‘cleanup day’: the impactful weather is Tuesday 1/27, while Wednesday is cold/overcast with minimal additional precip. In comparable situations, full closures are uncommon; the main closure mechanism would be widespread lingering ice on untreated roads after a freezing-rain/snow combo. Given the forecasted lack of new snow, moderate winds, and wind chills that (per the provided WeatherAPI feed) do not clearly reach typical “automatic closure” territory, I land in the low-teens for a full snow day. I’d expect “school on” with an elevated chance of a 2-hour delay if Tuesday’s ice compacts and refreezes on rural/secondary routes overnight."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Wednesday (2026-01-28) looks like a *cleanup/refreeze* morning rather than an active storm day. With essentially no new snow during the 6–9 AM window, the primary driver for a snow day would be widespread untreated ice remaining from Tuesday’s event. The provided forecast supports only *patchy* slickness risk: cold temps prevent melt and allow refreeze, but winds/precip are too light to create rapidly deteriorating travel. That combination usually leads to cautious operations (slower buses, spot delays) rather than a full closure, unless real-world road reports early Wednesday show widespread glaze or multiple crashes. I therefore keep snow-day probability low but non-zero to reflect the residual-ice uncertainty after Tuesday’s freezing rain/advisory conditions."

Right now the decision signals point toward normal operations: no posted RPS closure/delay as of Tuesday morning, and no “domino” pattern in neighboring districts. The weather forecast for Wed 01/28 itself is a cold, mostly dry day with minimal snow, so the best pathway to a snow day is lingering ice/packed snow from Tuesday causing widespread bus-route hazards at daybreak. That scenario is plausible but typically produces *delays* more than full closure. I therefore place full snow-day probability in the low teens."
