In Michigan, that combination more often produces a *delay* than a closure unless there are widespread verified slick-road reports.

The only operational hazard is overnight fog/mist with temps in the mid-20s, which can create localized black ice and reduced visibility—more consistent with minor slowdowns or a possible delay if early route checks verify widespread slick spots, not a full cancellation.

        "shiftReason": "From a safety perspective, the hazard tomorrow (Mon, 2026-02-16) is not snow accumulation but a combo of (a) subfreezing morning temps and (b) high humidity/fog/mist that can leave thin glaze/black-ice patches on untreated surfaces plus reduced visibility for buses. That profile can produce isolated slide-offs, but because impacts are usually localized (bridges/valleys/backroads) and treatable with targeted salting + adjusted driving, it rarely justifies a district-wide closure in West Michigan. I’d place full snow-day/closure risk at ~3%, with a higher chance of a *delay* than a closure if morning visibility verifies worse than forecast and crews observe multiple slick spots early."

So the probability of a *weather-driven* snow day for RPS is effectively moot. Interpreting the prompt as “if school were scheduled, would news/conditions point to a closure?”, I still land very low because the forecast shows no accumulating snow/precip and no alerts—just fog/mist and potential patchy slick spots.\n\nGiven that fog + subfreezing temps can occasionally trigger a 2-hour delay if there are verified slick-road reports early Monday, I keep a small residual closure probability (2%) to account for an unforecast flash-freeze or a morning crash cluster that forces an emergency call. But absent a specific advisory/watch/warning and absent accumulating snow/ice, there’s no strong news signal supporting a closure."
