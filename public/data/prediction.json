    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Wednesday, 2025-12-03, this looks like a **cold, overcast but dry** school day with **no significant snow or ice impacts**.\n\n• **Temps:** Overnight lows in the mid-20s °F, morning bus time (6–8 AM) around 24°F, afternoon highs near 32–33°F. Wind chills in the low teens during the early morning due to 13–18 mph SSW winds, but still typical early December cold for West Michigan.\n\n• **Precipitation:** Forecast shows **0.0\" snow, 0.00\" liquid precip** all day, and **0% chance of snow or rain** hour-by-hour. There is no indication of freezing rain, drizzle, or new accumulation during the school window.\n\n• **Road/ice risk:** Some **patchy slick spots** are possible from prior light snow/freezing drizzle on Tuesday, but with no new precip, road crews and normal traffic should manage this easily. Temperatures hover near/below freezing but not in combination with ongoing precipitation—so no classic ice-storm setup.\n\n• **Wind:** Gusts up to 24–25 mph midday; this is breezy and will make recess/bus stops feel colder, but not damaging or hazardous by Michigan standards.\n\n• **Visibility:** Generally 1–6 miles under overcast skies with occasional mist/fog; no heavy snow or dense fog episode that would seriously impede travel.\n\n**Snow day likelihood for Wednesday, 2025-12-03 in Rockford, MI: Extremely low.**\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather, the lack of accumulating snow or ice, and only routine cold/wind, conditions strongly favor **schools operating on a normal schedule** with, at most, minor caution for some leftover slick spots early in the morning."

Historically, Rockford and similar West Michigan districts almost always hold school under these conditions, even with some residual slick spots from the prior day. The pattern does not approach common closure triggers such as 8–10\"+ of snow with poor timing, a blizzard, an ice storm, or extreme wind chills below about ‑15°F. Consequently, the historical analogue rate of snow days for a day like this is very low (on the order of a few percent or less), and the expectation—using past patterns rather than an official decision—is that a snow day on 2025‑12‑03 is unlikely."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Cold, overcast, essentially dry day with no accumulating snow/ice and typical early‑December wind/chill; explicitly labels snow day likelihood as extremely low.\n- Historian: Finds multiple strong analogs where school almost always operates; historical snow day rates 1–5% for this setup; emphasizes that none of Michigan’s usual closure triggers (8–10\"+ snow, blizzard, ice storm, sub‑‑15°F wind chills) are present.\n- Safety analyst: Road and travel risk rated low; primary/secondary roads 8–9/10, parking lots 8/10, walking 7/10, driving 8/10. Recommends a normal on‑time start with standard winter caution.\n- News intel: No Rockford or neighboring‑district closures posted as of late Dec 2; no major storm/emergency advisories; community tone is cautious but not ‘this will definitely cancel school’.\nAll four lines of evidence point in the same direction: conditions are wintery but routine, and schools are expected to operate normally. There are no substantive conflicts among the experts.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Prior light snow/freezing drizzle was on Tuesday. By the Wednesday morning bus window (≈6–8 AM 2025‑12‑03), plows and salt trucks will have had 12+ hours to work.\n- With no new precip and temps in the mid‑20s°F, main routes remain in good shape; any residual slick spots are on untreated/rural roads, bridges, and shaded curves only.\n- From the standpoint of ‘hours from snow end to 7:40 AM’, the gap is well above the typical 6–8 hour minimum where Michigan districts expect crews to catch up. This strongly favors opening.\n\n3. Ice considerations\n- Forecast precipitation: 0.00\" overnight and during school; snow probability 0% overnight and in the morning.\n- Temperatures stay below freezing until close to midday, so any leftover moisture can refreeze and create patchy black ice, but this is residual, localized risk—not an active ice event.\n- Safety analyst labels ice risk as moderate only in the sense of possible refreeze in spots, not widespread glaze.\n- Because there is *no* new freezing rain or mixed precip, we are far from an ‘ice changes everything’ scenario.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and news intelligence\n- News intel explicitly reports: no confirmed closure announcements yet for Rockford, Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, or Kent ISD as of late Dec 2.\n- Regional closings lists do not show a domino‑effect wave of pre‑emptive closures for Dec 3; superintendents are clearly treating this as a routine winter day where final checks occur in the 4–6 AM window.\n- There is no regional travel advisory or state/county emergency that would pressure coordinated closures.\nAccording to the decision rules, 3+ neighboring districts closing would add +15–20 percentage points, but that trigger is clearly not met.\n\n5. Quantitative synthesis and weighting\nUsing the assigned weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): With 0\" new snow/ice and routine cold, a reasonable meteorological‑only closure probability is ~2–3%. Weighting: 0.35 × 3 ≈ 1.1.\n- Safety (25% weight): Low risk scores, explicit recommendation for normal start; estimate ~2–4% closure probability from a pure safety operations perspective. Weighting: 0.25 × 3 ≈ 0.8.\n- History (20% weight): Analog rates run 1–5%, central tendency ~3%. Weighting: 0.20 × 3 ≈ 0.6.\n- News intelligence (20% weight): No closures posted and community is not strongly expecting a snow day; this leans even *lower* than the others, roughly ~1–3%. Weighting: 0.20 × 2 ≈ 0.4.\nBase combined estimate ≈ 1.1 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.4 ≈ 2.9%. Given Michigan’s high tolerance and the absence of any strong contradicting signal, rounding slightly upward to incorporate residual ‘lake‑effect surprise’ risk yields about 5%.\n\n6. Why 5% and a ‘high’ confidence level?\n- 5% falls inside the Michigan guideline for low‑impact events: <4\" snow or, here, *no* new snow/ice → 5–15% baseline. With no active storm and no ice, the lower bound of that range is appropriate.\n- All four expert domains are aligned; there are no conflicting analyses that would justify a mid‑range (40–60%) or even moderate (20–30%) probability.\n- The main way to be wrong is an unexpectedly intense, localized lake‑effect band forming overnight directly over Rockford that (a) produces several inches of surprise accumulation right before the commute and (b) overwhelms plows between ~3–7 AM. While theoretically possible, that scenario is explicitly not supported by the current data.\nGiven the strong agreement and the lack of systemic red flags, confidence in a very low snow‑day probability is high.\n\nConclusion: The coordinated, weighted assessment points to a snow day probability of about 5%—schools should plan for a normal, on‑time schedule with standard winter precautions and an early‑morning conditions check.",
