Winds NW/WNW 10–18 mph keep wind chills in the -15 to -25°F range during school commute hours, supported by an active Cold Weather Advisory.

Given Michigan’s typical closure behavior (rarely closing for snow amount alone, more likely for ice/blizzard/extreme cold), this setup modestly increases the chance of a delay or selective closure (especially for districts with extensive bus exposure), but it is not the classic high-probability snow-day pattern.

Meteorologist reconciled this as a low (10–15%) chance of measurable snow for Rockford, most likely trace–0.2\".\n3) Plow timing math: Thurs advisory impacts through ~7:00 PM; from 7:00 PM to 7:40 AM is ~12h 40m of cleanup time—favorable for primaries and many secondaries. Remaining risk is spot ice/polished intersections, not widespread impassability.\n4) Any ice?: Yes—ice formation/refreeze risk is HIGH (black ice from residual moisture + reduced salt effectiveness). However, it is expected to be patchy rather than a widespread glaze event.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed closures/delays found for Rockford or nearby districts in the latest news-intel check, so no +15–20% neighbor adjustment.\n6) What would make me wrong?: (a) a lake-effect band sets up over inland Kent County during 5–9 AM producing quick 1–3\" and reduced visibility, (b) a flash-freeze leaves widespread untreated-road icing beyond “spot” levels, or (c) Rockford/area districts apply a strict wind-chill closure threshold (e.g., closing near/at -20°F) and decide proactively.\n\nWeighting the four inputs per system guidance: Meteorology (30%) strongly argues against a snow-day due to near-zero accumulation and limited commute fog risk, but flags extreme wind chills. Safety (20%) raises operational risk (refreeze + exposure), but also notes the long cleanup window makes full closure less likely than delay. History (15%) supports meaningful—but not dominant—cold-driven closure odds; however, the safety analyst’s regional rule-of-thumb suggests full closures in this setup are typically in the ~5–15% range. News intelligence (15%) finds no closure signals and confirms NWS products mention snow showers, but without a closure domino pattern.\n\nGiven Michigan thresholds: this is <4\" new snow (effectively ~0\"), so the snow-amount-based baseline is very low. Wind chill in the -15°F to -25°F range raises concern, but cold alone in West Michigan more often yields delays than closures unless wind chills are persistently ≤ -20°F at pickup times district-wide.
