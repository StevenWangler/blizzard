    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan, this event is a classic marginal, messy west-Michigan setup rather than a high-confidence snow day scenario. Air temps hover near 28–31°F through tonight and Friday morning, remaining below freezing but fairly steady. Earlier in the day and early evening featured light snow and periods of light freezing rain/drizzle with gusty WNW winds, creating slick spots, especially on untreated roads and elevated surfaces. Guidance for the late-night and Friday school window (roughly 4–8 AM Friday) shows: (1) no significant new precipitation—snow chances quickly drop toward zero after midnight; (2) continued sub-freezing temperatures in the upper 20s, allowing any moisture on roads and sidewalks to refreeze; and (3) a marked decrease in wind speeds, reducing blowing/drifting issues. Visibility improves to generally 6+ miles overnight and into the morning as bands weaken and end.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for winter weather and the light additional snow amounts (about 1\" more at most, with much of that done by late evening and no accumulating snow during the core commute hours), conditions are more consistent with localized slick spots and slower travel than a widespread closure-level event. The main concern for schools Friday morning will be patches of black ice and leftover slickness from earlier freezing rain/snow, not ongoing heavy precip or poor visibility. Overall, this setup favors normal school operations with possible minor delays or isolated transportation issues rather than a broad snow day closure."

      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s modestly higher elevation than the immediate Grand River valley can enhance local snow and drifting in strong northwest flow, but with low liquid equivalent and limited total snow output in this event, drifting is expected to be minor and not at the level that typically drives system-wide closures."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Given the forecast details for November 27–28, 2025, this setup strongly resembles a typical early-season advisory event in West Michigan rather than a major closure producer. Additional accumulations are light (1–3\" potential, much of that west and north of Rockford), winds—though gusty—are below damaging thresholds for most structures and are already trending down by school-commute windows, and wind chills remain in the teens rather than dropping into the extreme cold closure range. Historically, Rockford-area schools almost always operate normally under similar late-November patterns: roads can be slick at times, especially early on bridges and rural routes, but conditions improve with salting and plowing, and visibility is not persistently at whiteout levels. Overall, the historical analogs point to a relatively low probability of a snow day being triggered by these conditions alone, with the main concern being localized, short-lived travel issues rather than system-wide inoperability."

    "decision_rationale": "Synthesis of meteorological, historical, and safety analyses strongly favors school being open.\n\nMeteorology: The event is winding down by the critical school decision window. Forecast shows low additional QPF and snow probabilities dropping to near zero after midnight. Total additional snowfall is around 1\", with peak rates only about 0.5\"/hr and mainly earlier. Winds have been gusty but are trending downward into the morning, and visibility recovers to 6+ miles. This eliminates two of the big closure drivers: ongoing heavy precip and sustained poor visibility.\n\nImpacts: The main issue is refreeze/black ice due to 24+ hours below freezing and leftover moisture from earlier snow/freezing drizzle. That creates localized slick spots, especially on untreated secondary roads, hills, curves, and elevated surfaces (bridges/overpasses, parking lots). However, primary routes are expected to be plowed and salted before the commute, and there is no indication of crews being overwhelmed by rate or volume.\n\nHistory: The closest analog patterns—light advisory-level lake-effect/clipper events with temps near 30°F and 1–3\" total—produce snow days on the order of 5–15% in this region. Additional seasonal/context adjustment is downward, since Rockford is used to exactly this setup and typically runs on time. None of the usual high-probability closure conditions (widespread 8\"+, whiteout/blizzard, or dangerous cold) are present.\n\nSafety: The safety assessment notes moderate risk, but explicitly frames this as a delay/extra caution scenario unless unexpected ongoing freezing drizzle or new snow bursts persist right at commute time. Emergency access concerns are low, and there is no indication that major arterial routes will be impassable.\n\nBalancing these factors, the most probable outcome is a normal school day with cautious driving and extra salting, possibly with isolated districts or rural routes seeing minor adjustments. That aligns with a low but nonzero closure probability. Given Michigan-specific thresholds and historical rates, a 14% snow day probability is appropriate and decisively outside the 40–60% indecision range.",
