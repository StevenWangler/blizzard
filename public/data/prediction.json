    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Wednesday 2026-01-21, this forecast strongly favors a high-impact snow day scenario primarily due to timing and intensity: accumulating snow begins around 3 AM and becomes heavy through the core commute window (roughly 6–10 AM), with totals near ~8 inches (20.46 cm) for the day. Temperatures stay solidly below freezing (mid-teens to upper-20s F), so untreated roads remain snow-covered and traction stays poor; no meaningful melt is expected. Winds are not extreme, but sustained west/southwest winds 10–17 mph with gusts near/above 20 mph can still create localized blowing and drifting, especially in open rural stretches, compounding visibility reductions. Visibility intermittently drops to ~1 mile during heavier bands, which is enough (combined with fresh morning accumulation) to slow plowing progress and increase crash risk. Because the heaviest snow is occurring during/just before school start rather than ending before ~4 AM, plow-clearing time is limited. Net: elevated likelihood of delayed start or closure depending on how quickly the heavier morning band tapers and how aggressive local road crews are."

Michigan districts often avoid closing for amounts alone, but the commute timing plus several hours of heavy snow meaningfully raises closure risk. This setup more often produces a delay than a full closure unless snowfall rates are very high right at decision time (roughly 5–7 AM) or visibility drops to near-whiteout during bus runs. Confidence is medium because small shifts in banding/timing can change the outcome from “delay” to “open” or “close.”"

Catch-up time before buses (~06:30–07:15) is effectively zero; before 7:40 AM is also effectively zero.\n\n4) Any ice?\n- No freezing rain expected Wednesday morning per meteorologist; safety analyst clarifies “moderate” ice risk is from compaction/polishing and possible refreeze, not glaze ice.\n\n5) Neighboring districts?\n- Not confirmed closed/delayed on the surfaced official pages (Rockford, GRPS, Northview, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Greenville). Therefore, I did NOT apply a domino-closure adjustment.\n\n6) What would make me wrong?\n- WRONG-HIGH scenario: If snow rates/visibility are better than forecast at 6–8 AM (e.g., main band arrives later), districts may run a 2-hour delay or even open.\n- WRONG-LOW scenario: If mesoscale banding boosts totals into the 10–12+ inch range OR visibility drops toward near-whiteout on secondary roads during bus runs, a closure becomes more likely than my current probability.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive: Met 35%, Safety 25%, History 20%, News 20%):\n- Meteorology (35%): 8.1\" with peak ~1.46\"/hr near 8 AM and vis ~1 mi during 6–9 AM strongly supports closure/delay. → high closure pressure.\n- Safety (25%): Severe commute impact, near-zero plow catch-up, secondaries very poor. → high closure pressure.\n- History (20%): For Kent County, this often becomes a 2-hour delay rather than full closure absent ice/blizzard; closure frequency ~15–25% in analogs, but higher when heavy snow persists at decision time (which it does here). → moderates upward but keeps closure from being “slam dunk.”\n- News intel (20%): Strong hazardous-travel context and closure-leaning chatter, but no verified neighboring closures/official postings yet → slight upward nudge, not a full domino bump.\n\nFINAL: Given the peak intensity overlapping buses with essentially no plow catch-up time, I put **closure** slightly more likely than not for Rockford, but with meaningful chance of a **2-hour delay** if roads are marginally passable on primaries and visibility holds closer to ~1 mi (not near-whiteout).",
