    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Monday 2026-02-02, the primary school-travel concern is a narrow pre-dawn window of light freezing rain around 5–6 AM while temperatures are in the mid-teens (F), which can create patchy glaze/black ice on untreated roads, bridges, and parking lots. This is not a snow-plow problem (no meaningful snow is forecast), but it is a salting/traction problem. Winds are modest (generally 8–11 mph), so blowing/drifting snow is not a factor and wind chills (roughly +5°F to +10°F at bus times) are cold but well above Michigan’s high-risk closure thresholds (≤ -20°F). Visibility briefly drops to ~1 mile near 6 AM, then improves to ~3–6 miles after 7 AM. Net: a DELAY is more plausible than a full closure if the freezing rain verifies during the 5–6 AM commute window; otherwise schools likely run normally.\n\nMichigan decision calibration (Rockford area):\n- Snow amount: ~0\" (not a closure driver in Michigan).\n- Ice risk: Light freezing rain 5–6 AM is the key risk; even a very thin glaze can force delays, especially on backroads.\n- Timing: Worst window overlaps bus/commute prep (5–7 AM). If freezing rain ends by ~6:30–7:00 AM, districts often mitigate with salting + cautious routing.\n- Plow hours: Not applicable (no snow accumulation expected).\n\nOperational call (my best estimate):\n- Probability of FULL closure: ~15–25% (would require more widespread icing than “light” suggests).\n- Probability of 1–2 hour DELAY: ~35–50% (most likely outcome if the 5–6 AM freezing rain occurs as forecast).\n- Probability of NORMAL schedule: ~30–45% (if freezing rain is very spotty/brief, or temps/roads stay dry enough).\n\nWhat to watch before 5 AM:\n- If radar/observations show freezing rain is steady (not intermittent) AND treated roads still glaze, delay odds jump quickly.\n- If temps trend upward faster than forecast or precip is minimal, delay odds drop."

Calibrated snow-day/closure probability for Rockford-area conditions like this is roughly **15–30%**, with the midpoint near **22%**.

      "MDOT/county crews can keep major roads mostly passable, but school bus safety is driven by the *worst secondary/rural segments*: expect slick spots on lower-volume roads, subdivision streets, and any gravel/low-priority routes until after sunrise.",
      "Decision timing: worst window overlaps with buses rolling (roughly 6:30–7:30 AM). If freezing rain is actively occurring at 6 AM, districts often choose a delay or closure because treatment can’t fully “catch up” while ice is still accreting.",
      "If the freezing rain ends near 6 AM as indicated and precip is minimal, improvement by 7:30–8:30 AM is plausible on treated routes; however, patchy black ice risk remains through mid-morning because temps stay well below 32°F all day.",
      "Visibility also dips to ~1 mile around 6 AM, which adds risk for stops, loading/unloading, and reduced sight distance near intersections and on two-lane roads.",
      "Walking students: wind chills in the single digits above 0°F are uncomfortable but not an automatic closure trigger; the bigger issue is icy sidewalks/driveways and slippery curb ramps near crossings.",
      "Parking lots/sidewalks at schools may be among the last areas treated; even if roads are OK, slip/fall risk for students/staff is elevated at arrival time.",
      "Operational mitigations (if open): run buses slower with wider following distance; avoid hard braking; consider temporary route adjustments to avoid steep hills/bridges; increase spacing at stops; and allow extra loading time.",
      "Trigger points that would push toward a snow day (even in Michigan): any report of measurable ice accretion (even a light glaze) on untreated roads, multiple slide-offs before 6 AM, or persistent freezing rain beyond ~6:30–7:00 AM.",
      "Given Michigan’s higher tolerance for snow but low tolerance for ice, this setup is a *borderline* call that often lands on a **2-hour delay** if freezing rain is ongoing at dispatch time; if the freezing rain is lighter/shorter than forecast and roads are pre-treated effectively, schools can remain open."

Because at least one credible Weather.com page shows wind chill colder than -20°F, it triggers the automatic-closure threshold flag, but the conflicting Weather.com pages strongly suggest a date/location/context mismatch in what those pages are displaying (some appear to be for a different day/time or not your target Monday).

    "decision_rationale": "Across meteorology, safety, and history, the core agreement is that Monday is a *brief freezing-rain glaze risk* morning—not a snowstorm. The highest-risk window (roughly 5–7 AM) overlaps school dispatch and bus routes, and at mid-teen temperatures salt can be slower to work on low-volume roads/parking lots, so a delay is plausibly the most common operational response.\n\nWhere there was a conflict: the web verification initially flagged ≤ -20°F wind chill from a Weather.com page. A cross-check indicates that extreme “Feels Like -26°F” appears to be a wrong-location/wrong-date context (including a Rockford, IL page), and additional hourly sources align much closer to the provided WeatherAPI feed (single digits above 0°F wind chills, not extreme). With the extreme-cold trigger removed, there is no automatic-closure driver.\n\nNews intelligence also matters here: there are no confirmed neighboring district closures yet and no Rockford Public Schools closure/delay post visible in the latest pulls—typical for an overnight icing event where districts often decide very early based on road checks. Power grid conditions are calm (statewide outages extremely low), so there’s no infrastructure forcing function to close.\n\nNet: A *district-wide* closure is plausible but not the base case; it would require freezing rain to be steadier/longer than forecast and to create widespread slickness on secondary roads and school lots during the 6–7:30 AM window. The more likely outcome is a 1–2 hour delay or opening with caution if pretreatment is effective and the freezing rain ends on time. To optimize Brier score in a Michigan context (high tolerance for winter, low tolerance for ice), the most defensible full-closure probability remains in the low-to-mid 20s.",

Even very small accretion can create disproportionate travel hazard (bridges, ramps, untreated neighborhood streets). However, the modeled/forecast precipitation amounts are extremely small, and winds are not high—both of which argue against a widespread, district-wide shutdown.\n\nI’m higher than a ‘routine winter day’ because the hazard aligns with the decision window and because at ~15°F salt effectiveness is reduced (slower to improve), increasing the chance that slick spots are still present at bus time. Still, the most likely operational outcome meteorologically is **a delay** rather than a full closure, with “normal schedule” also plausible if precip is spotty/ends early or roads were pre-treated.\n\n**My internal split (for clarity):**\n- Full closure: ~22%\n- 1–2 hour delay: ~45%\n- Normal schedule: ~33%",

That normally keeps closure odds from going high.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable pushing the probability down into the teens because the forecasted hazard type (pre-dawn **freezing rain**) is exactly the kind of event where districts can decide late (5–6 AM) and where even a trace glaze can quickly produce bus safety issues—especially if secondary roads or parking lots are slick.

The forecast shows a narrow pre-dawn window of **light freezing rain** centered roughly 5–6 AM with temperatures in the mid-teens (F). Even very small accretion can create disproportionate travel hazard (bridges, ramps, untreated neighborhood streets). However, the modeled/forecast precipitation amounts are extremely small, and winds are not high—both of which argue against a widespread, district-wide shutdown.\n\nI’m higher than a ‘routine winter day’ because the hazard aligns with the decision window and because at ~15°F salt effectiveness is reduced (slower to improve), increasing the chance that slick spots are still present at bus time. Still, the most likely operational outcome meteorologically is **a delay** rather than a full closure, with “normal schedule” also plausible if precip is spotty/ends early or roads were pre-treated.\n\n**My internal split (for clarity):**\n- Full closure: ~22%\n- 1–2 hour delay: ~45%\n- Normal schedule: ~33%"

In comparable past setups, full closures happen but are not the modal outcome; the modal outcome is a 1–2 hour delay or normal schedule depending on whether road treatment is effective and whether icing is observed on secondary/bus-route roads at ~5:30–7:00 AM. Calibrating to those analogs, I hold **~22%** for a full snow day/closure (with higher odds for a delay)."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/operations standpoint, this looks like a *borderline ice morning* rather than a snow event for Rockford, MI on Monday 2026-02-02. The forecasted QPF is tiny (~0.11 mm total) but occurs as freezing rain around 5–6 AM while temperatures remain well below freezing all day, meaning any glaze that forms won’t melt quickly. Michigan districts tolerate cold and light snow, but they are comparatively risk-averse to freezing rain during the bus window, especially on secondary roads and in parking lots/sidewalks.\n\nThat said, the freezing-rain signal is narrow, winds are not high, and there’s no forecast snow accumulation—so a full closure is not the most likely outcome. The most plausible operational outcome is “open with caution” or a 2-hour delay depending on whether icing is observed during the early road checks. I therefore put full snow-day/closure probability at ~22% (with delay more likely than closure)."

That normally keeps closure odds from going high.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable pushing the probability down into the teens because the forecasted hazard type (pre-dawn **freezing rain**) is exactly the kind of event where districts can decide late (5–6 AM) and where even a trace glaze can quickly produce bus safety issues—especially if secondary roads or parking lots are slick. That risk elevates closure probability above “routine cold, no snow.”\n\nNetting those: “no closure signal yet” (down) + “ice in the decision window” (up) = a moderate closure risk but not the base case. I’d still treat a **delay** as more likely than a **full closure**, but since you asked for snow-day probability (closure), I’m at 28%."

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 408 PM EST, an ice jam remains in place on the Muskegon\nriver in southern Newaygo County. The river gauge at Newaygo\nshows water levels remaining at minor flood stage as of\nFriday afternoon. As temperatures warm this weekend, water\nlevels should continue to slowly fall. Shorter periods of\nrising and falling water levels are expected with any shifts\nin the ice.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
