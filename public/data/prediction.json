Expect slick spots from frost/black ice on untreated surfaces and potential reduced visibility around bus time (especially 4–7 AM when visibility is near ~1 mile). Winds are light to modest (S–SW 5–12 mph) and wind chills are mild for Michigan (~25°F at 6–8 AM), well above cold-closure thresholds. Net: schools should almost certainly be OPEN; at most, minor delays are possible if dense fog becomes locally worse than forecast or if widespread black ice develops, but the probability of a closure is very low (roughly 0–5%)."

Web cross-checking found a notable mismatch: Weather.com’s hourly forecast for the morning shows colder air temps (~26–28°F) and much colder feels-like (~14–16°F) with west/northwest winds around 14–17 mph and even a small snow amount (~0.1\") at 6 AM.

Importantly, none of the surfaced credible sources show ≤ -20°F wind chill in the 6–8 AM window, so the automatic closure threshold is NOT met based on this verification. However, because Weather.com (what many parents/staff actually see) is substantially colder on 'feels like' than the API, operational risk (frostbite exposure at bus stops, etc.) should be evaluated using the colder public-app scenario unless NWS point forecast confirms otherwise.",

The only meaningful hazard is freezing fog/low clouds with temps near 30–34°F, which can produce localized black ice (bridges/overpasses/shaded rural spots) and reduced visibility around bus hours. Historically in West Michigan, that setup rarely triggers a full closure without verified widespread glazing or widespread visibility <0.5 mile plus incident reports. Power grid conditions are stable (county-level outages essentially zero), and road agencies would typically be in patrol/spot-treatment mode—not overwhelmed. There is a forecast discrepancy where Weather.com looks colder/windier with a trace snow amount, but even that scenario does not meet extreme-cold closure thresholds and would mainly raise caution/slow travel rather than force a closure.\n\nRecommendation: treat Monday as a planned no-school day for RPS; no snow-day call is needed.

The only plausible weather-driven operational disruption is freezing fog near/just below freezing producing localized black ice and reduced visibility during the 5–8 AM window. That pattern more commonly yields caution messaging or, at most, a limited delay—full closures are uncommon without verified widespread glazing or very low visibility. I therefore place weather-driven closure probability very low (~3%), while acknowledging a non-zero delay risk if fog becomes denser than modeled."

        "shiftReason": "From a historical “what actually closes schools” perspective in West Michigan, a day with **no accumulating snow and no measurable precip** almost never triggers a district-wide closure; the typical outcome is school running with heightened caution. The only plausible weather mechanism here is **freezing fog near 32°F**, which can create localized slick spots (bridges/overpasses, rural low spots) and reduced visibility—conditions that historically yield *at most* a delay if road checks find widespread glaze.\n\nHowever, I’m heavily discounting even that small weather-closure probability because the NEWS agent indicates **Rockford Public Schools is already closed for a scheduled Mid-Winter Break on Monday, February 16, 2026**. If that’s accurate, the weather-based closure probability for Rockford on that date is essentially zero; any “closure” is predetermined, not weather-driven. To keep the debate framework (snow-day probability) coherent, I’m assigning a **~1%** chance of a weather-triggered closure decision (e.g., if a different local school entity were in session, or if the calendar info were wrong), but for Rockford Public Schools specifically it should functionally be **0% weather-driven**."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Monday 2026-02-16 does not present a classic snow-day scenario for Rockford, MI: there’s no forecast snowfall or freezing rain, winds are not extreme, and temperatures are near freezing but not dangerously cold. The credible risk is *localized*—patchy black ice from freezing fog deposition and intermittent low visibility during the early-morning transport window (roughly midnight–8 AM, with the most relevant time 5:30–7:30 AM). Those hazards more commonly result in targeted mitigations (spot treatment + cautious routing) or, if conditions verify worse than forecast, a delay rather than a full closure. Therefore I place full “snow day” (weather-driven closure) probability very low.\n\nImportant nuance: the NEWS agent indicates Rockford Public Schools may already be closed for a scheduled Mid-Winter Break on Monday 2/16/2026. If that’s correct, the probability of an *additional weather closure decision* is effectively moot (functionally 0%). I’m keeping a small non-zero value (2%) only because (a) we’re debating weather-driven closure risk in general, and (b) there is some cross-source forecast discrepancy (Weather.com colder/windier with a trace snow signal), which could marginally increase morning hazard if it verifies."

Because the district is not scheduled to be in session, the probability of a *weather-driven* snow day closure announcement for that date is extremely low.\n\nIf we reinterpret the question as “probability that Monday is functionally a ‘no school’ day,” then it’s ~100%—but that would be due to the calendar, not weather. Keeping the debate’s intent (weather-caused closure), I’m near the floor.\n\nThe only non-zero tail risk (hence 2% vs 0%) is ambiguity about which “target school” is being evaluated (e.g., a private school, a program still running, or a district that doesn’t observe that break), plus the possibility of a last-minute safety call if freezing fog is far denser than forecast. But even in that scenario, delays are more plausible than full closures."
