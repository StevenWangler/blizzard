Winds are modest (generally 8–12 mph), and morning wind chills are around 10°F—nowhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds. With no accumulating snow and no freezing rain indicated, road crews/plows are not a factor and a snow day is very unlikely.

However, The Weather Network’s hourly page for Rockford shows a MUCH colder solution for Monday (e.g., around 12am it lists roughly -11°F with feels-like -18°F), creating a safety-relevant discrepancy (>10°F). NWS (weather.gov) is authoritative, but the page snapshot available here appears to be an older/cached view with forecast validity only through Feb 1 in the footer; it mentions snow (~2\") and wind chill values for its valid period, but it cannot be used as a definitive Mon Feb 2 hourly wind chill check from this capture. Across the web sources that clearly show Mon Feb 2 hourly feels-like, none show ≤ -20°F during 6–8 AM, so the automatic extreme-cold closure trigger is not met.

That can create localized slick spots (black ice) and reduced visibility on bus routes, but the forecast visibility signal is not near typical closure thresholds and the risk is expected to be patchy rather than widespread. Infrastructure indications are ‘already clear’ with only possible spot-treatment; power outage risk is low; and there are no confirmed neighboring-district closures or Rockford PS signals for 02/02 at this time. Web verification showed conflicting temperature solutions across apps, but none show ≤ -20°F wind chills during bus hours (so no automatic cold-closure rule is triggered).

With 0 QPF and 0 snowfall forecast in the provided hourly/day data for Monday 2026-02-02, the usual drivers of a Michigan snow day (high snowfall rates during commute, plow lag, freezing rain accretion, blowing/drifting) are absent. That pushes the baseline probability very low.\n\nI’m not at ~0% because the forecast itself flags mist/freezing-fog potential (very high RH, overcast/stratus), and the minimum vis values (as low as ~1 mile at times, albeit mostly outside the core bus window) imply a nonzero chance that actual vis drops into the “dense fog” range locally. If widespread dense freezing fog (e.g., ≤0.25 mile) occurs 6–8 AM, or if verified black ice becomes widespread on multiple routes, a delay/closure becomes plausible.\n\nPeer input generally supports ‘very low’ closure odds, but the WEBWEATHERVERIFIER notes meaningful cross-source discrepancies (especially temperature) and at least one source hinting at light snow amounts (~0.1”). That uncertainty nudges me toward the upper end of the earlier 2–5% range rather than the bottom."

The only plausible disruption mechanism is localized freezing fog/mist creating patchy black ice + reduced visibility during morning transportation checks. That scenario more often produces a delay than a closure, so I keep full-closure probability low but non-zero. I also slightly hedge upward from the absolute minimum because peer verification shows some disagreement across public sources on temperature/snow signals, which can correlate with forecast uncertainty and last-minute operational decisions."

However, I’m higher than the 2–5% baseline because (a) fog/mist in subfreezing temps can create “surprise” black ice and sudden visibility loss, and (b) the WEBWEATHERVERIFIER shows notable cross-source disagreement on temps/snow signals, which increases uncertainty and pushes me to weight worst-case tails a bit more. Practically, the more plausible operational outcome (if conditions verify poorly) is a *delay* rather than a closure; but since the question is snow-day probability, I assign 8% to capture the small chance of widespread dense freezing fog + confirmed slick routes across multiple attendance areas."

For Mon 2026-02-02 in Rockford, there’s no official closure/delay yet and the provided forecast shows no snow/ice accumulation, modest winds, and temps in the teens/20s—conditions districts routinely operate in. The only meaningful disruption pathway is patchy freezing fog/black ice and reduced visibility during the bus window, which more commonly leads to a delay than a closure. Because the WebWeatherVerifier reports notable disagreement across sources (including hints of light snow on one site and a much colder solution on another), I won’t go as low as the absolute floor; I set a low-but-nonzero closure probability at 6%."

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 408 PM EST, an ice jam remains in place on the Muskegon\nriver in southern Newaygo County. The river gauge at Newaygo\nshows water levels remaining at minor flood stage as of\nFriday afternoon. As temperatures warm this weekend, water\nlevels should continue to slowly fall. Shorter periods of\nrising and falling water levels are expected with any shifts\nin the ice.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
