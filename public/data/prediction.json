Web cross-checking finds inconsistent outputs: Weather.com’s main Rockford, MI hourly page (Fahrenheit) shows early-morning feels-like around -12°F to -16°F, while another Weather.com hourly page (metric/alternate locale) shows far colder values (feels-like around -25°C to -26°C) that conflict with the Fahrenheit page and with the API. OpenSnow is milder. Because the feels-like is the decision-critical metric and we have a >10°F discrepancy across sources, you should treat the colder credible-feeling scenario (Weather.com Fahrenheit page) as the safer planning bound unless/ until NWS point forecast/hourly wind chills for Rockford confirm otherwise. None of the retrieved Rockford, MI sources definitively show ≤ -20°F wind chill for Monday 2/2 during 6–8 AM; however, the cross-source disagreement is significant and warrants another check closer to Sunday night.",

Net: low closure risk, with a slightly higher risk of a *delay* than a full snow day."

In West Michigan, that pattern’s closure base rate is very low. I set a **6%** chance of a full snow day for Monday 2026-02-02 to allow for (a) a forecast change introducing a narrow band of snow/freezing drizzle late Sunday night, or (b) a cold-policy closure if verified wind chills end up materially colder than the WeatherAPI light-wind scenario. Otherwise, the historical outcome is “open,” occasionally with a 2-hour delay if slick spots are widespread on back roads or visibility is unusually poor at bus time."

The only plausible closure pathway is a *surprise* icing/ice-fog situation or a colder-than-expected wind chill scenario that makes bus-stop exposure unacceptable. Given cross-source disagreement on ‘feels-like’ and the absence of Monday-specific hourlies in the provided dataset, I’m holding a small but non-trivial probability. My estimate centers on: likely no closure, some chance of a 2-hr delay if early route checks find patchy glaze and/or widespread low visibility."

I’m keeping probability above near-zero because (a) local districts have been weather-reactive in the past week, (b) there’s a non-trivial chance of last-minute decisions driven by patchy black ice or ice fog on bus routes, and (c) the web verifier notes a meaningful cross-source wind-chill/feels-like discrepancy—if Monday morning wind chills end up materially worse than the WeatherAPI scenario, a cold-triggered delay/closure becomes more plausible.
