With the data provided, I’d calibrate the closure probability near the low end of that range (≈2–4%), and a delay probability slightly higher (≈5–10%) only if you know roads are already slick from prior conditions."

      "Secondary/rural roads should also be fine; the only realistic hazard would be isolated slick intersections/stop-sign approaches from compacted snow or overnight re-freeze of any residual moisture.",
      "Parking lots/sidewalks: have crews spot-treat entrances, bus loops, and parent drop-off zones for traction—especially if there is existing packed snow from previous events. No new accumulation is expected.",
      "Operational suggestion: run normal schedule but remind families about cold-weather gear and add a little buffer for buses (cold can slow loading and increase late-bus exposure).",

Web cross-checking is inconsistent: Weather.com returns conflicting hourly values depending on the page variant (one shows mid-20s/teens feels-like with light snow showers; another shows sub-freezing C temps with feels-like around -17 to -19°C). Weather Underground indicates an advisory banner but the captured snippet does not provide a clean 6–8 AM Monday feels-like for 2026-02-09. The only clear conclusion from the sources captured in this run: none of them show ≤ -20°F wind chill for Rockford during 6–8 AM Monday; however, the magnitude of disagreement (>10°F) means you should not treat any single non-official app value as definitive without a live refresh (especially NWS point forecast/hourly wind chill for Rockford).",

The main upward adjustments come from (1) Forest Hills already calling a 2-hour delay (a real domino/context clue) and (2) the only realistic hazard being legacy slick spots from prior moisture/compaction refreezing in single-digit temps. However, with no confirmation of widespread icy roads or an outage cluster, the most Brier-optimal call remains strongly ‘OPEN,’ with a small but non-zero chance of a delay or surprise operational issue.

The only meaningful uncertainty is non-forecast/legacy conditions (leftover packed snow, melt-refreeze, localized black ice) and cross-source inconsistency noted by the verifier; those justify keeping probability above 0%, but not by much.

The primary safety concern is student exposure to cold at bus stops during the early morning (roughly 6–9 AM), but the forecast wind chills near 0°F are generally not sufficient alone to trigger a closure in Michigan districts accustomed to winter operations. The remaining closure risk comes from non-forecast factors: localized black ice if there is residual moisture from previous days, or an unverified facility issue (e.g., a localized power/heating failure).

Pair that with the provided forecast (no new snow/ice; light wind; OK visibility), and the baseline closure likelihood is very low.

The only weather-related operational concern is cold exposure at bus stops (feels-like roughly near 0°F), which on its own rarely triggers full closure. That keeps the closure probability very low. I’m not at 0% because non-meteorological residual risks can still close schools (e.g., widespread pre-existing slickness/black ice from prior days, or a facility issue like heat/power), and because cross-source verification flagged some inconsistency in third-party hourly depictions (though none suggest truly extreme wind chills)."

Historically, districts in this region do not cancel for temperatures around ~9–25°F unless there is an extreme wind-chill component or a compounding hazard (active precip, drifting, widespread ice). The only meaningful uncertainty is non-forecast/legacy conditions (leftover packed snow, melt-refreeze, localized black ice) and cross-source inconsistency noted by the verifier; those justify keeping probability above 0%, but not by much. Net: I land at ~3% closure risk, with a somewhat higher (but not asked) delay risk if there’s known leftover slickness."

With no new snow or ice forecast and light winds, system-wide travel hazards (bus routes, parent drop-off, staff commute) should be manageable. The primary safety concern is student exposure to cold at bus stops during the early morning (roughly 6–9 AM), but the forecast wind chills near 0°F are generally not sufficient alone to trigger a closure in Michigan districts accustomed to winter operations. The remaining closure risk comes from non-forecast factors: localized black ice if there is residual moisture from previous days, or an unverified facility issue (e.g., a localized power/heating failure). Given the data presented, a snow day is unlikely; a delay would be more plausible than a closure if patchy slick spots are observed at dawn."

As of Sun Feb 8, neither the district nor the major broadcast closings pages showed an active closure/delay for Mon Feb 9. Pair that with the provided forecast (no new snow/ice; light wind; OK visibility), and the baseline closure likelihood is very low. I’m keeping the probability slightly above the meteorology-only floor because recent area closures + road-commission messaging suggest there *could* be leftover slick spots/compacted snow issues that sometimes produce a surprise delay/closure call in the pre-dawn checks—even without new precip. Net: low single digits."
