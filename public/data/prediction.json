Temperatures stay in the 24–29°F range all day and all night, remaining below freezing but with only modest wind (generally 5–11 mph), producing wind chills mostly in the upper teens to mid-20s—uncomfortable but not hazardous by Michigan standards. There is no forecast precipitation (0.00\" liquid, 0.0 cm snow, 0% chance of snow or rain) and skies trend from overcast before sunrise to partly cloudy during the school day. Visibility is occasionally reduced to around 1–2 miles overnight in low clouds or mist but improves to typical winter values (4–6+ miles) during daylight hours. Roads will be cold and dry, and any thin glaze from Thursday’s light freezing rain will have had time to be treated and stabilized with no new moisture falling. There are no weather alerts in effect. From a Michigan school-operations perspective—where several inches of snow or widespread ice are usually required for closures—there is no credible meteorological basis for a snow day or delay on Friday. Conditions support a normal school day with standard winter driving precautions only."

Historically, Rockford and similar West Michigan districts do not close for this kind of weather—closures more often coincide with active snowstorms (8–10+ inches with bad timing), serious ice storms, blizzard‑type conditions, or extreme cold. This pattern matches numerous past mid‑December days when schools operated on a normal schedule. Accordingly, the historical analogue points to essentially a 0% likelihood of a snow day driven by weather alone for Friday, with high confidence that conditions will be considered routine winter weather for this area."

Likewise, the usual West Michigan closing lists from WZZM, WOOD TV8, MLive, and Fox 17 do **not** yet show a Friday list at the time of this check, suggesting decisions are either not made or not posted publicly.

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Dry, seasonably cold, no impactful winter weather on Friday; no precip day or night; roads cold and dry.\n- Historian: This pattern (cold, dry, no snow/ice during commute) historically yields essentially 0% chance of closure.\n- Safety analyst: Roads largely clear with only residual slick spots; morning and afternoon commute impacts minimal; risk level low.\n- News intel: While earlier in the week had winter storm headlines, there is no specific Friday storm focus, no Friday closures posted, and community sentiment is watchful/uncertain, not \"guaranteed snow day.\"\n\nAll agree Friday itself does not feature an active storm or widespread hazardous conditions that typically drive closures.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- Mild tension only: news articles reference a broader winter storm watch and 5–7\" plus glaze in the region earlier in the week, implying lingering slickness. However, the meteorological forecast provided for the actual target date shows that storm has already passed, leaving a dry cold day. Safety analysis aligns with this, rating Friday risk low.\n- There is no direct forecast conflict about Friday: all domain experts converge on routine winter conditions with manageable residual slick patches.\n\nGiven this, there is no substantial conflict requiring tool-based resolution: the earlier-watch context is clearly time-shifted (Wed–Thu focus), while our forecast is for Friday with dry conditions.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from \"snow end\" to ~7:40 AM)\n- The provided meteorological analysis explicitly gives 0% snow probability overnight and 0\" new snow; effectively, the system is over before our analysis window, and no snow falls between Thursday evening and Friday morning.\n- That means plow crews have the *entire night* to finish treating any residual issues from the prior light freezing drizzle.\n- Practical effect: effectively \"infinite\" plow window, as there is no competing falling snow. Roads transition to a cold, stable state with spot treatment rather than active clearing.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorology: Mentions that any thin glaze from Thursday’s light freezing rain will have had time to be treated and stabilized with no new moisture; roads expected to be cold and dry.\n- Safety: Notes moderate ice *formation risk* only in typical trouble spots (parking lots, shaded sidewalks, drainage areas) due to refreeze, and recommends routine salting/sanding. Overall risk level: low.\n- No ongoing freezing rain, drizzle, or mixed precip is forecast for Friday.\n- Conclusion: There may be *localized* black ice on untreated micro-surfaces, but there is no sign of a district-wide ice event. This is far below the \"ice storm\" or widespread glaze threshold that would push probabilities into closure territory.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel explicitly reports:\n  - No official announcements of Friday closures or delays for Rockford or neighboring districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD).\n  - No regional closing lists published for Friday yet from the major local media outlets.\n- There are midweek closures earlier in the week in parts of West Michigan, but those were tied to storm timing earlier than Friday.\n- Net: 0 neighboring Friday closures currently confirmed → no upward adjustment from the neighboring-district rule (+15–20% if 3+ neighbors close) is warranted.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\n- A surprise overnight event not in the current forecast: e.g., unmodeled freezing drizzle or dense freezing fog creating a widespread glaze on roads and sidewalks by dawn.\n- A late-shift in the storm track causing additional accumulating snow or mixed precip to return overnight.\n- Administrative decisions driven by factors not in the data (e.g., building issues, staffing shortages, power outages). Current intel shows no such issues.\n- Given the strong multi-source agreement (weather, history, safety, and news), these are low-probability tail risks.\n\n2. WEIGHTING OF EXPERT INPUTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Clear, high-confidence forecast of 0% precip, 0\" snow, temps mid-20s°F, light wind, no alerts. This strongly favors *no closure*.\n- Safety (25%): Primary and secondary roads 9–10/10, minimal commute impact, overall low risk. Reinforces meteorological signal.\n- History (20%): Multiple analog patterns all show 0% historical snow-day rate for this exact scenario. Strong downward pressure on any closure probability.\n- News/Intel (20%): Storm-related headlines are for earlier days; for Friday, there are *no* closure announcements, *no* strong community \"we’re closing\" chatter, and no evidence that neighboring districts have preemptively pulled the plug. This supports a normal day and offers no reason to increase odds.\n\nStarting from Michigan threshold guidance:\n- Expected new snow for Friday: effectively 0\" with no active storm → baseline snow-day probability well under the <4\" category (5–15%).\n- Adjust DOWN using history (near-0% historical closure in this pattern) and safety (low risk, clear roads). Even a 5–10% baseline is likely too high in this case.\n- News intel does not give any of the bullish closure signals (no 3+ neighbors closed, no strong expectation of closure), so there is **no upward adjustment**.\n\nCombining all weighted inputs, the rational calibrated estimate for an operational decision is about **2%**—acknowledging a small chance of unforeseen issues or administrative surprises, while remaining consistent with the data and scoring well on Brier metrics.\n\n3. FINAL DECISION\n- This is a textbook \"cold but routine\" Michigan winter day: no storm, no accumulating snow, no extreme cold, and no district- or region-wide ice event.\n- All four expert domains converge on the same conclusion: **normal school operations**.\n\nTherefore, I set the **snow day probability at 2% with very high confidence**, well below any reasonable closure threshold and safely outside the 40–60% \"uncertain\" band you want to avoid.",
