    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Wednesday, January 14, 2026, this is a cold, dry, overcast post-frontal day with no snow or ice issues expected. Temperatures start just above freezing around midnight (~36°F) but fall below freezing by the bus window (about 31–33°F at 7–8 AM) and continue dropping into the low 20s by late afternoon, with wind chills in the single digits to low teens. Forecast precipitation is 0.00\" with 0.0 cm snow and essentially 0% modeled chance of rain or snow at all hours; this strongly favors dry pavement, aside from any leftover wet spots refreezing from Tuesday’s light rain. Winds are breezy from the WNW to N at 12–18 mph with gusts near 20 mph, adding bite to the cold but not at a level that causes blowing snow problems, especially given no new snowfall. Visibility averages around 4–6 miles under overcast skies; occasional 0-mile values in the model later in the evening likely represent data artifacts rather than true whiteout or dense fog, since there is no active precip and winds remain up, which typically limits dense radiation fog. For a West Michigan district used to winter conditions, this pattern—no accumulating snow, no ice storm, and snow ending well before 4 AM (in fact, none at all)—does not meet typical criteria for a snow day. Expect a normal school day with cold, breezy, overcast conditions but no major travel disruptions."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the forecast for Wednesday, 2026-01-14, Rockford is looking at a classic post-front January day: overcast, breezy, and turning colder, but dry. Hourly data show temps around 30–33°F overnight into the early morning, with northwest winds 10–15 mph and gusts near 20–30 mph. By the time buses would typically be running (around 6–9 AM), air temps are near 31°F dropping into the upper 20s°F, with wind chills roughly in the low-to-mid 20s°F – far from Michigan’s extreme-cold closure thresholds around -15°F wind chill.\n\nThrough the school day, air temps slip into the 20s°F with wind chills trending into the low teens, bottoming out late afternoon and evening with apparent temps near or just below 0°F only after school hours. There is no measurable snowfall in the forecast (totalsnow_cm = 0, no hourly snow shown, and 0% daily chance of snow), no mixed precipitation, and visibility generally 4–10 miles for the times when school is in session. Winds are breezy but not at blizzard criteria, and with no fresh powder on the ground, blowing and drifting remain limited.\n\nHistorically for Rockford and the broader West Michigan region, this setup – dry pavement or only minor leftover wetness, seasonal cold, and moderate wind – almost never leads to school closures. Districts in this area routinely remain open with similar or slightly harsher conditions. The absence of key closure drivers (8–10+ inches of poorly timed snow, ice storms, or bitter wind chills below -15°F) strongly argues against a snow day.\n\nOverall, using comparable mid-January patterns, the implied probability of a weather-related closure for Wednesday, 2026-01-14, is very low – on the order of only a few percent at most. Confidence in “school runs on normal schedule” is high, assuming no last-minute, unmodeled event (such as a surprise ice issue or non-weather emergency)."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement and conflicts\n- Meteorologist: Clearly states a cold, dry, overcast day with 0.00\" precip and 0.0 cm snow, no snow or ice issues expected, and explicitly concludes this does not meet criteria for a snow day.\n- Historian: Shows similar past patterns almost never cause closures (2–5% historically) and notes that none of the usual closure triggers (heavy snow, ice, extreme cold) are present.\n- Safety analyst: Rates roads and travel as good (9/10 on primary/secondary roads, low overall risk) with only patchy refreeze risk and explicitly states conditions do not justify closing or delaying school.\n- News & community intel: No current closures or delays in Rockford or neighboring districts, no countywide advisories, and forecasts/media language framing this as routine winter driving, not a big storm. Community chatter expects ‘slow and slippery’ at most, not a snow day.\nAll four point in the same direction: very low closure likelihood. There are no substantive conflicts—only a slight mismatch between some media wording about ‘accumulating snow’ vs. the provided forecast data, which shows 0\" new snow. Given our direct meteorological dataset and the safety scores, I weight the technical forecast more heavily than generic TV phrasing.\n\n2. Plow timing math\n- Total new snow forecast: 0\". \n- Snow end time: effectively N/A; the meteorological analysis indicates no active snow at all on Wednesday.\n- Plow demand: none for new accumulation; only normal salting/sanding for potential overnight refreeze on isolated spots.\n- From ‘last weather impact’ to first bell: any minor refreeze develops gradually overnight, giving road crews many hours before the 7:40 AM bus window to address bridges/overpasses. This strongly favors normal operations.\n\n3. Ice risk\n- Meteorology: Prior light rain on Tuesday with temps falling below freezing overnight; no new precip. That implies only residual moisture refreezing.\n- Safety: Classifies ice-formation risk as moderate but localized, and still assigns high scores to road conditions (8–9/10) and minimal commute impact. No mixed precip or active freezing rain is forecast.\n- Net: There is *some* patchy black ice risk, especially on untreated surfaces and bridges, but not a systemic ice event. This is well within the range that districts in Kent County routinely manage without closing.\n\n4. Neighboring districts and community signals\n- News intel explicitly checks Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, and Kent ISD: none have announced closures or delays, and TV closing lists are empty for Jan. 14 as of the analysis time.\n- Road authorities (Kent County Road Commission/MDOT) report normal winter operations, no travel advisories or emergencies.\n- Social media sentiment is ‘uncertain but watching,’ with expectations of typical slick spots, not stay-home conditions.\nGiven the rule that 3+ neighboring districts closing would add 15–20% to the probability, here we have the opposite: zero closures and no strong community push for closing. That supports staying near the historical base rate (a few percent) rather than bumping it up.\n\n5. Weighting of experts (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Dominant signal. 0\" snow, 0% precip, non-extreme cold. Strongly argues against closure.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk, good road scores, minimal commute impact. Reinforces a low probability.\n- History (20%): Analog days produce closure rates around 2–5%. This anchors the numeric estimate.\n- News/Intel (20%): No closures, no emergency messaging, community expectation of a normal school day. Slight downward pressure on any higher guess that might be suggested by generic TV ‘messy commute’ language.\nCombining these, a forecast probability around 7% is consistent: slightly above the bare-minimum 2–3% historical rate to account for modest refreeze and the ever-present possibility of a localized issue, but still within the 5–15% Michigan threshold range for <4\" with no storm.\n\n6. What would make this wrong?\nThe main ways this 7% estimate could be off are:\n- Unmodeled overnight event: An unexpected snow band sets up and drops several inches on Rockford specifically, contrary to the current 0\" forecast.\n- Surprise ice: More residual moisture than expected plus inefficient salting leads to widespread black ice and multiple early crashes, prompting a last-minute safety-based closure or delay.\n- Non-weather factors: Infrastructure failure (e.g., power outage at multiple buildings) or a bus fleet/mechanical issue unrelated to the forecast.\nThese scenarios are low probability but not zero, which is why the prediction is not 0% but in the single digits.\n\n7. Final calibration vs. Michigan thresholds\n- Expected snow: effectively <1\" (actually 0\"). Michigan threshold guidance says <4\" → 5–15%.\n- No ice storm, no blizzard, no advisory, no 3+ neighboring district closures.\n- Historical analogs and expert consensus all push toward the lower end of that band.\nThus I place the snow-day probability at 7% with high confidence that Rockford will hold a normal school day on Jan. 14, 2026.",
