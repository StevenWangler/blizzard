Temperatures remain well below freezing all day (high ~16°F, low ~-8°F). The key snow-day metric: morning bus-time wind chills run roughly -12°F to -16°F (not at the automatic -20°F closure trigger, but cold enough to be a decision factor). Winds are light (generally 5–9 mph), so blowing/drifting snow is not a concern. Precip amounts are very low (~0.01\" liquid equivalent) with essentially no snow accumulation indicated; precip appears to shut off well before the morning commute, giving ample time for treatment. Net: low closure probability from snow; the only realistic closure pathway is isolated icy spots + very cold wind chills, which more often leads to normal operations (possibly with extra caution) in Michigan unless districts have a strict wind-chill policy."

Weather Underground data found was not aligned to the target morning window (and appeared dated to 1/28 late evening), so it is less useful for the decision point.

Per the non-negotiable Extreme Cold Rules, ONE credible source at ≤ -20°F during bus hours forces a 90–95% closure probability because of student exposure at stops and operational bus-start concerns. \n\nEven setting cold aside, there is a credible (though likely patchy) black-ice/glaze risk from light freezing drizzle/freezing rain around midnight–2 AM, and in subzero air/pavement temperatures any slickness will not “improve quickly.” Infrastructure and safety inputs agree: main roads should generally be workable, but secondary/neighborhood roads can remain variable—this profile often leads to delays rather than full closure. However, the extreme wind-chill trigger dominates the closure decision under your rules, so the final probability is kept in the mandated 90–95% range.\n\nWhat could make this wrong (i.e., schools stay open): if the Weather.com wind chills are materially overstated and actual 6–8 AM wind chills verify closer to -10°F to -15°F, and if the overnight glaze is minimal/treated, Rockford could run on-time or with a delay.

With trace QPF and no organized snow during commute hours, a full closure is usually uncommon; more typical would be “open” or possibly a delay if a glaze develops on untreated surfaces.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable going “very low” because the cross-source wind-chill discrepancy is substantial, and if wind chills truly reach -20°F to -27°F during the bus window, many districts’ exposure policies (and operational tolerance) shift quickly. Without an authoritative NWS point forecast / wind-chill advisory confirmation in the packet, I’m splitting the difference: baseline low-to-moderate closure chance driven by ice, plus an upward adjustment for the credible possibility that wind chills are worse than the WeatherAPI feed indicates.",

Safety planning should assume the colder scenario for exposure mitigation (stop supervision, communications), but closure probability should still be anchored to whether travel conditions fail system-wide.\n\nNet: **~28%** chance of a full snow day (closure).

With trace QPF and no organized snow during commute hours, a full closure is usually uncommon; more typical would be “open” or possibly a delay if a glaze develops on untreated surfaces.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable going “very low” because the cross-source wind-chill discrepancy is substantial, and if wind chills truly reach -20°F to -27°F during the bus window, many districts’ exposure policies (and operational tolerance) shift quickly. Without an authoritative NWS point forecast / wind-chill advisory confirmation in the packet, I’m splitting the difference: baseline low-to-moderate closure chance driven by ice, plus an upward adjustment for the credible possibility that wind chills are worse than the WeatherAPI feed indicates."

But the forecasted precip amounts for Fri 1/30 are near-trace and the commute window looks mostly dry, which historically caps full-closure likelihood.

In a winter-hardened district like Rockford, that profile typically leads to normal operations or a 2-hour delay rather than a full closure—unless early route checks find widespread untreated glaze on secondary roads. \n\nI’m intentionally *not* jumping to a very high closure probability solely on the Weather.com “feels like” discrepancy: wind chill below -20°F would matter if Rockford has a strict automatic threshold, but we don’t have the district’s specific policy in the packet, and the point-forecast sources disagree significantly. Safety planning should assume the colder scenario for exposure mitigation (stop supervision, communications), but closure probability should still be anchored to whether travel conditions fail system-wide.\n\nNet: **~28%** chance of a full snow day (closure). I’d put the implicit “2-hour delay” chance higher than that, but the prompt is closure-only."

With forecast precip amounts near-trace, a full closure is not the default outcome.\n\nHowever, I’m not comfortable going “low” because (a) the district has explicitly been framing January as operationally challenging, (b) nearby districts/ISD programs have closed very recently, and (c) there’s a non-trivial chance the key driver is **wind chill** rather than snow/ice totals—where the Weather.com scenario (below -20°F) would plausibly push toward closure for student exposure at stops.\n\nNet: I land at **35%** for a full snow day (closure), with a higher chance of a **delay** than a closure if conditions are merely patchy-icy and wind chills stay closer to -10°F to -15°F."

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 418 PM EST, an ice jam continues to be reported by local\nauthorities on the Muskegon river in southern Newaygo County.\nThe river gauge at Newaygo shows water levels remaining at\nminor flood stage as of Wednesday afternoon.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
