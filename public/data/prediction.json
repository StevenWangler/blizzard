Wind chills during bus time (6–8 AM) are roughly 14–15°F—well above Michigan cold-closure thresholds (not a factor). The only meaningful school-operations risk in this dataset is visibility: multiple overnight/morning hours report near-zero visibility and there’s a freezing fog mention late (11 PM). If that dense/freezing fog verifies into the 6–8 AM window, you could see slick spots on untreated bridges/side roads plus reduced visibility for buses. However, with zero precip/snow and very light wind, the most likely outcome is normal winter driving and schools OPEN. Snow-day/closure probability: ~5% (mostly tied to a low-confidence dense/freezing fog scenario)."

Treat this as a black-ice/low-visibility hazard window, especially on bridges/overpasses and low-lying rural areas.",
      "For Thu morning bus routes (roughly 06:30–08:00): temps ~23–22°F with light winds; no falling precip. If any patchy fog develops, use reduced speeds, increase following distance, and avoid hard braking at known slick intersections.",
      "Have transportation staff check the usual problem spots before first routes: bridge decks, shaded curves, low spots near creeks/wetlands, and north-facing stretches. If there’s fog, a quick 'test brake' at low speed in a safe area helps drivers gauge traction.",
      "Parking lots/drop-off loops: with subfreezing temps all day and no new snow, conditions depend on what’s already on the ground. Scrape/spot-salt entrances, crosswalk paint areas, and bus loading zones to prevent polished ice.",
      "Student pedestrian safety: remind families that sidewalks may be icy even if roads are fine; consider extra crossing-guard caution at sunrise when glare + any fog can reduce driver detection distances.",
      "Decision guidance for the district: a snow day is **unlikely** on Thu based on this forecast alone. The only scenario that meaningfully raises closure odds is widespread dense/freezing fog coinciding with the morning commute (not strongly indicated for Thu AM here; the clearest fog signal is late Thu night)."

I attempted to cross-check with Weather.com, NWS, AccuWeather, Weather Underground, and local news pages; however, the accessible web snapshots returned either (a) wrong-date hourlies (Weather.com pages showing October or Feb 5), (b) wrong-location NWS digital tables (coordinates not matching Rockford, MI), or (c) pages that don’t expose the needed hourly wind chill in the captured HTML (Weather Underground), or (d) regional—not Rockford-specific—conditions (local TV page). Because of these issues, the web evidence is insufficient to validate Thu 2026-02-12 6–8 AM wind chills with high confidence. Importantly, none of the retrieved web sources credibly indicates wind chill ≤ -20°F for that morning window.",

Historically, these “cold/dry” days almost always operate normally. The only meaningful closure pathway is a localized hazard: dense/freezing fog and overnight refreeze producing reduced visibility and patchy black ice (especially bridges, low spots, and rural bus routes). Safety clarified that the forecast’s lowest-visibility window overlaps the Thu morning bus period, but this kind of hazard in West Michigan typically leads to heightened caution or a 2-hour delay in select cases—not a full closure—unless there are widespread verified road issues at 5–6 AM. News intelligence found no confirmed neighboring-district closure domino effect and no Rockford closure messaging, which further supports staying open. Power-outage-driven closure risk is also low given calm weather and only small, scattered statewide outages.\n\nRecommendation: OPEN with monitoring; be prepared to pivot to a 2-hour delay only if dense fog + widespread slick-spot reports materialize on early route checks.",

That combination almost never produces a true “snow day.” The only non-snow closure pathway is dense/freezing fog (near-saturated RH, very low vis fields, and a freezing-fog condition flagged late). If that scenario verifies during the morning commute, a delay (more than a closure) becomes plausible due to localized glaze on untreated surfaces and reduced visibility. Because the fog signal is inconsistent (0 km vis appearing for many hours with no precip, which can be model/artifact-y), I keep the overall closure probability low and put most of the 5% in the ‘fog/black-ice surprise at daybreak’ bucket."

However, because the clearest freezing-fog flag is at **23:00 Thu** (late) rather than explicitly centered on **Thu 6–8 AM**, I’m not willing to move into double-digit closure odds. Net: low likelihood of a snow day, with most of the residual risk concentrated in a narrow scenario where dense/freezing fog persists into bus time and produces widespread slick spots on untreated roads/bridges."

The only meaningful closure pathway is *dense/freezing fog* producing near-zero visibility plus localized glaze on untreated surfaces during the morning transportation window. The hourly forecast’s strongest freezing-fog signal is late Thursday night (23:00) rather than pre-dawn Thursday, and several 0-visibility hours look potentially artifact-like. Net: low snow-day probability, slightly above ‘near-zero’ because visibility/black-ice risk can be disproportionately disruptive for buses on rural routes if it verifies at daybreak."

That said, the absence of (a) any official RPS closure signal, (b) any neighboring-district closure cascade, and (c) any forecasted accumulating precip keeps this firmly in low-probability territory. My estimate is weighted toward a *delay* scenario driven by isolated-but-widespread slick spots on untreated roads/bridges during bus time, not a full closure."
