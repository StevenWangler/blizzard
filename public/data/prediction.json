No snow is forecast, and the only measurable precip arrives late evening as light rain (~0.03\"). The main minor issue is mist/low visibility at times (generally 5–6 miles, briefly ~3 miles in the evening), which typically does not justify closure in West Michigan. Expect roads to be mostly fine for the AM bus run; at most, watch for a few slick spots on untreated surfaces early due to subfreezing temps and high humidity, but impacts should be localized. Snow day probability: very low (~1–5%); delay probability: low (~3–8%), mainly if fog/mist locally thickens or there are isolated icy patches."

That said, there’s no measurable precip during the morning commute in the forecast, no snow, and winds are not high—so the hazard is unlikely to be uniform enough to force a full closure across Rockford/Kent County. This setup more commonly produces ‘drive cautiously / maybe a 2-hour delay’ decisions than a snow day.

The remaining risk is a ‘surprise’ morning: patchy black ice from refreeze after Wed rain + mist/fog reducing visibility on rural/bridge segments. That scenario can prompt isolated delays/route adjustments, but it rarely produces a full-district closure absent widespread crashes, rapid freezing drizzle, or confirmed untreated-road problems.

The main risk is *localized* slick spots (black ice) between ~5–9 AM as temperatures sit in the mid-20s with very high humidity/mist after a wet/very mild Wednesday. That type of hazard more often supports ‘extra caution’ or occasionally a delay than a full closure, especially in a metro-adjacent district with routine salting on priority routes. Therefore I keep full snow-day/closure probability very low but non-zero due to the patchy-ice uncertainty at neighborhood scale."

Here, the plausible hazard is patchy refreeze after Wed 2/18 rain, amplified by high humidity/mist—more consistent with isolated slick spots and potentially a delay than a full closure.

The highest risk window overlaps the bus/teen-driver commute (roughly 5–9 AM) when temps are subfreezing and yesterday’s rainfall could leave residual moisture that refreezes. That said, there’s no measurable precip during the morning commute in the forecast, no snow, and winds are not high—so the hazard is unlikely to be uniform enough to force a full closure across Rockford/Kent County. This setup more commonly produces ‘drive cautiously / maybe a 2-hour delay’ decisions than a snow day. I’m placing full-closure probability at 7% (low, but not near-zero) specifically because patchy black ice can be hard to detect and can trigger conservative calls if multiple early-morning slide-offs occur on back roads."

The weather setup shown for Thu (Feb 19, 2026) also lacks the usual closure triggers (snow accumulation during commute, freezing rain, high winds/blowing snow, extreme wind chills). The remaining risk is a ‘surprise’ morning: patchy black ice from refreeze after Wed rain + mist/fog reducing visibility on rural/bridge segments. That scenario can prompt isolated delays/route adjustments, but it rarely produces a full-district closure absent widespread crashes, rapid freezing drizzle, or confirmed untreated-road problems. Net: low single-digit closure probability; delay odds likely higher than closure but still not dominant given the light-wind/no-snow forecast."

Based on current expected rainfall, no\nsignificant flooding is expected on West Michigan rivers, though\ntypical spring water level rises within the river channels will\nhappen.\n\nMeanwhile, river ice has weakened significantly over the last week,\nand as water levels rise any remaining ice will likely be broken and\nstart to move downstream. This creates the possibility for formation\nof a few ice jams. Ice jams tend to form in the same places\nrepeatedly, so special attention should be paid in the Comstock Park\n(Kent County) area as well as the Robinson Township (Ottawa County)\narea along the Grand River.\n\nAnyone living or working near West Michigan rivers should pay extra\nattention this week as water levels rise. Have a plan to monitor and\nrespond if flooding develops unexpectedly.\n\nMonitor the latest conditions at https://water.noaa.gov\n",
