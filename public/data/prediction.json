My Michigan-calibrated call: **Snow day (full closure) ~10–15%**. If early-morning visibility is truly near-zero AND there are widespread reports of slick roads, that jumps into the **20–30%** range (more likely a delay than a closure)."

Ask MDOT/county dispatch about bridge decks and known slick hotspots before 5:30–6:00 AM.",
      "Stagger/soften bus stop expectations: communicate to families that pickups may run a few minutes late due to low visibility; advise students to wait in a safe location until the bus is approaching (reduces roadside exposure/visibility risk).",

      "If visibility is near-zero on key rural routes at 6:00–7:00 AM, consider *localized* adjustments (hold buses for a short delay, or limited-route modifications) rather than a full district closure—this setup is typically manageable in Michigan unless fog is exceptionally dense and widespread.",

Historically, that setup rarely produces a full district-wide closure in West Michigan; at most it tends to produce caution messaging or an occasional delay when visibility is persistently near-zero.\n\nHowever, the News Intelligence Agent verified via multiple official Rockford Public Schools sources (homepage reminders, district calendar, academic calendar, district news, and superintendent update) that Fri Feb 13, 2026 is already a scheduled district-wide NO SCHOOL day for Mid Winter Break. Therefore, the probability of an *additional weather-driven snow day/closure announcement* for Rockford Public Schools is extremely low.\n\nWhat would make this wrong? If the user’s target is not Rockford Public Schools (e.g., a private program still running), then freezing fog could still justify localized cancellations/delays; and if any credible source updates to wind chill ≤ -20°F at 6–8 AM, closure probability would jump per safety rules (not currently indicated in the provided evidence).",

With no forecast accumulation, plowable snow isn’t a factor. The real risk is fog/freezing fog during bus hours: near-zero visibility can be more dangerous than light snow because drivers have little time to react at crossings and on high-speed connectors. That said, most Michigan districts can operate through fog with strict bus protocols and targeted spot-treatment unless the fog is both widespread and persistent right at 6–8 AM. Therefore, I put the **weather-driven full-closure** probability low (4%), with a higher implicit probability of **minor operational adjustments** (e.g., caution messaging or localized delays).

If we reinterpret the question as “would weather conditions have caused an unscheduled closure if it were a normal school day,” the weather setup (no precip, manageable winds/temps) points strongly against a closure. The only meaningful disruption risk is freezing fog/dense mist around the bus window, which more commonly yields caution messaging or, at most, a delay—particularly if visibility stays near zero on rural routes at 6–8 AM.

        "shiftReason": "As the HISTORY specialist, I’d normally place a **~10–15%** chance of a *weather-based closure* for a “freezing fog + near-zero visibility at bus time, no new snow” pattern, with higher odds of a **delay** than a closure. However, the NEWS agent’s finding that **there is already no school scheduled for Feb 13, 2026 (Mid Winter Break)** collapses the practical ‘snow day’ probability. Interpreting the prompt as ‘Will there be a snow-day-style closure announcement due to weather?’, I put it at **~2%** to allow for edge cases (e.g., cancellation of limited programs/activities, building access issues, or a different local district than RPS)."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety/operations lens, Friday 2026-02-13 looks like a classic ‘low-visibility + possible patchy glaze’ morning rather than a snow/ice storm. With no forecast accumulation, plowable snow isn’t a factor. The real risk is fog/freezing fog during bus hours: near-zero visibility can be more dangerous than light snow because drivers have little time to react at crossings and on high-speed connectors. That said, most Michigan districts can operate through fog with strict bus protocols and targeted spot-treatment unless the fog is both widespread and persistent right at 6–8 AM. Therefore, I put the **weather-driven full-closure** probability low (4%), with a higher implicit probability of **minor operational adjustments** (e.g., caution messaging or localized delays). Separately, if the decision is ‘Is there school?’ the answer is ‘No’ due to the scheduled break, but that’s not a weather cancellation."

        "shiftReason": "As the news specialist, I weight official district communications heavily. The district’s own website/calendar/news indicate **no school on Feb 13, 2026 due to Mid Winter Break**, meaning any “closure” is scheduled rather than reactive to weather. If we reinterpret the question as “would weather conditions have caused an unscheduled closure if it were a normal school day,” the weather setup (no precip, manageable winds/temps) points strongly against a closure. The only meaningful disruption risk is freezing fog/dense mist around the bus window, which more commonly yields caution messaging or, at most, a delay—particularly if visibility stays near zero on rural routes at 6–8 AM. Given that, I put the weather-driven closure probability very low."
