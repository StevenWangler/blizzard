Web retrieval did not successfully yield clean, date-specific Mon Feb 9 hourly 'feels like' values from Weather.gov (NWS) or AccuWeather. The Weather.com hourly page content that was retrievable appears misaligned to early-Feb dates (Feb 1/Feb 2) rather than Feb 9, so it cannot be used as a trustworthy cross-check for the target school day. A local-news item citing NWS discusses a weekend cold snap with some -20°F wind chills in parts of Michigan, but it is not Rockford-specific for Monday morning and does not contradict the WeatherAPI warming-by-early-week pattern. Based on what is actually verified here, there is NO evidence that Mon 2026-02-09 morning wind chills drop to ≤ -20°F in Rockford.",

The only credible disruptor is visibility (possible dense fog/low stratus) with a secondary, localized risk of black ice from fog/mist deposition or refreeze on bridges/overpasses and shaded rural connectors. Even if that verifies, Rockford-area districts more commonly choose a short delay or operational mitigations (route checks, reduced speeds) rather than a full-day closure. \n\nConflicts were resolved as follows: Safety rated ice risk “moderate” despite 0 precip; on clarification, that was based on localized glaze/black-ice mechanisms (fog deposition + residual moisture/refreeze), which raises delay odds more than closure odds. News/outage context (Kent County elevated outages) is noted, but there’s no evidence yet of a concentrated outage impacting Rockford school facilities, and no Monday closure wave is posted. Web verification did NOT find any ≤ -20°F wind chill for Monday morning (so the extreme-cold automatic rule is not triggered). \n\nRecommendation: probability of a FULL snow day/closure is low, but a 2-hour delay is a plausible contingency if near-zero visibility or widespread slickness is observed on early route checks.",

That combination almost always supports normal school operations. I keep the probability above ~0–1% mainly because the visibility fields (0–1 mi around ~7–10 AM in the dataset) and high humidity suggest possible dense fog/low stratus, and because subfreezing temps can allow patchy black ice even without active precipitation. Those hazards can force a *delay* if widespread at 6–7 AM, but a full snow day/closure remains unlikely."

Historically, in Rockford/Kent County, a dry overcast day with light winds and temps in the 20s to near freezing almost always runs normally. The only meaningful lever upward is the forecasted near-zero visibility at/near bus time; dense fog can create a safety-driven delay or (rarely) a cancellation if it is widespread and persistent across rural routes. With no snow forecast and no clear ice event forecast on Feb 9 itself, the base-rate for a full closure remains very low; most “surprise” closures on days like this come from non-meteorological or residual-impacts factors (localized power/facility issues, unanticipated black ice reports from first routes)."

Those conditions rarely justify a full closure by themselves. The only factor that could credibly elevate risk enough to change operations is widespread dense fog (near-zero visibility) right at bus pickup time, potentially compounded by patchy black ice on untreated rural roads/bridge decks. Even if that verifies, districts typically choose a 1–2 hour delay, staggered start, or temporary bus hold—so I keep full snow-day probability low but non-zero."

That supports that the region *had* impactful weather, but it doesn’t by itself imply a Monday closure, especially with no Monday storm signal and no already-posted widespread closings. The remaining closure risk comes from tail risks: localized lingering power issues affecting specific buildings/transportation, or a surprise visibility/black-ice problem at bus time that pushes a delay decision. Net: very low probability of a full snow day; small but real chance of delay/partial disruption."
