Winds are not extreme locally (~10–16 mph) but cold wind chills near -10 to -15°F add safety/transport concerns. Given Michigan’s snow tolerance, the deciding factor is ice + timing: precip continues into/through the morning commute (ends closer to midday), making plow/road-treatment effectiveness lower.

For Rockford, that combination typically points to an elevated chance of a delay and a moderate chance of cancellation if (a) lake-effect bands linger near daybreak, (b) roads are still snow-covered, or (c) even a thin glaze develops on untreated surfaces.

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement: All four inputs converge that the biggest Tuesday-morning risk is NOT heavy new snow at Rockford, but hazardous travel from (a) lingering lake-effect impacts nearby and (b) ice/glaze potential at very cold temperatures during the commute window.\n2) Disagreement: Meteorology shows very low point snowfall (~0.16\") while the NWS warning describes higher regional totals. Meteorologist clarified this is banding/region-max wording; Rockford could stay between bands yet still have high-impact icing. Visibility risk is episodic (brief band-driven drops), not guaranteed sustained whiteout.\n3) Plow timing math: Safety analyst confirms precip is still occurring at 07:00–08:00 with worst conditions through ~08:30. That leaves ~0 hours of true “snow ends, then plow” buffer before a 07:40 start; primaries can be maintained, but secondaries/bus routes likely remain slick.\n4) Any ice? Yes—high ice formation risk, with a likely transition from light snow to light freezing drizzle/freezing rain around 8 AM at ~0–3°F. This is the main closure driver.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Tuesday closures/delays were found in the updated crawl for Rockford or nearby districts; thus no +15–20% ‘domino closure’ bump. Regional road-safety headlines are strong, but not the same as confirmed school decisions.\n6) What would make me wrong?\n- WRONG LOW (actual closure): if a lake-effect band sets up over Rockford near daybreak producing much worse visibility/drifting than the point forecast, or if early AM crash/slide-off rates spike on feeder roads due to glaze.\n- WRONG HIGH (stays open): if freezing drizzle doesn’t materialize (only flurries) and overnight treatment leaves even secondary roads mostly black/clear by 6–7 AM.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive)\n- Meteorology (35%): Mixed precip with freezing drizzle risk during 7–9 AM + very cold temps; warning through 7 AM = elevated morning hazard.\n- Safety (25%): High ice risk; worst 01:00–08:30; explicit lack of treatment window before 7:40 and secondary-road weakness.\n- History (20%): Similar setups often produce delays/cancellations driven by travel hazard type (ice/banding) more than totals; Michigan tolerance lowers pure-snow closure odds.\n- News intel (20%): Strong regional hazard signals (I-196 pileup), but NO confirmed Tuesday district closures/delays for Rockford/nearby in the check → keeps probability from jumping into the 60%+ range.\n\nBOTTOM LINE CALL\nGiven Michigan’s higher tolerance and the lack of confirmed neighboring-district Tuesday closures, a FULL cancellation is not the most likely outcome. However, ice + active precip during the start window makes a DELAY quite plausible. I therefore set snow-day (closure) probability at 32% (leaning toward delay/modified start as the more likely operational choice).",
