Temperatures remain near/below freezing (mid‑20s overnight rising to low‑mid 30s), but forecast precipitation is essentially zero with 0% modeled chance of snow and no measurable rain/snow shown. Roads will stay cold but dry. \n\nThe main issue is visibility, not snow or ice: dense fog and periods of freezing fog are indicated from late afternoon through the night, with model visibility occasionally dropping to near 0 miles and remaining reduced (1–3 miles) at times. Winds are modest (generally 5–13 mph, gusts to ~19 mph) and won’t cause blowing snow problems. No freezing rain, accumulating snow, or significant mixed precipitation is shown.\n\nMichigan schools generally stay open for cold and overcast days like this unless visibility becomes dangerously poor right at the bus commute times or an unforecast icing event develops. Based strictly on this data, the probability of a full snow day cancellation on Monday is very low; at most, there’s a small risk of localized delays if real‑world fog becomes denser than modeled during the morning or evening transportation windows."

Historically, Rockford‑area schools close for combinations of heavy snow (often 8–10\"+ with poor timing), significant ice storms, blizzard conditions, or dangerous wind chills below about -15°F. This day resembles the many ordinary midwinter days when schools operate normally. The main operational concern is localized slick spots from freezing fog and any residual compacted snow/ice from prior days, which could justify extra caution but, by historical standards, not a full cancellation. Overall confidence in a ‘school as usual’ outcome is high, acknowledging that districts can still issue rare delays if fog becomes more extensive and visibility drops more than currently indicated."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT VS. DISAGREEMENT\n- Meteorologist: Quiet weather day – cold, foggy at times, but 0% snow probability and no accumulating precip. Clearly states forecast does NOT support a traditional snow day.\n- Historian: Very low historical snow-day rates (1–3%) for nearly identical setups (cold, gray, maybe foggy, no storm). High confidence in “school as usual.”\n- Safety Analyst: Road scores of 8–9/10, low overall risk, and explicitly says a delay or closure is not indicated. Morning commute impact: minimal.\n- News/Intel: District calendar and announcements show a normal return. No neighboring districts have pre-announced closures or delays. Community sentiment is weather-watching but not “this is a major storm.”\n\nAll four are aligned: conditions are routine for west Michigan winter and do not support a closure.\n\nNo material conflicts:\n- The only nuance is that meteorology flags dense/freezing fog possible late day and overnight, while safety notes morning visibility is still good (6–10 miles) with main fog concerns later. That’s timing nuance, not a contradiction.\n\n2. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- New snow forecast: 0\". No overnight or morning snow, so there is effectively nothing new to plow ahead of the school day.\n- Road work is limited to scraping/treating residual compacted snow/ice from previous events and pre-treating for any later freezing fog.\n- With no active accumulation, plow timing relative to a snow end time is irrelevant; roads are already in high condition (8–9/10) going into the morning. From a “snow end → 7:40 AM” perspective, it’s effectively infinite hours of lead time.\n\n3. ICE / FREEZING RISK\n- Temps: mid-20s overnight, upper 20s around commute, rising into low–mid 30s later.\n- Meteorology: no freezing rain; precip type is technically “mixed” but with zero measurable precip. Main concern is freezing fog creating thin glaze on some surfaces.\n- Safety: labels ice formation risk as “moderate” but still rates roads and lots 8–9/10; warns about localized black ice on bridges/untreated secondary roads and suggests salting lots/sidewalks, especially for evening.\n\nThere is some patchy ice risk, but not a true “ice event” (no storm, no widespread glazing, no advisory-level icing). Under the Michigan thresholds given, this is far below the kind of ice that pushes probabilities into the 60%+ range.\n\n4. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- Rockford: Official calendar simply says “School Resumes” Jan 5; no conditional language, no snow-day posts.\n- Neighboring districts checked (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD): no closure or delay postings yet for Jan 5.\n- Local media: covering an active winter pattern and earlier storms, but nothing tying Jan 5 specifically to likely closures.\n- Social/Community sentiment: best described as uncertain/normal weather-watching, not confidently expecting a closure.\n\nPer the weighting rules: no neighboring closures → no +15–20% bump; no strong “we’re definitely closing” buzz → no +10–15% bump.\n\n5. WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (WITH REQUIRED WEIGHTS)\nBase expert-derived probabilities before weighting:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Given 0\" snow, no precip, routine cold, but some fog: about 3–5% chance of a surprise fog-based delay/closure. I’ll assign 4%.\n- Safety (25% weight): With high road scores and explicit statement that no delay/closure is indicated: ~3% (allowing for rare surprises like unexpected dense freezing fog on key routes).\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs show 1–3% snow-day rate. Take 2%.\n- News/Intel (20% weight): All signals show normal operation, no preemptive closures, no neighboring shutdowns. That supports something like 2–4%; use 3% to reflect tiny chance of late-breaking decision.\n\nWeighted blend:\n0.35*4% + 0.25*3% + 0.20*2% + 0.20*3% \n= 1.4% + 0.75% + 0.4% + 0.6% ≈ 3.15%.\n\nMichigan baseline thresholds say:<4\" snow → 5–15%. Here we have 0\" snow and no storm; that justifies going *below* even the 5% lower bound.\n\nAdjustments:\n- No snow, no storm system, no advisories: push lower end.\n- Some freezing fog/black ice risk, plus Michigan sometimes reacts to surprise fog → nudge up slightly from pure historical minimums.\n- No neighboring closures, no strong buzz → no upward community adjustment.\n\nRounded competitive forecast: 6% snow-day probability.\nThis is slightly conservative (above the ~3% raw blend) to account for unmodeled last-minute issues (e.g., a denser-than-forecast fog bank exactly at bus time).\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS FORECAST WRONG?\nYou’d likely be wrong (i.e., an actual closure happens) only if:\n- A stronger-than-forecast freezing fog/black ice event develops over a wide area right before the morning commute, dropping visibility to near zero and glazing many roads suddenly; or\n- A late-developing band of lake-effect or clipper snow sets up over Rockford overnight, adding several inches with bad timing that are *not* in the current guidance; or\n- There is a non-weather operational issue (power outage, heating failure, large accident closing key routes) coinciding with the morning.\n\nGiven current data and expert consensus, those are low-probability edge cases consistent with a single-digit risk.\n\n7. COMPETITION / BRIER SCORE STRATEGY\n- The environment is strongly signaling “school open.”\n- Using a very low but non-zero probability (6%) balances decisiveness with the reality that closures are never literally impossible.\n- Avoiding the 40–60% middle ground is appropriate here because experts are not split; all four align on low risk.\n\nFinal call: ~6% chance of a snow day (closure or full weather-related cancellation) on Monday, January 5, 2026 in Rockford, MI.
