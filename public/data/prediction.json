Snow amounts are negligible (~0.04\") and the main concern is any light freezing rain/drizzle early (even tiny amounts can create slick patches, especially on untreated roads/bridges given subfreezing temps all day). However, with such low QPF (~0.01\") and improving conditions by mid-morning (sunny, vis ~6 mi), widespread travel disruption is unlikely. Snow-day potential: LOW; if there is a delay/closure risk, it would be driven by a brief early-morning glaze/black ice rather than snowfall."

    "decision_rationale": "Checklist synthesis (weighted):\n1) Agreement across experts: Snow accumulation is negligible; the real risk is a thin glaze/black ice after midnight plus extreme cold. Most experts lean “open / maybe delay,” not a classic snow day.\n2) Disagreements: Wind chill is the key conflict. WeatherAPI suggests sub -20°F is NOT met near start time, but Web Verifier confirms Weather.com hourly shows -25°F to -26°F at 6–8 AM. NWS point confirmation wasn’t obtainable in-session, so this remains unresolved → lowers confidence and keeps probability from dropping too low.\n3) Plow timing math: precip/icing ends ~12:30 AM → ~6.0 hours until 6:30 AM bus time and ~7.2 hours until ~7:40 AM start. That generally favors OPEN, but extreme cold reduces salt performance; infrastructure expects primary roads serviceable but secondary/local roads patchy/slick at daybreak.\n4) Ice? Yes, at least a credible light freezing rain/drizzle signal. Even 0.01\" liquid can create high-impact black ice in subzero air temps.\n5) Neighboring districts: No confirmed Fri 1/30 closures/delays found. Earlier-week closures/delays exist but are not strong same-day signals → no +15–20% bump.\n6) Power: Outages are minimal (17 customers; 99.99% with power). No evidence of school-feeder outages → no meaningful bump.\n7) Wind chill verification: Weather.com hourly alone clearly crosses ≤ -20°F during bus time; other available sources are closer to -18 to -25 regionally but not point-confirmed. Because only one point-verified source crosses the hard threshold, I do not treat this as a near-automatic closure; I treat it as a material tail risk.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) If wind chills really are in the -20s at 6–8 AM and the district enforces a hard cutoff, closure odds jump sharply; (b) If a thin glaze is more widespread than expected on secondary roads/bridges/hills, buses may not safely run (delay/closure).\n\nWeighting used (per directive): Meteorology 25% (low snow, light icing), Safety 25% (moderate risk on secondaries), History 15% (glaze more often delay than closure), News 15% (no current closure signals), Infrastructure 10% (serviceable primaries by 6:15–6:30; patchy local roads), Power 5% (minimal outages), Web verifier 5% (flags sub -20°F risk but conflicting).

Low-lying areas\nalong the Muskegon River that are prone to flooding may see\nrapidly changing water levels as ice shifts and adjusts.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 418 PM EST, an ice jam continues to be reported by local\nauthorities on the Muskegon river in southern Newaygo County.\nThe river gauge at Newaygo shows water levels remaining at\nminor flood stage as of Wednesday afternoon.\n- As the river freezes up, ice can restrict the flow of the\nriver and cause rises and falls in water level. While\nflooding associated with freeze up ice jams is typically\nminor, conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably.\n- Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNewaygo.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\n",
