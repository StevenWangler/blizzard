    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Wednesday 2026-01-07, conditions are cold, damp, and gray but largely quiet. Temperatures hover around 31–32°F from midnight through the morning bus window, then slowly rise into the mid-30s by afternoon. Winds are light to moderate (generally 5–10 mph from the W–WSW), producing wind chills in the mid-20s°F. Importantly, there is no measurable precipitation forecast: total precip and snowfall are both 0, and model guidance shows no active snow bands or freezing rain on Wednesday. The main concern is freezing fog from roughly 5 AM through late morning, with localized visibility reductions to about 1 mile (some model points even show near-zero vis at times), and temperatures at or just below freezing. This could allow patchy black ice or a thin glaze to persist on untreated surfaces, especially after Tuesday’s earlier icing event in the region, but there is no new accumulating snow or significant ice expected during school hours. Roads in West Michigan are well-equipped to handle this level of cold and fog, and with plows not needed and winds modest, the overall impact is limited to localized slick spots and some visibility issues at daybreak. From a Michigan snow-day standpoint—where closures typically require several inches of new snow, widespread ice, or an ongoing storm—these conditions are not strong enough to warrant a full closure. At most, districts might consider minor caution or isolated bus route adjustments, but the probabilistic signal strongly favors a normal school day. Overall assessment: low impact winter weather, low likelihood of snow day for Wednesday."

Freezing fog around the morning commute is the main concern, yet visibility and wind projections suggest it will be manageable. Overall, the historical pattern strongly favors school being open on Wednesday with only a low probability that Rockford Public Schools would call a snow/ice day based on these conditions."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENT\n- Meteorology: No measurable snow or freezing rain is forecast overnight or during the Jan 7 school day. Main issues: freezing fog, temps near 31°F, some patchy residual ice from the prior day.\n- History: Analog patterns (post-icing but quiet, freezing fog, temps 30–35°F, no active storm) yield only ~5–10% historical snow-day frequency in Rockford and similar West Michigan districts.\n- Safety: Road scores are relatively good (primary 8/10, secondary 7/10, parking lots 7/10). Risk is described as moderate, driven by patchy black ice and visibility reductions between ~5–10 AM, not by widespread hazardous conditions. Afternoon impact is minimal.\n- News/Intel: NWS and TV forecasts emphasize a quiet, mild pattern with no storm for Jan 7. Rockford and neighboring districts show no closure/delay alerts. Community/social media sentiment is essentially \"no buzz.\" There is no domino pattern of neighboring closures.\nAll four agree: this is a low‑impact, routine winter day with some localized slickness and fog, not a classic Michigan snow‑day setup.\n\n2. ANY CONFLICTS?\n- Safety labels risk as \"moderate\" for the morning commute due to patchy black ice and fog. Meteorology and history still frame this as typical winter nuisance conditions. That’s not a true conflict—just different emphasis: safety is appropriately conservative about early-morning driving, while the other experts emphasize overall storm absence.\n- No expert suggests high closure likelihood. Meteorology explicitly calls snow‑day likelihood low; history’s analog rates are 5–10%; safety suggests mitigation steps but not closure; news/community intel sees no closure momentum.\nGiven the alignment, there’s no need to adjust using cross-check tools.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- There is effectively no new snow overnight, so plow operations are minimal and focused on salting/sanding residual ice and known slick spots.\n- Worst conditions window: ~5–10 AM (freezing fog, patchy black ice). Assuming a typical high‑school bus window around 6:30–7:40 AM:\n  • There are many hours between the end of Tuesday’s advisory conditions (early afternoon Jan 6) and the morning commute on Jan 7 for crews to treat roads.\n  • With no fresh accumulation to push, road crews can focus purely on de-icing trouble spots before buses roll.\n- Net: Plow/salt timing is favorable; there is no backlog of snow to clear ahead of the school day.\n\n4. ICE RISK ASSESSMENT\n- Ice is present only as a residual/patchy issue:\n  • Prior day (Jan 6) saw light icing in nearby counties; Wednesday has no new advisory for Rockford.\n  • Temperatures are around 30–32°F with high humidity and freezing fog from about 5–10 AM, which can maintain or create slick patches on untreated surfaces (bridges, shaded curves, walkways).\n  • However, there is no signal for widespread, actively accumulating freezing rain or an ice storm.\n- In the Michigan thresholds provided, ice that decisively affects snow-day odds is usually a broad, ongoing event. Here we have localized, manageable ice risk, not system-wide hazardous glazing.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS & COMMUNITY SIGNALS\n- News intel shows:\n  • Rockford Public Schools: no closure or delay alerts for Jan 7 as of the latest checks.\n  • Forest Hills and other nearby districts (Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) likewise show no weather-related announcements.\n  • Regional closing lists show no Kent County–wide winter storm headline for that date.\n  • Social media sentiment is \"no_buzz\"—community not expecting a closure; no surge of posts about terrible roads or power outages.\n- Per the decision rules: No neighboring districts closed and no strong expectation of closure → no positive adjustment. In fact, lack of buzz slightly reinforces the low end of the probability range.\n\n6. QUANTITATIVE WEIGHTING\nUsing the specified expert weights:\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly points to low impact and essentially 0\" new snow, no active storm. On its own, this would suggest ~3–8% closure probability.\n- Safety (25% weight): Labels commute risk \"moderate\" but with high road scores and clear mitigation steps short of closure. This nudges probability slightly upward from a pure-meteorology view, to perhaps ~8–12%.\n- History (20% weight): Historical analogs give 5–10% closure odds. This supports staying near the low end of the Michigan threshold range for non-storm days.\n- News/Intel (20% weight, \"secret weapon\"): Shows no neighboring closures and no expectation of a storm or closure. This pushes us to the bottom of the plausible range rather than the middle, counteracting any temptation to overreact to the word \"ice.\"\nCombined, these inputs comfortably cluster around ~5–10%. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for routine winter conditions and the absence of a storm, I select 5% to stay sharp for Brier scoring and reflect the strong consensus against closure.\n\n7. ALIGNMENT WITH MICHIGAN THRESHOLDS\n- Snowfall: 0\" → below even the <4\" category, which already suggests only 5–15% in this region.\n- No blizzard, no active ice storm, no 8\"+ accumulation, no extreme wind chills.\n- Conditions are best described as a typical, slightly slick winter morning with fog—well below the usual bar for Michigan snow days.\n\n8. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\nThe main failure mode would be an unforeseen deterioration in conditions between now and early morning:\n- If freezing fog becomes much denser than forecast (e.g., widespread visibilities <1/4 mile) and persists right through the commute, causing a spike in accidents.\n- If unexpected freezing drizzle or light freezing rain redevelops near dawn, leading to more widespread black ice than anticipated.\n- If multiple neighboring districts were to announce closures or major delays late at night or early morning based on on-the-ground observations, signaling a regional step-change in hazard level.\nThese are low-probability contingencies but justify an early-morning recheck.\n\n9. FINAL DECISION\nGiven the strong four-way agreement: no active storm, limited and localized ice risk, good road readiness, and no regional closure momentum, the most accurate prediction is that Rockford Public Schools will hold a normal school day on Wednesday, Jan 7, 2026. I assign a 5% probability of a snow/ice day (closure or significant delay) and 95% probability of school operating on time.\n",
