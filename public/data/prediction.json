Temperatures stay below freezing overnight (around 20–23°F at bus time) and rise to near 33°F in the afternoon, with no forecast precipitation and no snow or ice accumulation expected. Winds are modest (generally 5–12 mph) with minor wind chill in the teens to low 20s °F. Visibility briefly dips to about 1 mile due to mist/low clouds around the morning and midafternoon, but overall remains adequate for travel. There are no weather alerts and no impactful snow or ice. From a Michigan school-operations standpoint, this setup is routine winter cold with dry roads, so the meteorological risk for a snow day or weather-related closure on Monday is effectively near zero."

Historically, Rockford/Grand Rapids-area schools almost never close under such conditions, especially absent a storm or extreme cold headline. Comparing to past late-December patterns, this day falls squarely in the “schools run on normal schedule” category. Overall confidence that there would NOT be a snow day based on weather alone is high."

    "decision_rationale": "1. Expert agreement\n- Meteorologist: Quiet, dry, cold day; no snow or ice, no alerts; explicitly states snow-day risk is near zero.\n- Historian: Past patterns with nearly identical conditions have effectively 0% snow-day rate; Rockford does not close for this level of cold alone.\n- Safety analyst: Roads generally in good shape, low risk; only minor patchy refreeze possible; conditions do not warrant delay or closure.\n- News intel: Confirms NO SCHOOL on Dec 22 is due to scheduled Winter Break, not a storm. No current storm-related closure chatter or alerts.\nAll four align that weather is not closure-level and that operations risk is very low.\n\n2. Conflicts\nThere are no substantive conflicts:\n- All agree on: no new snow, no ice event, no storm impacts, and routine travel conditions for Michigan.\n- Safety lists a moderate ice formation risk in one field, but the narrative clarifies this as isolated refreeze spots, not a systemic ice event. This is consistent with a low overall risk.\nThus, there is no meaningful disagreement needing tool clarification.\n\n3. Plow timing math (hours from snow end to 7:40 AM)\n- Meteorological analysis: 0% probability of overnight or morning snow; total snowfall 0\".\n- Therefore, there is no active or recent storm tied to this forecast period; plow timing is effectively irrelevant for this day.\n- Any prior snow has already been handled; by 7:40 AM, roads are in standard winter-maintained condition with many hours (likely days) since the last impactful snow.\n\n4. Ice risk\n- No freezing rain, mixed precip, or new melt–refreeze cycle is forecast.\n- Temperatures remain below freezing (around 20–25°F near bus time) with dry conditions.\n- Safety notes only patchy black ice potential on residual damp spots, typical for winter but not closure-level.\nConclusion: There is no organized ice event; just routine localized slick spots.\n\n5. Neighboring districts\n- News intel lists earlier coordinated closures (Dec 9–12) for Rockford, Cedar Springs, Forest Hills, Lowell during a prior storm.\n- Crucially, there are no fresh neighboring-district closure announcements for Dec 22 tied to weather; Dec 22 is simply Winter Break in Rockford.\n- Therefore, the +15–20% bump for 3+ neighboring districts closing for this event does NOT apply.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- A sudden, unforecast overnight storm (snow or ice) that develops after this analysis, bringing several inches or significant icing before the commute.\n- A last-minute district operational issue (e.g., major power failure or infrastructure problem) unrelated to the forecast.\nGiven the forecast’s dryness and typical operations, these are low-probability edge cases.\n\n7. Weighting of experts (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Indicates essentially 0% closure risk based on weather; contributes a base probability ~0–5% to account for rare surprises.\n- Safety (25%): Low risk; roads/walking manageable with minor caution. Supports keeping probability at the low end (~5–10%).\n- History (20%): Historical snow-day rate for this setup is basically 0%. Pulls the estimate toward the floor.\n- News intelligence (20%): Secret weapon here: confirms no current storm-driven closure wave, and that Dec 22 is pre-scheduled Winter Break. Since the question is about a *weather-related* snow day, and there is no weather-driven closure signal, news intel reinforces a very low probability, not a bump.\n\n8. Translating to a final probability\nMichigan thresholds suggest:\n- With 0\" new snow and no ice, the baseline should be at or below the lowest band (<4\" ⇒ 5–15%).\n- All signals point to routine winter conditions with no storm, so I choose the very bottom of that band.\n- To avoid an unrealistic 0% (because unforecast events are possible), I set:\n  snow_day_probability = 5%.\n\nThis balances decisiveness for Brier scoring with a realistic, non-zero tail-risk. Confidence is very high because all four expert domains independently converge on “normal school day conditions” and there is no live storm or district buzz to contradict that.",
