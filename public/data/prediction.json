    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford, MI on Wednesday, 2025-12-31, this looks like a COLD but fairly routine post-event winter day for West Michigan schools, not a classic snow day setup. The impactful wintry weather (moderate to heavy snow and some blowing snow) occurs mainly Tuesday evening (Dec 30) through shortly after midnight. By the critical pre-school window (roughly 4–7 AM Wednesday), the forecast shows overcast skies, no new snow, temperatures in the mid‑20s °F, and WNW winds 10–15 mph with wind chills around the low teens. Total new accumulation from the late-Tuesday/early-Wednesday event appears to be on the order of about 0.5\"; significant additional accumulation is not expected during the school day. Roads could be slick and snow‑covered from the prior evening’s snow and freezing rain, but with no ongoing heavy precipitation and only moderate winds, local road crews in Kent County will likely be able to clear main routes before bus runs. Visibility improves from ~1 mi during heavier snow around midnight to 4–6 mi through the morning commute. There are no alerts posted, winds are below advisory thresholds, and temperatures, while cold, are typical for late December. In a Michigan district accustomed to 4–6\"+ events and frequent snow, this pattern supports a low probability of a full snow day on Wednesday. Some minor delays or localized issues are possible if plowing lags on side roads, but meteorologically this is a standard winter school day rather than a closure-level storm."

    "confidence_assessment": "For Wednesday, 2025-12-31, the forecast for Rockford, Michigan shows a transition day after a more active wintry period on Tuesday. Key school-day hours (around 5–9 AM) feature temperatures in the mid‑20s°F, wind 10–18 mph from the WNW, overcast to cloudy skies, and only very light precip amounts with no meaningful new accumulation indicated (totalsnow_cm = 0 for the day, totalprecip ≈ 0.09\"). Some blowing snow and reduced visibility are possible very late Tuesday night to around 1 AM, but conditions trend toward just cloudy/overcast with typical winter cold by the commute. Wind chills during the school day are generally in the single digits to low teens above zero, well above the extreme cold closure threshold (~-15°F wind chill). There is no indication of an ice storm, blizzard-level winds, or a heavy-timing 8–10\"+ snowfall event directly impacting the Wednesday morning window. Historically, Rockford/Kent County schools nearly always remain open under this type of pattern: light lingering snow or flurries, routine cold, and manageable winds. While some slick spots are likely from prior mixed precipitation on Tuesday, road crews have an overnight window to treat and plow, and visibility improves compared to the prior night. Based on these factors and historical patterns for late December in this area, the likelihood of a full snow day on Wednesday, 2025-12-31 is low, with a somewhat elevated but still modest chance of localized delays in specific trouble spots rather than district-wide closure."

Neighboring Kent ISD districts and programs largely follow similar holiday schedules, and no special closure announcements for Dec. 31 have been posted yet.\n\nHowever, National Weather Service guidance relayed by multiple Michigan outlets indicates West Michigan—including the Rockford/Grand Rapids region—faces continued snow, strong winds (gusts up to ~50–55 mph), and hazardous travel conditions from Tuesday into Wednesday, Dec. 31, following a post‑Christmas ice event. Consumers Energy is already managing more than a thousand outages mainly north of Kent County, and warns of ongoing restoration work and safety precautions as the snow and wind continue.\n\nCommunity and district communications are focused on general winter‑weather procedures (text alerts, TV listings, and website updates) rather than a specific closure for Dec. 31, reflecting that school is not in session.

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: Only about 0.5\" of new snow with the main burst Tuesday evening into shortly after midnight. By 4–7 AM Wednesday, no active accumulating snow, just cold, breezy, overcast.\n- Safety: Worst travel conditions 10 PM–2 AM. By 6–8 AM, primary and secondary roads are expected to be mostly clear with typical winter slick spots. Morning and afternoon commute impacts rated minimal.\n- History: Comparable past patterns in the Rockford/Grand Rapids area—post‑event flurries, mid‑20s temps, winds 10–20 mph—produce very low snow‑day rates (~3–8%). Michigan districts typically stay open unless there is heavy snow, serious ice, or extreme cold.\n- News/Intel: Confirms that Rockford Public Schools and most neighboring districts are on Winter Break with no classes Dec 31; there is no planned academic day to cancel. NWS messaging highlights hazardous travel mainly earlier in the week and through Tuesday/early Wednesday, but not a targeted school‑day snow‑day scenario for Rockford.\n\nAll four agree this is a routine cold winter day *for a school day*, and in reality Dec 31 is already a non‑school day.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS / TENSIONS\n- Meteorological & safety detail vs. some broader media headlines: NWS‑based articles talk about hazardous travel and strong winds continuing into Wednesday, but the localized forecast and safety analysis for Rockford’s specific morning window show improving conditions, modest winds (10–17 mph rather than sustained 50 mph), and light/no new snow.\n- This is resolved by weighting the targeted, hour‑by‑hour local forecast and the safety analyst more heavily than generalized regional headlines.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH\n- Worst conditions: 2025‑12‑30T22:00 to 2025‑12‑31T02:00.\n- Typical first‑bell / bus window: around 7:40 AM start, buses 6:00–7:40 AM.\n- Time between worst conditions ending (02:00) and first bell (07:40): about 5.5 hours.\n- That window is ample for Kent County and city crews, especially with only ~0.5\" of new snow and no ongoing heavy precip. This strongly favors normal operations over closure.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Safety analyst flags ice formation risk as \"moderate\" from prior mixed precip, mainly on bridges, overpasses, and untreated side streets.\n- However, there is **no active freezing rain** in the pre‑school window, temperatures stay in the 20s (not going above and back below freezing multiple times), and crews can salt overnight.\n- This is not a classic ice‑storm setup; elevated but manageable slickness, not district‑wide paralyzing ice.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS\n- News/Intel: Neighboring districts and Kent ISD programs largely share holiday schedules; no Dec 31 weather‑driven snow‑day announcements are posted as of the afternoon of Dec 30.\n- Because most are already on break, we cannot get the usual ‘domino effect’ of 3+ neighbors closing for weather. There is therefore no +15–20% upward adjustment from regional closures.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG?\n- Forecast bust where:\n  - Snow continues into the early morning with much higher rates than 0.5\" total, e.g., a surprise 4–6\" band peaking 3–7 AM.\n  - Unforeseen significant icing occurs overnight (e.g., more freezing rain than modeled), turning secondary roads and hills into sheet ice by morning.\n  - Winds verify much stronger locally (frequent 40–50 mph gusts) creating true whiteout conditions and large drifts at bus‑time.\n- Given the consistency between meteorology, safety, and history, and lack of strong signals of these extremes, these failure modes are low‑probability but worth monitoring.\n\n7. PROBABILITY CALCULATION & WEIGHTING\nBase on Michigan thresholds:\n- Expected new snow <1\" with no accumulation during school hours → in the 5–15% range.\n- No blizzard, no major ice, and no extreme cold → stays near the low end of closure risk.\n\nWeighting experts:\n- Meteorology (35%): Strongly indicates a routine cold day post‑event; this alone suggests ~5–10% snow‑day risk.\n- Safety (25%): Rates morning impact as minimal and roads mostly clear by commute; consistent with ~5–10% closure likelihood.\n- History (20%): Analog days show ~3–8% closure; I take ~6% from this input.\n- News/Intel (20%): Secret‑weapon factor. Confirms Winter Break (no scheduled school) and no neighbor weather closures yet. Community sentiment is \"uncertain\" but not strongly pushing for closure. Since there is no operational school day, practical ‘snow day’ decision probability effectively rounds near zero, but to stay in the framework of “if school *were* in session under these conditions,” it supports a low single‑digit to low‑teens percentage.\n\nCombining these and aligning to the Michigan guideline band for <4\" events, I set the final **snow day probability at 8%** with **high confidence**. That keeps us out of the 40–60% no‑man’s land, is consistent with historical data, and acknowledges a small residual risk if conditions end up worse than forecast.\n\n8. SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT THIS DATE\n- Rockford Public Schools: On Winter Break through Jan 4; there is **no actual snow‑day call** to be made for Dec 31.\n- This prediction should be interpreted as: if Dec 31 were a normal school day under these forecast conditions, the chance of an official weather closure would be about 8%, and the more realistic operational question would be minor delays or just normal school with caution—not a full closure.",
