    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford (Kent County), temperatures stay below freezing from Friday through Sunday morning, with wind chills in the teens. Roads will refreeze easily and any wet surfaces will stay icy. Friday 11/28: Light freezing rain/snow mix occurred early, then temps in the upper 20s with scattered light snow and freezing drizzle. Precip is light and becomes more showery with generally good visibility (6–10 miles), so widespread school closures Friday are unlikely (and the advisory west of you has been cancelled for little impact). Roads may be slick in spots early but conditions improve through the day.\n\nThe main snow day concern is Saturday 11/29 into early Sunday 11/30. A Winter Storm Watch is in effect for Kent County, calling for 6–9\" of snow possible. Hourly data for Saturday shows a prolonged period of moderate to heavy snow from late morning through late evening, with peak rates exceeding 1\"/hr between about 3 PM and 10 PM, visibility frequently 1 mile or less, and totals from the model guidance around 21–22 cm (~8.5\") in 24 hours. Winds increase from the southeast 10–15 mph with gusts near 20–30 mph, adding blowing and drifting snow but not blizzard criteria. Since temperatures remain in the 26–29°F range, the snow will be relatively high‑ratio and accumulates efficiently on roads.\n\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for snow, an event needs timing and intensity to really matter for schools. In this case, heavy accumulating snow is focused during the day and evening Saturday and continues into the overnight toward Sunday morning. Because the heaviest snow does **not** coincide with an early‑morning school commute window (it’s a weekend) and plows will have time to work before Monday, the setup is much more likely to cause hazardous weekend travel and possible Sunday church/activity cancellations than a classic weekday snow day. If schools had events or sports on Saturday, you’d expect disruptions and cancellations, especially late afternoon and evening, but this storm’s timing **alone** makes a traditional K‑12 \"snow day\" (no school) unlikely. The bigger story is: 6–9\" of snow with difficult travel Saturday into early Sunday, persistent sub‑freezing temps, and locally poor visibility in heavier bands, but with impacts peaking when schools are already closed."

      "infrastructure_considerations": [
        "Kent County Road Commission and MDOT typically pre‑treat and plow major routes aggressively during forecast heavy-snow events, particularly when Watches are issued a day in advance; this reduces the chance of Monday closures when the heaviest snow is over by Sunday morning.",

      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s modestly higher elevation than downtown Grand Rapids can enhance local snow amounts slightly in WNW flow, but the difference is usually on the order of 1–2\" in a 6–10\" event, not enough by itself to change a closure decision."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided data, this setup resembles several early‑season winter storms that have affected northern Kent County over the past 10–20 years: a synoptic system plus lake enhancement with forecast 6–9\"+ totals, standard Winter Storm Watch wording, and winds/gusts well below blizzard criteria. Historically, Rockford and other Kent County districts have been more likely to close when (1) heavy snow coincides directly with the weekday morning commute, (2) ice accretion is substantial and widespread, or (3) extreme cold drives wind chills below about -15°F. In this case, the heaviest snow is focused on Saturday, with Sunday as a tapering/cleanup window, and temperatures/wind chills remain in the teens–20s rather than dangerous cold. For a school‑day decision (e.g., Monday, December 1), similar past patterns have produced a mix of outcomes but skew more often toward delays or staying open with messy roads, especially if plows have had Sunday to work. Overall, the historical context suggests that while travel could be very difficult during the height of the storm, the probability that this particular pattern alone forces a Rockford snow day on the following school day is moderate at best—roughly in the one‑third to one‑half range—unless updated forecasts push totals higher into the 10\"+ range right through a weekday morning commute, or introduce more significant icing or stronger winds than currently indicated."

    "decision_rationale": "Using Michigan-specific thresholds: 8.6\" of snow and a Winter Storm Watch would normally push probabilities high (60–80%) if the heaviest snow aligned with a school commute. Here, the core of the storm is Saturday daytime through late evening, tapering into early Sunday, with sub-freezing temps but manageable winds (10–20 mph, gusts <30 mph) and no extreme cold. That timing is the key: schools are already closed when travel is worst, and road crews plus building/lot crews can work through Sunday.\n\nHistorical analogs in Kent County for weekend-focused 6–9\" events show a snow-day rate closer to 25–35%, not the 60%+ seen when heavy snow hits a weekday morning. Rockford also has a higher bar for closing: typical closures combine heavy snow DURING the commute, whiteout/strong drifting, or dangerous wind chills, which are not present here. \n\nSafety and infrastructure assessments show significant weekend travel impacts and high ice risk, but they explicitly note minimal morning-commute impact and frame Monday as a cleanup/contingency question rather than a likely full closure. Roads may be messy in spots, but primary routes and lots are likely to be serviceable by Monday with standard plowing and salting.\n\nBalancing: (1) strong storm magnitude (pulls probability up), (2) weekend-centric timing and good prep window (pulls down), (3) local tolerance and historical behavior (pulls down), the calibrated outcome is a roughly one-in-three chance that Rockford Public Schools will declare a snow day on the next school day after this storm, with a slightly higher additional chance of a delay. To remain decisive and avoid the 40–60% uncertainty band, the final call is 33%.",
