Temperatures stay below freezing through the morning (around 29°F at 6–7 AM) so ANY freezing drizzle is a big deal. Snow amounts from this specific hourly forecast are light (~0.7\"), but the NWS advisory calls for a broader 2–4\" with a light glaze, and explicitly highlights freezing drizzle overnight into early Friday plus snow redeveloping Friday morning. The highest closure leverage here is ice + timing: even a glaze on untreated roads/sidewalks at bus time can force delays or selective rural route issues. Wind chills at bus time are not in the dangerous closure range (roughly 22°F ‘feels like’ around 7 AM), so cold is not the driver. If freezing drizzle persists into 5–7 AM or if the arctic-front burst produces a quick 1\"+ in an hour near/after 7 AM, the risk of a delay increases. As of this data alone, expectation is: plows can manage the snow, but a morning delay is plausible due to ice/spotty slick roads; full closure is less likely unless the glaze is more widespread than modeled."

      "Bus routing: strongly consider holding buses off rural/hilly gravel and low-priority subdivision streets until a “test loop” confirms traction/braking (around 5:30–6:15 AM). Have contingency turnarounds identified.",
      "Plan for reduced-stopping-distance operations: increase following distance, slower approach to stops, and avoid sudden braking—glaze ice risk is highest 00:00–07:00 even if snow totals look modest.",
      "Walking student mitigation: assume sidewalks are untreated. Encourage families to use traction footwear, walk on cleared shoulders where legal/safe, and add crossing guard caution due to extended vehicle stopping distances.",
      "Decision trigger guidance: if spotters/drivers report any meaningful glazing on untreated neighborhood roads at/after 5:30–6:00 AM, a delay is safer than “on-time,” because ice doesn’t plow off and salt needs time/traffic to work.",
      "If you open, consider a 2-hour delay rather than normal start: it buys daylight, more traffic polishing/salting, and reduces exposure to the worst icing window.",
      "Parking lots/bus loops: schedule early scraping/salting—compacted snow + drizzle refreeze will create slick bus loading zones even if main roads improve by mid-morning.",
      "Visibility isn’t the main problem, but there is a 06:00–08:00 low-visibility pocket (mist/light snow, vis down near ~1 mile at times) that adds risk at intersections and for student pickup recognition.",

MDOT-maintained routes (US-131/I-96 corridors feeding the area) are typically the best-treated and should be drivable by early morning, but the risk shifts to county roads and especially subdivision streets: any glaze from freezing drizzle can make untreated residential streets and some lower-priority connectors notably slick right at bus time.

I investigated via the meteorologist tool: the trusted bus-window forecast for Rockford is ~29°F with light winds (wind chill ~21–22°F), and achieving -20°F would require near-zero temps and/or much stronger winds. The Weather.com -25°F appears time/place mismatched or stale. Therefore, extreme-cold automatic-closure rules do NOT apply here.\n\nGiven Michigan’s higher closure threshold, the absence of a confirmed neighboring-district closure wave, and only scattered/stable power outages systemwide, a FULL closure is not the most likely outcome. However, the safety and infrastructure assessments both emphasize that freezing drizzle can create invisible glaze on secondary roads right when buses roll, which is exactly when districts choose delays or occasionally cancel if traction reports are bad.\n\nNet: I price this as a borderline, ice-driven decision where a 2-hour delay is more likely than a full closure; but since you asked for a single snow-day probability, I’m setting a moderate 41% chance that Rockford will NOT run a normal on-time schedule (closure most likely only if glazing is widespread at 5:30–6:30 AM or the 8 AM snow burst arrives early/heavier).",

However, the *Rockford-specific hourly snowfall* provided is relatively low and winds are not extreme, so a full closure is not the most likely outcome—more likely outcomes are “open with delays/caution” or a 2-hour delay. I therefore put full snow-day (closure) probability in the low-to-mid 30s, with delay probability likely higher (not asked for here)."

That pushes me away from high cancellation probabilities when forecast point totals are modest.\n\nWhat pulls the probability upward is the classic “sneaky closure” pattern: mixed precip/possible glaze overnight into bus time. Historically, glaze events create more operational risk per inch than snow, and they disproportionately affect secondary/rural bus-route roads, bridges, and shaded low spots—exactly the kind of localized hazard that can force a district-wide decision.\n\nNet: I land in the low-30s for **full cancellation**, while still believing **a delay is more likely than a cancel** given this forecast’s timing and mixed precip character."

That combination often produces the worst traction conditions on secondary roads, subdivision streets, bridges, and bus loops—exactly where school transportation risk concentrates. \n\nHowever, I’m not pushing probability into the 70–90% range because the modeled snow amounts are small, winds are not extreme, and visibility is not persistently poor—so if pretreatment is effective and the glaze remains patchy/trace, many districts can operate with a delay rather than cancel. Net: I see the most likely outcome as a delay, with a meaningful but not dominant chance of full closure; rolled together as “snow day” (delay or closure), I land around mid-40s."

That combination (headline + commute emphasis + ice wording) is exactly what tends to precede **2-hour delays** and occasional closures.\n\nCounterweight: in the materials retrieved, **Rockford Public Schools has not posted a closure/delay for Friday, Feb 6, 2026**, and there’s **no confirmed wave of neighboring district cancellations** yet—both of which typically appear when a high-confidence full cancel is imminent. So I’m placing this in the “meaningful disruption possible, but not a slam-dunk closure” zone.\n\nNet: I’m at **42%** for a snow day outcome (closure or significant schedule disruption), with the expectation that *if a decision happens, delay is slightly more likely than full cancellation* unless glazing reports escalate early morning."
