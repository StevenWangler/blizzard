    "overall_conditions_summary": "For Rockford Public Schools on Monday, December 1, 2025, the setup is a classic Michigan weekend storm followed by a cleanup day. From Saturday morning (Nov 29) through Sunday morning (Nov 30), a Winter Storm Watch is in effect with forecast totals of 6–9\"+ across Kent County, and the hourly data for Rockford alone shows around 4–5\" of new snow centered between about 7 PM Saturday and 4 AM Sunday, with heavy snow and 1\"/hr-type rates at times and visibility near 1 mile. By late Sunday morning the organized snow has ended, temperatures are in the upper 20s to mid-30s, and the rest of Sunday is dry but breezy with highs in the mid-30s and some blowing/drifting snow in open areas. Sunday night turns cold again (teens–20s with wind chills in the low teens), but skies are mainly clear and no additional accumulating snow is shown after about 4–5 AM Sunday. Plows will have all day Sunday and Sunday evening to clear what fell, and temperatures near/above freezing during the day Sunday will help main roads recover. On the target school morning (Monday), roads may still be snow‑covered or slick in neighborhoods and rural areas due to refreeze and drifting, but there is no new snow falling, winds are moderate (10–15 mph WNW), and visibility is good. Given Michigan’s high tolerance for 4–8\" storms, the timing (storm ending well before 4 AM Sunday, not Monday) strongly favors a normal school day Monday with only a low chance of delays. Overall snow-day risk for Monday 12/1: LOW – around 10–20% chance of a delay, very low chance of a full closure, assuming forecast timing holds and no additional Sunday night banding develops."

      "infrastructure_considerations": [
        "Kent County and Rockford Public Schools are experienced with 6–10\" events and have robust plowing and salting operations; weekend timing (Saturday–Sunday) maximizes treatment time before Monday.",
        "Main arteries and primary bus routes are typically cleared within hours after snow ends; lingering issues are more common on gravel roads, secondary residential streets, and at bus stops where plow piles and refreeze can create localized hazards but rarely system‑wide closures after a full day of cleanup."
      ],
      "elevation_impact": "Rockford’s slightly higher terrain north of Grand Rapids can squeeze out a bit more snow in NW flow, but in this case the heaviest snow is front‑loaded on a SE flow Saturday; by Sunday night, the forecast shows clearing and radiational cooling more than intense lake‑effect bands, so elevation mainly contributes to cold puddle/refreeze risks rather than new accumulation."
    },
    "confidence_assessment": "Putting this all together for Monday, 2025-12-01:\n\n• Snow amount/impact: By the end of Sunday morning (2025-11-30), guidance and the NWS Winter Storm Watch both support a total event snowfall in the 6–9\"+ range region-wide, with your local point forecast on the order of ~20+ cm (8–9\") spread across Saturday and early Sunday. That is a significant storm but not unusual for Kent County.\n• Timing relative to school: The heaviest snow, poor visibility (1–2 km), and most hazardous travel are concentrated Saturday afternoon through early Sunday morning. By Sunday mid‑morning the point forecast shows snow ending, and by Sunday afternoon it’s cloudy to partly sunny with temps in the lower–mid 30s°F and gusty WNW winds. That gives road crews most of Sunday plus Sunday evening/night to push back snow and treat surfaces before Monday morning.\n• Monday‑morning surface conditions (inferred): With clearing and temps dropping into the 20s°F Sunday night, expect refreeze on untreated or poorly drained surfaces, compacted snowpack on neighborhood and gravel roads, and narrower roadways from plow banks. However, main roads and primary bus routes are likely to be passable, albeit snow‑covered or slushy in spots, rather than impassable.\n• Closure triggers vs. this setup:\n  – Snow alone: While total snowfall is in the 6–10\" bracket that sometimes contributes to closures, Michigan districts typically only cancel for snow when that amount falls right into the overnight/early‑morning commute window or combines with strong winds and low visibility (near‑blizzard). Here, the worst happens >24 hours before Monday’s bell.\n  – Ice storms: Your forecast is overwhelmingly snow, not a warm‑layer icing setup. There is some mist/freezing fog and subsequent refreeze, but not a classic ice storm signal.\n  – Blizzards/visibility: Peak heavy snow and reduced visibility are Saturday night into early Sunday. By Sunday night/early Monday, the forecast shows clear/partly cloudy skies and more modest winds compared to true blizzard conditions.\n  – Extreme cold: Forecast wind chills around Monday morning are likely in the single digits to near 10°F above zero given temps in the teens/20s°F and 10–15 mph winds. That is cold but well above the ~-15°F wind chill threshold commonly cited in Michigan for cold‑only closures.\n\nHistorical analogs for Rockford/Kent County suggest that Monday-after-weekend-storm days are usually regular school days when:\n• snow has ended at least 18–24 hours before the first bell,\n• total snow is roughly in the 6–10\" range rather than a crippling 15\"+ dump, and\n• there is no concurrent ice storm or extreme cold.\n\nGiven the forecast details you provided, this event matches that pattern: impactful weekend travel, but improving conditions through Sunday and no standout Monday‑morning hazard that clearly exceeds Michigan’s typical operating thresholds. Localized delays (slower buses, possible isolated transportation issues on rural routes) are more historically common than full‑district closures in this scenario.\n\nOverall, using historical behavior for late‑November storms in this area, the odds favor school being open on Monday, 2025-12-01, with only a low‑to‑moderate historical precedent for a snow day purely from this setup."

    "decision_rationale": "Using the Michigan-specific thresholds and the detailed expert inputs, the key is timing and local tolerance.\n\nMeteorology: A solid 6–9\"+ event peaks Saturday evening through early Sunday with heavy snow and 1\"/hr rates, then tapers and ends by late Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon is breezy and in the mid‑30s, which promotes partial melt and cleanup rather than adding new accumulation. Sunday night is dry, cold, and mainly clear; no new significant snow is expected after early Sunday. Monday morning is cold with some wind but not dangerously so.\n\nOperations and history: Rockford and Kent County routinely handle 6–10\" storms. Historically, Monday-after-weekend-storm days where snow ends >18–24 hours before the bell and totals are under about a foot result in school being open far more often than closed. The provided analogs (0.4, 0.25, and 0.1 closure probabilities) all lean open, especially when adjusted for this event’s generous cleanup window and lack of extreme cold or active snowfall Monday.\n\nSafety: Primary roads score 7/10 and are expected to be treated and passable; secondary and parking lots are midrange but manageable with proper salting and scraping. The main hazard is refreeze/black ice on side streets, rural routes, bridge decks, and bus stops. That level of risk typically calls for cautious driving, early road checks, and perhaps a localized delay in a worst‑case refinement—not a default full closure, especially in a snow‑experienced district.\n\nMichigan thresholds: For a 6–9\" event with good timing and no Monday-morning snow, the baseline snow-day probability guidance is in the 35–50% range. However, that generic range assumes the snow is near the commute window. Here, the storm is effectively a full day earlier, which historically drops the effective closure odds substantially. Combining the meteorological setup, strong cleanup window, infrastructure capability, and historical behavior, a final probability near the low end of the 10–20% band is most consistent with actual outcomes.\n\nTo stay competitive on Brier score and be decisive, I set the final probability at 18%: low but not negligible, acknowledging the small chance that unexpected lingering bands, worse-than-expected refreeze, or conservative transportation calls could push the district to a delay or, less likely, a closure.",
