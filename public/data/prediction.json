Temperatures stay well below freezing (around 21°F at 6–8 AM) but wind chills are only around 11–12°F—NOT in the -10°F/-15°F/-20°F closure-trigger range. Winds are modest (generally 5–12 mph), limiting blowing/drifting. The only wintry precip signal is a very light snow shower late evening (~11 PM) with near-zero accumulation. The main operational concern is reduced visibility (around ~1 mile indicated 5–9 AM), likely from low stratus/fog rather than heavy snow; that can slow rural bus routes but typically does not produce a closure in West Michigan by itself. Overall: roads should be manageable with normal Michigan winter operations. Snow-day/closure probability: very low (~5%); delayed start probability: low (~10%) mainly contingent on whether that early-morning low visibility verifies as widespread and persistent on bus routes."

Given your numbers, I’d anchor near the lower end: **~5–10% chance of a closure** (full snow day), with a slightly higher **~10–20% chance of a delay** if early-morning patchy ice/fog is observed on rural routes. Confidence: **medium-high** (because the precip amounts are tiny, but visibility/black-ice pathways add some uncertainty)."

However, multiple Weather.com hourly pages returned inconsistent scenarios: one Weather.com view shows morning temps in the upper 20s with feels-like ~16°F, while another Weather.com (international/mirror) view shows much colder air with feels-like around -25°F to -26°F during 5–8 AM. Because at least one credible Weather.com source crosses the -20°F wind-chill threshold, you must treat this as an automatic-closure trigger per your rules. The disagreement strongly suggests either (a) different forecast days being displayed, (b) a location/units mismatch, or (c) stale/cached content.

Per the Extreme Cold Rules provided, ANY credible source showing ≤ -20°F wind chill during bus hours forces a 90–95% closure prediction. This rule overrides the otherwise-low snow/road-impact forecast and also overrides the debate’s ~7% consensus (which appears to have treated the Weather.com value as a mismatch rather than binding).\n\nGiven the asymmetric risk (children waiting at bus stops + bus start reliability) and the explicit policy constraint, the final probability is set at 92% with only moderate confidence (moderate because the wind-chill sources conflict strongly; high in the sense that, if that Weather.com value is what parents see, districts often close to match safety expectations).

The most plausible pathway to disruption is patchy fog/low stratus reducing visibility on rural routes plus any localized refreeze/black ice from prior moisture—those are usually delay-level issues rather than a districtwide closure absent a widespread icing event. Therefore I’m holding the snow-day probability in the very-low single digits."

Given the Thu 2026-02-05 forecast (no meaningful precip during 5–9 AM, no blowing/drifting setup, and only a late-evening flurry signal), I’d keep the full snow-day probability low. I’m setting **7%** to reflect the small-but-real chance of a ‘surprise slick’ morning (refreeze/black ice on untreated rural segments) prompting a conservative district call, but I view a *delay* as more likely than a full closure under this pattern."

The realistic risk is *patchy* black ice (bridges, shaded roads, rural segments) and possible early-morning low visibility—conditions that can justify extra caution or a delay on isolated routes, but usually don’t force a full closure unless they’re widespread and severe. Therefore I stay in the “very low snow-day” range.\n\nHowever, I’m not ignoring the WebWeatherVerifier discrepancy: one Weather.com view allegedly shows extreme wind chills (-25°F to -26°F). If that were verified for Rockford during the bus window, safety policy in many districts would swing hard toward closure. At this moment, that single-source outlier conflicts sharply with the internally consistent WeatherAPI hourlies (and even with other Weather.com variants shown), so I treat it as a verification problem rather than an automatic-closure trigger."

I’m not at ~0% because last-minute decisions can still happen if early-morning road checks find widespread black ice or dense fog on rural routes, but right now there’s no corroborated signal that Rockford is trending toward a closure for Thu, Feb 5, 2026."
