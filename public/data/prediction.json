Temps hover right around freezing (low ~32°F, daytime mid-30s) with no snow accumulation forecast (0\"), and winds are modest (max ~14 mph). The main issue is early-morning low clouds/fog around 7 AM with temps near 32–33°F—watch for isolated slick spots on untreated bridges/overpasses if any patchy mist/freezing drizzle develops, but the provided hour-by-hour data shows no precip during the bus window. Light drizzle arrives late (around 11 PM), after the school day. Bottom line: roads should be manageable for a Michigan district, and closure probability is very low; at most this is a 'drive with caution in fog' morning, not a plowable snow event."

    "verification_summary": "For Rockford, Michigan on Tuesday 2026-02-17, the key closure trigger (wind chill/feels-like ≤ -20°F) is NOT supported by the web sources captured here. Weather.com’s hourly forecast for Tue morning shows temps ~34°F with 'feels like' about 29°F around 6–8 AM, which is far above the -20°F threshold. Your WeatherAPI hourly commute-period 'feelslike' values (~26°F at 7 AM, ~25°F at 8 AM) are broadly consistent with Weather.com in direction and magnitude (both indicate a chilly but non-dangerous wind chill). The bigger issue is that WeatherAPI’s overall day temperatures (high ~35°F) look materially colder than Weather.com’s daytime warming into the 40s; for snow-day decisioning, that discrepancy matters mainly for precipitation type (risk of freezing drizzle/ice) rather than extreme cold closures. Snowfall appears negligible in both your WeatherAPI forecast (0 snow) and Weather.com’s hourly precipitation depiction (rain later, not snow).",

The only meaningful disagreement was safety’s ‘moderate’ ice risk despite little/no forecast precip at commute time; after clarification, that risk is specifically a *patchy* mechanism (fog deposition/flash-freeze on bridge decks/untreated low-traffic spots), not widespread glazing. In Michigan, patchy hazards plus fog more commonly lead to caution messaging (or at most a delay if early bus checks find multiple icy segments), not a district-wide closure—especially with no confirmed neighboring-district closures and a TV closings page showing no active delays/closures. Power-grid risk appears low given the benign weather profile; live outage confirmation is limited, but there’s no evidence of a regional outage event that would force closure.
