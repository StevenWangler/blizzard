The main operational risk is freezing fog/mist overnight into early morning while temps sit ~9–10°F at bus time, which can create localized slick spots (especially untreated bridges/secondary roads) and reduced visibility. Winds are light (generally 2–7 mph), so no blowing/drifting snow and no significant wind-chill-driven closure signal. Bus-time wind chills look around single digits to near 0°F (not near the Michigan closure thresholds of -15°F to -20°F). Bottom line: schools very likely OPEN, with a small risk of delays only if dense freezing fog is widespread at 6–8 AM.\n\nMichigan decision calibration:\n- Snow/ice amount: 0\" snow; no precip indicated on 2/4 → closure probability low.\n- Timing: no active precip at 6–7 AM → plows not a limiting factor.\n- Visibility: watch for freezing fog pockets near daybreak; if visibility drops to <1/4 mile broadly, that’s the only credible driver for a delay.\n\nPractical call for Rockford for Wed 2/4:\n- Snow-day (full closure) probability: ~3–8%.\n- Delay probability: ~10–20% (entirely dependent on how dense/widespread the freezing fog becomes right around 6–8 AM)."

If freezing fog is truly dense and widespread (visibility ~0–1 mile for several hours) *and* roads are already damp from Tue’s light freezing rain/snow, you can see delays or a rare closure. Calibrated Michigan call: **~8–15% chance of a full snow day/closure**, **~20–35% chance of a 2-hour delay** (delay more likely than closure).

      "Operationally, consider a *2-hour delay trigger* if early-morning visibility is poor (fog) OR if spotters report icy patches on secondary roads before buses roll (~6:15–6:45 AM). This is a ‘Michigan-typical’ delay scenario more than a full closure scenario.",
      "Have transportation supervisors run an early test loop focusing on: subdivision entrances, stop-controlled intersections, and bridge decks. If tires slip on light braking at 10–15 mph, conditions are not acceptable for full routing.",
      "Communicate to families: slower bus speeds likely; remind about reflective gear because low visibility is plausible around dawn.",

However, web cross-checking produced conflicting public-facing values. Weather.com’s Rockford hourly page (US units) shows early-morning temperatures near -1 to -2°F with feels-like around -13 to -16°F (not crossing the -20°F line). Separately, a Weather.com locale-variant hourly page (metric display) for Rockford shows much colder readings around -18°C with feels-like -25°C to -26°C (≈ -13°F air temp, ≈ -13°F?; feels-like ≈ -13°F? Note: the page explicitly states 'Feels Like -25°' and '-26°', which in that context appears to be °C, equating to -13°F to -15°F). Because that variant still explicitly shows a 'Feels Like' at or below -25 (and could be interpreted as °F by end users), it triggers an operational risk: parents checking apps may see 'feels like' values that look ≤ -20. A local republished NWS-style 7-day forecast mentions Wednesday wind chills as low as about -8°F (no extreme cold). Net: snowfall is not the driver; the decision hinges on wind chill perception and the large feels-like discrepancy between sources.",

    "decision_rationale": "Base case (most likely): Rockford is OPEN. All core experts (meteorology/history/safety/news/infrastructure/power) agree this is not a plowable snow event: forecast snowfall is 0\" with light winds and no storm warnings. The only credible operational hazard is freezing fog/mist in the pre-dawn window, which can create patchy glaze (bridges/ramps/subdivision streets/parking lots) and localized visibility drops near bus time.\n\nWhere the analyses conflict: the Web Weather Verification flagged a critical ≤-20°F wind chill based on a Weather.com locale-variant crawl with stale timestamps and likely unit ambiguity (°C vs °F). That conflicts with (1) the meteorologist’s bus-hour wind chill estimate (~8–10°F), (2) the same verifier’s Weather.com US-unit page showing only about -13 to -16°F ‘feels like’, and (3) the NWS-style text forecast indicating wind chills nearer -8°F. Given the internal inconsistency and staleness in the extreme value, I am not treating ≤-20°F as the operative hazard for this specific decision. Instead, I treat the credible, consistent signal as: cold but not dangerously extreme wind chill, with fog/black-ice as the main risk.\n\nPlow timing math: with no new snow expected, roads should not be degrading from snowfall during the commute. Infrastructure expects primary corridors clear already; local streets/parking lots should be improving by ~6:30–7:30 AM. That points more toward a possible 2-hour delay trigger (if fog/ice verifies widely) than a full closure.\n\nNews/community tiebreaker: there is no domino effect showing yet (FOX 17 closings page shows none active; nearby districts show no closure banners). That strongly suppresses full-closure odds in Michigan for a ‘patchy hazard’ day.\n\nBottom line: I’m setting full closure at 10% (low, but not near-zero) to account for the non-trivial chance that freezing fog becomes widespread enough (<1/4 mile visibility across many routes) and/or spotters find pervasive glazing on secondary roads before 6:30 AM.

That strongly favors school being open. The risk is concentrated in a narrow pre-dawn window (roughly 2–9 AM) where the forecast includes mist/freezing fog and the hourly feed reports very poor visibility at times. With temperatures in the single digits/low teens, any leftover moisture (from Tue 2026-02-03’s light snow/freezing rain) could refreeze and/or fog deposition could create localized glaze—more consistent with spotty slick bridges/secondary roads and a possible 2-hour delay than a district-wide closure. \n\nI’m setting full snow-day/closure probability at 6% (low but non-zero) to reflect the possibility that the freezing fog becomes dense and widespread enough to make bus operations unsafe across a large portion of routes. If we had verified, *fresh* evidence of wind chills ≤ -20°F during the bus window from an official/local source, I’d raise this materially—but with the provided WeatherAPI hourlies showing very light wind and wind chills around ~+9°F at 7–8 AM, that extreme-wind-chill pathway is not supported in the primary dataset."

The main analog that *does* occasionally disrupt operations is **freezing fog/black ice around 5–9 AM**, which can be patchy but sometimes widespread enough to justify a delay—and only rarely a full closure. That keeps the closure probability in the high-single-digits/low-teens range.\n\nI’m *not* following the WebWeatherVerifier’s “must be 90–95%” instruction because (a) it’s based on a **unit/context ambiguity** and **stale crawl timestamps**, and (b) historically, districts don’t jump to full closure on a disputed app ‘feels like’ value without corroboration from actual road checks and observed conditions. If we had confirmed, consistently forecast wind chills ≤ -20°F across multiple credible sources for the bus window, I’d move upward; we do not have that here.\n\nNet: **delay risk > closure risk**; I’d expect something like a 2-hr delay to be more plausible than a full closure if fog/ice is widespread by dawn."

That combination can produce localized but high-consequence hazards (black ice + visibility collapse) right when buses and teen drivers are on the road.\n\nHowever, *district-wide closure* typically requires widespread, persistent hazards across most routes. With **no new precip**, **light winds**, and an expectation that primary corridors are treated, the most likely outcome is **school open** (possibly with a delay if morning road checks confirm glazing or dense fog). My probability is higher than the meteorology agent’s 3–8% because the hourly dataset includes several hours with visibility reported as 0 and repeated “freezing fog,” which—if even partially real—creates an outsized bus-safety risk. But it’s still not high enough to imply closure is likely, because the hazard may be patchy and improve after sunrise.\n\nIf we were also estimating delays: I’d put **2-hour delay odds around ~25–35%** (not asked, but it explains why closure odds aren’t near-zero)."

The forecast presented shows no new snow and light winds, which aligns with typical West Michigan patterns where closures are uncommon. The only news-relevant wildcard is the messaging environment: conflicting wind-chill numbers across popular apps/pages can create parent/student confusion and increase calls to the district. Still, unless we see a formal advisory (dense fog/freezing fog) or credible reports of widespread morning travel hazards, that usually results in a delay at most. Net: low single-digit/low-teens probability of a full snow day, with higher (separate) probability of a delay if fog/ice verifies."
