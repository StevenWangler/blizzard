Temperatures remain below freezing all day (mid 20s °F early bus time, upper 20s by afternoon), but there is essentially no precipitation signal: hourly guidance shows 0.00\" precip and 0.0 cm snow, with 0% modeled chance of snow or rain overnight through the school day. Winds are light to moderate (generally 5–10 mph, gusts under ~15 mph) producing only minor extra wind chill, nothing unusual for West Michigan. Visibility is occasionally reduced to around 1–2 miles under overcast/low clouds and some patchy mist, but without active snow or ice this is more of a gray, gloomy day than a hazardous one. Importantly for Michigan snow-day standards: (1) no accumulating snow, (2) no freezing rain or glaze, (3) no strong wind/whiteout risk, and (4) plows are not needed because roads should remain dry to just seasonally cold. Overall, the probability of a weather-related closure or delay for Friday, 2025-12-12 is extremely low—functionally near 0% based on this forecast."

In comparable mid‑December setups for West‑Central Michigan, school is almost always in session. The only marginal concern—some light freezing rain and mixed precip on Thursday—appears limited in both duration and amount, with no indication of a significant overnight refreeze or storm continuation. Overall, this aligns with many past routine school days in the Rockford/Grand Rapids area, so the historically informed probability of a snow day under these conditions is very close to zero, with high confidence."

NWS Grand Rapids and statewide outlets describe winter weather advisories and several‑inch snow potential in parts of Lower Michigan, with a tricky north–south gradient in where heavier snow vs. mixed precipitation sets up. That translates into a **credible risk of slick, snow‑covered roads for the Friday morning commute**, particularly on rural and less‑treated routes around Rockford, but current TV and NWS guidance leans toward **light–moderate, nuisance‑type impacts rather than a clearly catastrophic storm**.\n\nRegionally, Kent ISD and other Michigan districts have already closed earlier this week for this storm system, showing that superintendents are paying close attention to conditions. However, as of the latest scans, there is **no domino wave of confirmed Friday closures** in the Grand Rapids/Rockford cluster and social chatter is in a **wait‑and‑see/uncertain** mode – people are talking about the chance of a snow day but largely expect that the final call will come early Friday morning once actual overnight snowfall and road conditions are known.\n\nIn short: conditions and the broader advisory pattern definitely put **Rockford Public Schools on ‘snow‑day watch’ for Friday**, but public information right now does **not** show an announced closure, nor a strong, unified expectation online that Friday is already ‘a sure thing’ for a snow day.

    "decision_rationale": "1. PRE‑DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) What do all four experts AGREE on?\n- Meteorologist: Rockford (49341) is cold but quiet Friday—0.00\" precip, 0%–5% chance of any flurry, no accumulating snow, no ice signal, light winds, no advisories locally.\n- Historian: This pattern (cold, dry, no alerts, no accumulation) historically yields an extremely low snow‑day rate (~1–3%) in West‑Central Michigan.\n- Safety analyst: Roads for Friday morning are in good winter shape—primary 9/10, secondary 8/10, low–moderate black‑ice risk, minimal commute impact; normal start is recommended.\n- News intel: No Rockford‑area district has announced a Friday closure or delay; regional messaging frames Friday as a nuisance‑level slick commute at worst, not a crippling storm.\n\nAll agree: cold, typical winter day; no active storm over Rockford during the school window; conditions are compatible with normal operations.\n\n2) Where do they DISAGREE?\n- The only tension is between broad regional headlines (winter weather advisories, several inches of snow in parts of Lower Michigan) and the Rockford‑specific point forecast showing essentially no precip.\n- I resolved this with the meteorologist tool: latest guidance confirms Rockford is *outside* the main advisory snow corridor. The local hourly forecast is dry and self‑consistent; any flurry or freezing drizzle risk is ~5–10% probability and trace at most.\n- News intel further confirms: there is no domino wave of Friday closures in the immediate Grand Rapids/Rockford cluster.\n\nSo, after cross‑checks, there is *no substantive conflict* for Rockford itself—regional advisories apply mainly elsewhere.\n\n3) Plow timing math (hours from snow end to ~7:40 AM)\n- Safety analyst places the last meaningful mixed precip/freezing drizzle Thursday around 4–7 PM.\n- Forecast then has **no measurable precip from ~8 PM Thu through at least noon Fri**.\n- That gives:\n  - ~10–12+ dry hours before the 6–8 AM bus window.\n  - ~12–14 dry hours before a ~7:40 AM start.\n- In Kent County’s context, this is ample time for:\n  - County crews to plow/salt mains multiple times if needed.\n  - Targeted attention to rural routes and bus hills.\n  - School grounds crews to clear/salt lots and sidewalks.\n\nPlow timing clearly supports *normal* operations.\n\n4) Is there ANY ice? (ice changes everything)\n- Meteorologist: freezing drizzle/ice risk 5–10%; expected additional accumulation ~0.00\" (trace at worst). No freezing rain signal, no ice storm, no glaze layer modeled.\n- Safety analyst: characterizes ice risk as **moderate**, but in context: patchy refreeze on bridges, shaded curves, and spots in parking lots—manageable with salt/sand and routine caution; not systemic glare ice.\n\nSo ice is a background, localized hazard—not a systemwide, closure‑level event.\n\n5) What are neighboring districts doing?\n- News intel (plus original local intel):\n  - Rockford PS: no closure/delay announced for Friday as of Thursday evening.\n  - Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent City, GRPS, Kenowa Hills, Comstock Park: **no Friday closures or delays posted** on district pages or major closings lists.\n  - FOX 17 closings: show earlier‑week closures (e.g., Wed Dec 10) but **no Friday Dec 12 entries** for the Rockford cluster.\n- This means **0 neighboring districts** are known to be closed for Friday. Per your rules, the +15–20% adjustment for 3+ neighboring closures clearly does *not* apply.\n\n6) What would make me WRONG?\nKey failure modes:\n- An unmodeled surprise band: a narrow lake‑effect or synoptic band sets up over Rockford overnight, dropping 3–5\" between midnight and 7 AM. This conflicts with current 0.00\" guidance and expert meteorological assessment, so probability is very low but not zero.\n- Unexpected freezing drizzle event: low stratus and high humidity produce a few hours of light freezing drizzle, creating widespread glare ice despite low QPF. Current forecast puts this at only 5–10% probability with trace accumulation; still, if this happened, morning road conditions could be much worse than now modeled.\n- Over‑cautious human decision: Superintendents sometimes overreact to regional headlines or earlier‑week closures. But notable: there is *no* strong social/media drumbeat locally that Friday is a “sure snow day,” and all local, Rockford‑specific weather inputs say “quiet.” The odds of a closure *without* matching conditions are small, but nonzero.\n\nGiven these, the main path to being wrong is a **surprise localized hazard** not present in the current data. I still judge that risk as very low.\n\n2. WEIGHTED EXPERT SYNTHESIS\nUsing your specified weights:\n- Meteorology (35%):\n  - Rockford‑specific forecast: 0\" new snow, 0%–5% precip, no warnings, typical mid‑20s cold, light wind.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~1–2%.\n- Safety (25%):\n  - Low risk; normal winter operations; minimal commute impact.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~2–3% (allowing for modest caution about patchy ice).\n- History (20%):\n  - Analog snow‑day rates: 1–3% in similar setups.\n  - Implied closure probability: ~2%.\n- News intelligence (20%):\n  - Secret weapon check: \n    - No neighboring Friday closures → **no +15–20% bump**.\n    - Community sentiment: “uncertain / wait‑and‑see,” not “this is a guaranteed snow day.” That nudges probabilities slightly *down* from what regional advisories alone might suggest.\n  - Implied closure probability from behavior signals: ~3–5% (I’ll take ~4% as an upper bound because people are at least talking about the possibility).\n\nCombining (roughly weighted average):\n- 0.35×2% (met) ≈ 0.7%\n- 0.25×3% (safety) ≈ 0.75%\n- 0.20×2% (history) ≈ 0.4%\n- 0.20×4% (news/community) ≈ 0.8%\n≈ 2.65%, which I round to **3%** to appropriately reflect low‑probability tail risks without under‑stating them.\n\n3. MICHIGAN THRESHOLD FRAMEWORK\nYour Michigan thresholds:\n- <4\" snow → 5–15% baseline.\n- Here, forecast is **~0\" new snow** and no ice storm. That’s actually *better* than your lowest threshold (which assumes *some* accumulation). Michigan routinely operates in cold/dry with patchy slick spots—exactly this setup.\n- Because neighboring districts are **not** closed, we *don’t* apply the +15–20% bump.\n- No blizzard, no ice storm, no major wind chill event.\n\nThus, a figure *below* your 5–15% lowest band is justified. I set **3%** to leave a small margin for surprise while still clearly conveying \"extremely unlikely.\"\n\n4. WHY NOT IN THE 40–60% ‘MUSHY MIDDLE’\n- All four experts independently converge on **“very low chance of closure”**.\n- There is no significant conflict between tools after reconciliation.\n- Storm impacts are focused elsewhere in Michigan; Rockford’s point forecast is quiet.\n- Neighboring‑district behavior and sentiment provide no sign of a closure domino.\n\nSo a 40–60% range would badly misrepresent the evidence and produce a poor Brier score. A decisive, low probability is warranted.\n\nFinal call: **Rockford Public Schools are overwhelmingly likely to be OPEN and ON TIME on Friday, December 12, 2025.**",
