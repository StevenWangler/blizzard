    ],
    "overall_conditions_summary": "From a school-operations standpoint for Rockford Public Schools on Monday, December 1, 2025, the setup is a classic Michigan heavy-snow-weekend event that largely winds down before the school day.\n\n• Timing: The heaviest snow occurs from Saturday afternoon through early Sunday morning. On the target day’s eve (Sunday 11/30), accumulating snow is confined to the midnight–4 AM window (heavy to moderate), tapering to mist/freezing fog by about 5 AM and ending well before typical Monday bus times. This gives plow crews many hours (roughly 6–10 hours) to treat primary and secondary roads.\n\n• Amounts: Forecast totals Saturday–early Sunday for Kent County are in the 6–9\"+ range, with the 11/30 day itself adding roughly 10–11 cm (~4.3\") of snow, most of it falling just after midnight. For West Michigan, a 6–10\" weekend storm is notable but not unusual; districts here commonly remain open with this magnitude when it finishes overnight and main roads get cleared.\n\n• Temperatures: Air temps stay below freezing during and after the storm overnight (mid 20s F), then climb only into the mid 30s F (around 36°F) Sunday afternoon before dropping back into the 20s Sunday night. Surfaces will refreeze, so there will be slick spots, but no prolonged warmup/rain-then-freeze scenario that typically produces crippling glaze ice. This is primarily a snow and patchy freezing-fog event, not a significant ice storm.\n\n• Precipitation type: Hourly data shows heavy to moderate snow between roughly 00:00–04:00 Sunday, changing to mist/freezing fog by 05:00 and then dry with some freezing fog into mid-morning. No rain or mixed precipitation is indicated during the latter half of Sunday, which reduces the risk of widespread glazing on top of the snowpack.\n\n• Wind/Drifting: Winds peak around 15–16 mph (gusts into the low 20s mph), mainly out of the NW/SE depending on phase of the storm. That’s enough for some drifting and reduced visibility at times in open country and rural bus routes, but this is well short of a full-blown ground blizzard in West Michigan terms.\n\n• Visibility: During peak snow (late Saturday night into early Sunday) visibility can drop to ~1 mile, occasionally less, but improves through Sunday as the snow ends. By Sunday evening and into the overnight before Monday, conditions are mainly clear to partly cloudy with good visibility.\n\nSNOW DAY IMPLICATION FOR MONDAY 12/01:\nGiven Michigan’s high tolerance for snow, the fact that the heavy snow ends many hours before the school commute, and the absence of a major ice component or extreme winds, the meteorological risk for a full snow day in Rockford on Monday is relatively low. Some rural/secondary roads may remain snow-covered or slippery, and isolated delays or transportation challenges are possible, but plow timing strongly favors schools being able to open on schedule.\n\nIn summary, this is a significant weekend winter storm with impactful travel Saturday night into early Sunday, but conditions on the actual Monday school day are expected to be cold and wintry yet manageable once plowing and salting are completed."

    "confidence_assessment": "Based on the provided forecast, this looks like a significant but fairly typical early‑season storm for Rockford: weekend heavy snow with a Winter Storm Watch calling for roughly 6–9+ inches, with the bulk of accumulation from Saturday morning through Sunday morning (Nov 29–30). Hourly data for Sunday (Nov 30) show heavy snow ending by around 4 AM, no additional snow during the daylight hours, and even some clearing and highs above freezing by afternoon. Winds are in the 10–16 mph range with gusts near 20–30 mph, enough for some drifting but not true blizzard conditions. By Sunday evening, conditions are clear/cold with temps in the 20s. \n\nIn historical Michigan practice, districts in Kent County and similar West Michigan areas typically remain open on the Monday after a weekend storm like this unless: (a) snow continues or new lake‑effect bands are actively impacting the Monday morning commute, (b) totals exceed expectations with widespread unplowed rural roads, or (c) there is a coincident ice or extreme cold event. None of those are indicated in the forecast you provided for late Sunday into Sunday night. \n\nGiven that: (1) the heaviest snow appears confined to Saturday–early Sunday, (2) Sunday daytime is mainly dry with some sun and temps climbing to the mid 30s°F, allowing for effective cleanup, and (3) winds and wind chills on Sunday night into early Monday remain above typical extreme‑cold closure criteria, the closest historical analogs suggest that Rockford Public Schools would more often open on Monday, December 1, potentially with only localized issues on back roads rather than a system‑wide snow day. \n\nOverall confidence in this pattern‑based assessment is medium. Forecasts 3 days out can still shift (e.g., slower storm exit or stronger lake‑effect behind the system), and local superintendent decisions sometimes respond conservatively if actual totals exceed the 8–10\" range or if Sunday night refreeze creates significant black ice. But using historical norms for late‑November West Michigan storms of this type, the weather signal alone would not strongly favor a full Monday snow day at Rockford; it aligns more with scenarios where schools are open after a challenging but manageable weekend storm."

    "decision_rationale": "Using the Michigan-specific thresholds and the provided expert analyses:\n\n1. **Snow amounts vs Michigan norms**\n- Forecast weekend totals: **6–9\"+**, with about **4.3\"** centered around midnight–4 AM Sunday.\n- For Michigan, 4–6\" typically corresponds to only **15–35%** closure odds, and even 6–8\" only reaches **35–50%** when timing is bad (i.e., active during the commute). Here, the worst timing is **Saturday PM–early Sunday**, not Monday.\n\n2. **Timing relative to school operations**\n- Heavy snow ends by roughly **4–5 AM Sunday**, with only mist/freezing fog after that.\n- Sunday daylight is mainly dry with some sun and temps into the **mid‑30s°F**, which supports **effective cleanup**.\n- Road crews then have **all day Sunday and Sunday night** to clear and widen roads, treat major intersections, and handle parking lots.\n- By the **Monday 5–8 AM window**, no ongoing snow, no fog, and no major wind/visibility issues are indicated.\n\n3. **Road and safety assessment**\n- Safety tool scores (1 = worst, 5 = best): primary roads **5**, secondary **4**, parking lots **4**, walking **4**, driving **4**. That’s consistent with **manageable but slick** conditions, not widespread impassable roads.\n- **Ice risk is high** due to overnight refreeze, but that is a routine winter hazard in West Michigan and normally addressed with salting and caution, not system‑wide closure.\n\n4. **Historical pattern context**\n- Pattern analogs show snow day rates of **~40%, 25%, and 15%** for similar storms, but Rockford tends to close only when:\n  - The storm is ongoing into the **Monday commute**; or\n  - Totals exceed **8–10\"** with active drifting; or\n  - There’s **ice/extreme cold**. \n- Here, snow is mainly **weekend**, drifting is modest (gusts low 20s mph, not a blizzard), and there is **no major ice-storm or extreme-cold component**.\n- Seasonal adjustment explicitly suggests **less likelihood of closure** (-0.1 in the historical assessment).\n\n5. **Why not lower or higher than 22%?**\n- Not near 5–10% because:\n  - Totals are relatively high (6–9\"+),\n  - There is **high ice risk** on untreated surfaces and rural/hilly routes often stay worse longer,\n  - The Winter Storm Watch language (“difficult to potentially impossible travel during the height of the storm”) sometimes nudges superintendents to be cautious if cleanup underperforms.\n- Not as high as 30–35% because:\n  - No active Monday-morning snow, fog, or high winds;\n  - Primary and most secondary roads are expected to be in **good** shape by Monday morning;\n  - Historical practice in Kent County is to **run school** after a weekend event like this unless something goes notably wrong.\n\nSynthesizing meteorology, history, and safety, the most defensible, Brier-score-conscious estimate is that Rockford Public Schools are **much more likely to be open than closed** on Monday, December 1, 2025. I set the final snow day probability at **22%**: low but not negligible, reflecting some residual risk from refreeze and rural roads rather than active storm conditions.",
