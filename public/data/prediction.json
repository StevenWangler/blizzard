The main ‘watch item’ is the forecasted overnight/early-morning low visibility (possible ice fog) plus black-ice risk on untreated roads and bridges; if visibility drops broadly below ~1/4–1/2 mile around 6–8 AM and roads glaze, a delay is more plausible than a full closure.

However, web verification is mixed: NWS (weather.gov point forecast for Rockford) supports a cold Monday with a high near 15°F but does not clearly expose an hourly wind-chill series for 2026-01-26 in the captured text, so it does not confirm sub -20°F wind chills for Monday. The Weather.com hourly page content we retrieved shows 'Feels Like' values around -22°F to -24°F, which WOULD trigger the below -20°F threshold, but the page’s day labels in the captured content appear to correspond to a different date window than Monday 2026-01-26, making it unreliable for this specific school-day decision.

    "decision_rationale": "Pre-decision checklist synthesis:\n1) Agreement: All experts align that Monday is cold but dry with 0\" new snow and no freezing rain signal; closure risk is mainly from localized black ice and possible patchy ice fog, not snowfall.\n2) Disagreement: The only meaningful conflict was web wind-chill data (some weather.com snapshots suggesting much colder). Web verification follow-up supports using WeatherAPI + NWS: NWS point forecast for Monday states wind chills as low as ~-7°F, and no reliable source confirms ≤ -20°F for the Mon 1/26 bus window.\n3) Plow timing math: With no snow event to end (0\" forecast), there’s no “snow-end-to-7:40 AM” recovery window needed. Infrastructure expects state highways clear and county/local roads passable by ~6:30 AM, though not necessarily bare pavement on neighborhood streets.\n4) Ice: No freezing rain indicated. Ice risk is residual/refreeze/packed-snow persistence in extreme cold (moderate but localized), plus possible ice-fog deposition.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel follow-up found no Mon 1/26 closure/delay posts for Rockford or nearby districts in accessible sources; earlier-week closures exist but are not Mon-specific, so no +15–20% neighbor adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Consumers Energy shows low systemwide outages (tens of customers affected) with no confirmed Rockford facility impact; this is not a strong closure driver right now.\n7) Wind chill cross-check: NWS + WeatherAPI both stay well above the -20°F threshold; therefore no cold-based near-automatic closure.\n8) What would make this wrong: (a) Dense ice fog persists into 6–8 AM broadly (not just valleys) causing widespread low visibility on bus routes, (b) an unforecast freezing drizzle/light snow creates a thin glaze overnight, or (c) a localized power outage hits one or more key school buildings early Monday.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology 25% + Safety 20% + History 15% + News 15% + Infrastructure 10% + Power 10% + Web verifier 5%. Most components point strongly to “open” with a small tail risk for a DELAY; that keeps full snow-day probability low.

I’m not at 0% because (a) extreme cold can preserve packed/slippery side streets from prior events, and (b) the forecast contains an unusually strong low-visibility signal that—if it occurs during the commute rather than 2–4 AM—has historically produced occasional delays/rare closures.

The plausible safety-based disruption is a DELAY driven by (a) patchy refreeze/black ice on secondary roads and lots/sidewalks, and/or (b) dense fog/ice fog reducing bus-route visibility around the 6–8 AM window. Because the precip is nil, I keep the full snow-day probability low, but not near-zero due to the unusually low visibility signal and the persistence of slick spots in extreme cold."

But the target day (Mon 1/26) forecast is cold *and dry*, with no new snow/ice signal—so the main closure pathway is absent. The only plausible Monday trigger is a localized visibility/black-ice problem around the bus window; that supports a small delay/closure probability, but not a high one without an active storm or confirmed widespread road issues.\n\nNet: low single-digit chance of a full snow day; slightly higher chance of a 2-hour delay (not separately requested), hence a modest 7% overall “no school” probability."
