    "overall_conditions_summary": "From late Sunday night through all of Monday (Dec 29) Rockford/Kent County is under a Winter Storm Watch and in the core impact zone. Forecast shows a sharp changeover from heavy rain to sleet and then snow between roughly 2–5 AM, with temperatures dropping from upper‑30s into the upper‑20s and remaining below freezing all day. This sets up a flash‑freeze scenario on already wet roads.\n\nBetween about 3 AM and noon, precipitation is largely sleet and then snow with sustained winds around 25–30 mph and gusts frequently 40–50+ mph (locally up to 60 mph per NWS). Model guidance here somewhat undercounts totals (only ~1.1 cm explicitly coded), but the NWS watch specifically calls for 4–7\" possible; blowing and drifting will magnify the travel impact even if totals end up on the lower end. Visibilities in the hourly forecast drop to near zero (0 mi repeatedly flagged) from roughly 3 AM through early afternoon due to heavy/blowing snow.\n\nKey school‑impact factors for Monday:\n- **Timing:** Deterioration begins well before bus hours, with temps below freezing and intense wind‑driven snow and very poor visibility right through the morning drive. Conditions remain hazardous into the afternoon/evening, so there is no clear improvement window for a late start.\n- **Road treatment:** Wet pavement from Sunday’s 1\"+ of rain will freeze as temps fall through the night. Plows will be fighting both accumulating snow and strong winds causing rapid drifting and reduced visibility. Even for a West Michigan district accustomed to snow, the combination of flash freeze + high winds + whiteouts is high‑impact.\n- **Wind/visibility:** Frequent 35–45+ mph gusts with blowing snow and repeated near‑zero visibility hours are the kind of setup where many Michigan districts, including snow‑savvy ones, cancel rather than risk bus operations and secondary roads.\n\nConsidering Michigan’s higher snow tolerance (4–6\" routine) but low tolerance for ice/whiteout and the explicit NWS wording about \"treacherous and potentially life‑threatening\" travel and impacts to both the Monday morning and evening commutes, the risk for a snow day (full cancellation) in Rockford Public Schools on Monday, Dec 29 is **very high**. Expectation: **strong likelihood of no school**, with a smaller but non‑zero chance of district-by-district variation depending on any last‑minute forecast shifts or how quickly the heaviest banding sets up overnight."

Key closure signals are present: (1) NWS Winter Storm Watch for Kent County for late Sunday night through Monday evening, citing 4–7\" snow possible, gusts up to ~60 mph, and whiteout/treacherous travel potential; (2) model guidance showing rain changing to sleet/snow by the pre-dawn hours of Monday with visibility repeatedly near 0 km and sustained winds 25–30+ mph, gusting into the 40s during the morning commute; (3) continued blowing snow, hazardous visibility, and strong winds through the afternoon and early evening. Temperatures and wind chills (single digits to low teens) are not, by themselves, in the extreme-cold closure range for Michigan, but the combination of rapidly deteriorating road conditions, potential flash-freeze from heavy rain to subfreezing temps, and significant blowing/drifting is exactly the kind of setup that has historically produced snow days in Rockford and nearby districts in late December and January. Historically, similar watch-level winter storms with whiteout risk and commute-focused wording have led to Rockford-area closures or at least widespread delays more often than not. Overall, the pattern suggests a relatively high historical likelihood of some level of school disruption (closure or delay) for Monday, December 29, 2025, driven by travel safety, not just snow totals, though exact decisions will hinge on overnight storm evolution and whether the heaviest banding and strongest winds verify during the 4–9 AM window."

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1. Expert agreement:\n- Meteorology, history, and safety all agree this is a high-impact winter storm for Rockford: 4–7\" snow potential, flash-freeze from prior rain, 25–35 mph winds with gusts near 60 mph, and repeated near-zero visibility, especially 3–9 AM and through much of the day.\n- All three classify travel risk during normal school hours as severe, with no good window for a simple delay; conditions are bad before, during, and after the usual school day.\n- The news intelligence agrees conditions are wintry but adds the critical fact that Rockford Public Schools is already closed for Winter Break on Dec 29, so there is no standard attendance day to cancel.\n\n2. Expert disagreement:\n- There is no substantive conflict about the storm’s severity or timing; all point toward hazardous conditions.\n- The only practical divergence is about decision stakes: meteorology/history/safety talk as if a closure decision is needed, while news intelligence shows that the calendar already has school closed. This is not a disagreement about weather, just about operational context.\n\n3. Plow timing math:\n- Worst conditions: ~3:00 AM–6:00 PM on Monday.\n- Typical high school bus/driver window is roughly 6:00–8:00 AM, with roads ideally needing cleanup completed by ~7:00–7:30 AM.\n- Because heavy/blowing snow and whiteouts begin by ~3:00 AM and persist well past noon, plows have effectively 0 hours of calm between snow ending and the 7:40 AM start; they are working through the storm, not after it. Strong winds and drifting undo progress quickly, especially on rural routes.\n- This supports the safety analyst’s assessment that even continuous plowing won’t reliably make all routes safe for a normal start.\n\n4. Ice risk:\n- Forecast shows significant rain Sunday, then temps rapidly falling from the upper 30s into the 20s overnight, producing a flash-freeze on wet roads prior to and during the changeover to sleet and then snow (2–5 AM).\n- There is also a regional advisory for freezing rain/light ice in nearby counties, implying at least some risk of an icy base layer under the snow.\n- In Michigan criteria, the combination of ice/flash-freeze plus blowing snow and whiteouts is treated more seriously than snow totals alone and typically pushes closure probabilities into the higher range for days when school is scheduled.\n\n5. Neighboring districts:\n- News intelligence reports no active wave of weather-related closures because most neighboring districts are also on winter break around Dec 29.\n- That means there is no incremental probability bump from “3+ neighboring districts closed for weather,” but it also means Rockford is not an outlier; the entire region simply isn’t holding classes that day.\n\n6. What would make this prediction wrong?\n- The main way to be “wrong” in a Brier-score sense would be misclassifying whether Dec 29 counts as a snow day versus a scheduled break.\n- The calendar and district news clearly mark Dec 29 as NO SCHOOL – Winter Break, so the correct interpretation is: there is no formal snow-day decision, but if school had been scheduled, conditions strongly support a closure.\n\nWEIGHTING THE FOUR EXPERTS (per instructions)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strong storm, 4–7\" snow, 25–35 mph winds with gusts near 60 mph, whiteouts, subfreezing temps all day, and poor visibility, directly supports a very high chance that normal school operations would be unsafe.\n- Safety (25% weight): Rates risk as severe for roads and travel, with explicit recommendations that conditions meet or exceed usual Michigan snow day criteria and that even a delay would be insufficient.\n- History (20% weight): Similar past events in Rockford show 50–70% snow-day rates, and this case looks more like the higher-end blizzard/whiteout pattern than a routine 4–5\" event.\n- News intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon): Confirms Dec 29 is already a scheduled no-school day and that neighboring districts are also not in regular session.\n\nDECISION INTERPRETATION AND PROBABILITY\n- If Dec 29 were a NORMAL school day, the combined evidence (storm severity, timing, flash-freeze, whiteouts, safety and historical data) would put the weather-based closure probability solidly in the 80–90% range, aligned with the “8+ inches OR ice = 60–85%” and “blizzard/ice storm = 80–95%” Michigan thresholds.\n- However, because the district calendar already designates Dec 29 as NO SCHOOL – Winter Break, the practical question, “Will students have school?” has an even higher probability of ‘no’ regardless of weather.\n- To reflect the real-world outcome while also acknowledging that the closure is scheduled rather than purely weather-driven, I assign a 95% probability that there is no school on Dec 29 and that any additional ‘snow day’ designation is moot.\n\nThus, outcome framing:\n- Operationally: Students do not attend school on Monday, Dec 29 (winter break), and conditions are such that, had school been scheduled, a snow day would very likely have been called.\n- Brier-score framing: High probability assigned to ‘no school’ outcome, supported both by the calendar and by severe weather-safety concerns.",
