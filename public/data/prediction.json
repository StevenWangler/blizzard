With Michigan’s high snow tolerance and several hours for plows after snow ends (~after 4–5 AM), a full snow day is unlikely based on snow amounts alone. The bigger concern is localized low visibility and drifting later Thursday evening/night (patchy moderate snow/blowing snow), which would impact after-school/evening travel more than the Thursday morning commute. Overall: low-to-moderate disruption risk for opening on time; higher risk for slick spots and reduced visibility in spots, but not classic snow-day criteria unless snow bands overperform locally."

The main watch-outs are residual impacts from Wednesday morning’s advisory snowfall (cleanup quality, untreated neighborhoods/side roads, refreeze) and localized blowing snow/visibility pockets later in the day.

    "decision_rationale": "PRE-DECISION CHECKLIST\n1) Agreement across experts: All four sources converge that new snow for Thu morning is light (~1\") and mainly pre-dawn (around 2–4 AM). Everyone flags that the bigger hazard is patchy slickness/refreeze rather than deep snow or a true whiteout. \n2) Disagreements/conflicts: News coverage emphasizes “dangerous wind chills/continued lake-effect,” which could imply higher disruption; Meteorology clarifies this isn’t contradictory—wind chills are harsh but the point forecast keeps meaningful snowfall out of the Thu morning commute (evening is more problematic). Safety/Historical upgrade the ICE/refreeze pathway versus the raw snow-total pathway.\n3) Plow timing math: Snow ends ~04:00–05:00; school start ~07:40 → ~2.7–3.7 hours. Safety analyst notes primaries often recover in ~1–2 hours post-snow; secondaries can take ~2–4 hours and remain variable at 07:40.\n4) Any ice? Yes, at least a meaningful refreeze/black-ice risk. Safety upgraded ice risk to HIGH due to falling temps and recent icing signals; meteorologist says freezing drizzle isn’t expected Thu AM, but residual moisture/slush can refreeze.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel check found NO confirmed Thu 1/22 closures/delays posted on Rockford, Sparta, Cedar Springs, Northview, or Greenville surfaced pages; no “3+ neighboring districts closed” trigger.\n6) What would make me wrong? (a) A lake-effect band shifts inland earlier than forecast and drops several inches near dawn, reducing the plow window effectiveness; (b) widespread black ice/glazing is reported on bus routes pre-6 AM; (c) an overnight crash spike/official road advisory emerges.\n\nWEIGHTED SYNTHESIS (per directive):\n- Meteorology (35%): points to light snow ending before commute; low snow-day signal.\n- Safety (25%): moderate morning commute impact; refreeze risk could justify a delay in rural pockets but not a strong closure case.\n- History (20%): similar setups skew OPEN or DELAY; closures uncommon (~5–10%) unless widespread glazing is confirmed.\n- News intel (20%): no confirmed neighboring closures; some recent severe icing chatter raises caution but not enough for a closure call without current/official confirmation.\n\nBottom line: With only ~1\" new snow and a workable plow window, a full snow day is unlikely; the main credible impact is patchy black ice on secondary roads and lots. I’m setting a 14% snow-day probability (closure), with the more likely operational outcome being “open” or a short delay if early-morning road checks look poor on rural routes.",
