However, at least one Weather.com hourly listing for Rockford, MI 49341 shows much colder conditions with 'Feels Like' values around -23°F to -24°F during the early morning hours—below the -20°F automatic-closure trigger. Because public Weather.com pages also show conflicting Rockford hour-by-hour outputs across different URLs, the web-source picture is inconsistent. With this level of disagreement, the safest operational stance is that the -20°F trigger cannot be ruled out based on public-facing app data, and a re-check using Weather.gov (NWS point forecast / hourly wind chill) and AccuWeather (RealFeel) is required as the decision window approaches.",

They also agree a delay is more plausible than a full closure.\n2) Disagreement: The only major conflict is wind chill—WeatherAPI bottoms near ~-7°F, but one Weather.com view suggests ≤-20°F. Web verifier re-check still shows inconsistent Weather.com variants and could not confirm NWS hourly in this environment, so this remains unresolved.\n3) Plow timing math: Precip ended Sun evening; there are ~12+ hours until ~6:30 AM. That is typically enough time for highways/arterials to become serviceable, but *also enough time for refreeze* to keep residential/secondary roads icy. Infrastructure monitor expects arterials mostly passable by 06:30–08:00 with localized black ice; residential streets most likely still icy.\n4) Ice?: Yes, moderate risk (refreeze/black ice) due to earlier light freezing rain/light snow and very cold temps. Not an active ice storm Monday.\n5) Neighboring districts: News intel found no verified closures/delays for Rockford, Forest Hills, Northview, Sparta, Lowell, Kentwood, or GRPS for 1/26—no upward adjustment.\n6) Power outages: Minimal currently (~68 systemwide in Consumers snapshot); no sign of a local outage-driven closure.\n7) Wind chill verification: Not confirmed by multiple reliable sources. One Weather.com page hits ≤-20°F, but other pages + WeatherAPI do not, and NWS couldn’t be checked here; therefore I cannot apply the near-automatic closure rule.\n8) What would make me wrong: (a) If NWS hourly/observations confirm wind chill ≤-20°F near 6–8 AM, closure probability jumps into the 90% range; (b) if widespread dense ice fog (≤0.25 mi) or widespread glare ice on neighborhood/bus-route roads is observed at 5:30–6:30 AM, many districts could call a 2-hr delay or even close.\n\nWeighting (per directive): Meteorology (25%) + Safety (20%) + History (15%) + News (15%) + Infrastructure (10%) + Power (10%) + Web verifier (5%). Base closure odds on a cold/dry day with residual slickness are low (history 7–15%). Safety suggests full closure ~10% and delay ~35%. Infrastructure supports “arterials ok / residential still icy,” consistent with delay-not-closure. News shows no closure signals. Power is not a driver.\n\nGiven all that, I set full snow-day (closure) probability at 14% (low, but not zero). Most disruption risk is better represented as a *2-hour delay* scenario rather than full closure. Confidence is moderate because the wind-chill and visibility signals are not authoritatively resolved here.",

Given the provided WeatherAPI hourly wind chills bottom out around roughly -7°F and winds are moderate, the base case is normal operations.

A full closure would require either (a) much more significant, widespread ice than implied by the very light wintry mix, or (b) an extreme wind-chill policy trigger being met region-wide. That second pathway is uncertain because one web verifier flagged a conflicting, much colder ‘feels like’ (-20s °F), but the provided WeatherAPI hourly wind chills are not close to that threshold.

With 0 new snow/ice expected and only moderate winds, the classic closure triggers (heavy snow during commute, ice storm, blizzard conditions) are absent. The two meteorology-driven risks are (1) very low visibility overnight into early morning (possible ice fog) and (2) cold wind chills—both of which can pressure a delay decision if they coincide with untreated roads and bus-route problem spots. On balance, that supports a low-but-nonzero snow-day probability, leaning toward delays rather than closure. I set 12% for full closure; I’d set a higher probability for a 1–2 hour delay if that were a separate question."

The main ways this becomes a snow day are (a) widespread glare ice from the prior evening that overwhelms overnight treatment, or (b) wind-chill policies being tripped by an *actual* sub -20°F wind chill forecast/observation. Given the provided WeatherAPI hourly wind chills bottom out around roughly -7°F and winds are moderate, the base case is normal operations. I assign ~10% to account for the ‘tail risk’ that residual ice + localized near-zero visibility (ice fog) is more widespread than modeled, prompting a closure rather than a delay."

The most plausible operational disruption is a **2-hour delay** if early-morning spot checks find widespread glare ice on neighborhood/bus-pickup roads or if dense ice fog materially reduces visibility during the bus window. A full closure would require either (a) much more significant, widespread ice than implied by the very light wintry mix, or (b) an extreme wind-chill policy trigger being met region-wide. That second pathway is uncertain because one web verifier flagged a conflicting, much colder ‘feels like’ (-20s °F), but the provided WeatherAPI hourly wind chills are not close to that threshold. Balancing these, I land at a low-to-low-moderate closure probability, with most of that probability mass actually representing “delay-worthy” morning hazards rather than a true snow day."

As of Sun 2026-01-25, Rockford Public Schools’ site shows no 1/26 closure/delay announcement, and I did not see neighboring-district closure signals either. Weather for Mon is cold but dry (no new accumulation), which typically does not generate same-day closures in West Michigan. The main realistic disruption would be a late decision for a **1–2 hour delay** if early-morning black ice/ice fog proves widespread on secondary roads. That keeps the full “snow day” probability low but non-zero."
