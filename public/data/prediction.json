Cross-checking web sources: Weather.com’s hourly page for Rockford shows Thu morning fog with ~35–36°F temps and “feels like” ~29–30°F (warmer than the API by ~4–6°F in the morning window). weatherUSA shows current conditions around low-40s with matching feels-like (useful for ‘now’ but not a detailed Thu-AM wind chill). No credible source located in this sweep shows any wind chill near -20°F for Thu morning; therefore, the automatic extreme-cold closure trigger is NOT supported. The more relevant operational risk from the API is freezing fog/low visibility and potential patchy slickness, not extreme cold or snow accumulation.",

The single meaningful school-impact hazard is freezing fog during the morning bus window: it can abruptly lower visibility and create thin, patchy glaze/black ice on untreated surfaces (especially bridges and rural connectors) despite minimal measurable precipitation. In Michigan—and specifically mid/late February in West Michigan—this pattern historically results in schools staying open most of the time, with delays occurring more often than full closures when fog becomes dense/widespread. News/community intelligence shows no closure domino effect and no active district messaging; infrastructure and power-grid inputs do not show system-wide failures, though live road-condition and outage detail is limited.

          "desc": "ESFGRR\n\nSteady melting of snow and ice over the last week has begun to cause\nrivers to rise across the area. Several chances for rain this week\nwill add to these rises. Based on current expected rainfall, no\nsignificant flooding is expected on West Michigan rivers, though\ntypical spring water level rises within the river channels will\nhappen.\n\nMeanwhile, river ice has weakened significantly over the last week,\nand as water levels rise any remaining ice will likely be broken and\nstart to move downstream. This creates the possibility for formation\nof a few ice jams. Ice jams tend to form in the same places\nrepeatedly, so special attention should be paid in the Comstock Park\n(Kent County) area as well as the Robinson Township (Ottawa County)\narea along the Grand River.\n\nAnyone living or working near West Michigan rivers should pay extra\nattention this week as water levels rise. Have a plan to monitor and\nrespond if flooding develops unexpectedly.\n\nMonitor the latest conditions at https://water.noaa.gov\n",
