Wind chills run about 8–10°F (not near the -10/-15/-20°F closure thresholds).\n\n2) Snow / ice timing: No precip shown overnight or during the morning commute. The only accumulating snow in this forecast occurs late evening (around 9–10 PM) with about 3.0 cm (~1.2\") total for the whole day. That’s minor and arrives well after school.\n\n3) Roads & plow math: With essentially 0\" during the overnight-to-7 AM window, road impacts at bus time should be minimal. Any snow that does fall is after dismissal, so plows aren’t stressed for the morning run.\n\n4) Wind/visibility: Winds increase during the day (gusts ~25–27 mph late afternoon/evening), but without morning snowfall this shouldn’t create hazardous blowing/drifting for buses. The dataset’s near-zero visibility entries occur in the evening; they don’t align with falling snow and may indicate fog/low cloud reporting—worth monitoring for after-school activities, not morning closure.\n\nMichigan-style bottom line: Expect OPEN. Snow-day probability is low (~5–10%). The only scenario that would raise risk is if an unmodeled band of lake-effect/snow showers develops pre-dawn (not indicated here)."

      "**Parking lots / drop-off lanes:** with temps near/just below freezing late day (~31–32°F) then dropping back below freezing in the evening, expect slick refreeze in lots and on sidewalks—have crews ready for salt and scraping before evening activities and again early Wednesday.",
      "**Operational guidance:** have transportation do an early route check of rural/gravel roads and low-traffic neighborhoods; if they report “polished” intersections or drifting (winds gusting ~25–27 mph late day), slow routes and adjust pickup timing rather than canceling.",

Snow in the WeatherAPI feed is light (~3.0 cm / ~1.2\") and appears mainly later (snow showers more likely in the evening per the hourly list), not during the morning commute.\n\nWhen I attempted to cross-check Weather.com, Weather Underground, WeatherBug, and The Weather Network, the pages returned by search results did not reliably display data for Tue 2026-02-24; several show other February date blocks (e.g., Feb 16–18) or appear cached/crawled content. Because of that, these web sources cannot be treated as a trustworthy confirmation of the specific Tue 2026-02-24 morning 'feels like' forecast. Within the (possibly wrong-date) web snippets I could retrieve, none showed anything near -20°F wind chill.\n\nGiven the inability to obtain a clean Weather.gov (NWS) or AccuWeather readout for the exact target date/time in this session, the only date-consistent dataset is your WeatherAPI feed.",

Safety’s ‘moderate’ ice risk is specifically from residual moisture/refreeze (isolated slick spots on bridges/overpasses, shaded areas, and neighborhood streets), not from new freezing precip—this typically leads to caution/route adjustments rather than a full closure in Michigan. News intelligence shows no emerging domino effect (no neighboring closures posted) and no official Rockford alert. Power grid conditions show no outage pattern that would force a closure.

I’d center the closure probability near the low end of the peers’ 5–10% range.\n\nI am *not* dropping it to near-zero because the region can get short-fuse lake-enhanced/mesoscale bands that overperform, and because the forecast’s condition text (‘moderate or heavy snow showers’) is qualitatively stronger than the small quantitative total—historically, that mismatch is exactly the kind of setup that can surprise if timing shifts earlier into pre-dawn.

The main safety concern is patchy refreeze/black ice on bridges, shaded areas, and low-traffic neighborhood streets—usually a ‘use caution / adjust routes’ scenario rather than a full cancel. I keep the probability above “near-zero” (8%) because West Michigan can see mesoscale/lake-enhanced bands shift earlier than modeled, and because the dataset shows odd near-zero visibility values in the early evening that could indicate fog/low stratus (or just data artifact); either could increase travel risk if it verified during school commute times (not currently forecast).",

The deciding factor for most districts—road conditions during the early-morning bus window—doesn’t have active snowfall in the forecast you provided. With only ~1.2\" total and the better forcing arriving after school, the base rate for a full closure is low.

I’d center the closure probability near the low end of the peers’ 5–10% range.\n\nI am *not* dropping it to near-zero because the region can get short-fuse lake-enhanced/mesoscale bands that overperform, and because the forecast’s condition text (‘moderate or heavy snow showers’) is qualitatively stronger than the small quantitative total—historically, that mismatch is exactly the kind of setup that can surprise if timing shifts earlier into pre-dawn.

That timing strongly reduces the chance of a *Tuesday* closure. The main safety concern is patchy refreeze/black ice on bridges, shaded areas, and low-traffic neighborhood streets—usually a ‘use caution / adjust routes’ scenario rather than a full cancel. I keep the probability above “near-zero” (8%) because West Michigan can see mesoscale/lake-enhanced bands shift earlier than modeled, and because the dataset shows odd near-zero visibility values in the early evening that could indicate fog/low stratus (or just data artifact); either could increase travel risk if it verified during school commute times (not currently forecast)."

Pair that with the forecast’s key detail—no snow during the 6–9 AM bus window on Tue Feb 24—and there’s little reason for administrators to pre-cancel.\n\nI’m not at 0% because West Michigan can still get a short-fuse lake-enhanced band or an overnight icing/black-ice problem that shows up on early route checks (5–6 AM) and forces a late decision. But absent an advisory/warning headline or a cluster of neighboring districts posting delays by very early morning, the most likely outcome is school OPEN."
