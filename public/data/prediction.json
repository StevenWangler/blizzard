Temperatures hover right around 30–32°F for an extended period with near-saturated air and light winds—classic setup for dense/freezing fog that can drop visibility to near-zero at times, especially 5–9 AM. Winds stay under ~10 mph, so blowing/drifting is not a factor. Wind chills during typical bus hours (6–8 AM) are roughly in the mid-20s°F (about 25°F), nowhere near Michigan cold-closure thresholds. With zero forecast snow/precip and modest winds, a full closure for Monday is unlikely in Michigan; however, a 2-hour delay is a realistic consideration if dense fog persists into the morning commute and visibility is consistently under ~0.25–0.5 mile on key bus routes. The decision will hinge on how widespread/long-lived the densest fog is by daybreak Monday and whether it produces patchy glaze on bridges, overpasses, and rural shaded roads."

Multiple independent, official Rockford Public Schools sources (district homepage reminders, district calendar, district news post, and superintendent update) confirm **no school on Monday 2/16/2026 due to Mid-Winter Break**, with early-childhood/preschool pages also showing closure. That makes the probability of a “snow day / no school” outcome extremely high regardless of weather. \n\nIf the question is narrowly “weather-triggered closure decision,” then the probability would be low (single digits) because the meteorological/safety/infrastructure inputs show **no snow accumulation**, light winds, and only a freezing-fog/patchy black-ice risk that more commonly supports a delay than a full closure in Michigan. But since the district is already scheduled closed district-wide, there is effectively no weather-driven go/no-go decision for regular classes on 2/16.\n\nUncertainty is mainly limited to edge cases (e.g., a separate community-ed/childcare program, athletics, or building activities making their own morning cancellation call), not whether regular school is in session.",

However, there is no forecast falling snow, no snow accumulation, and no strong wind component—so the typical drivers for a full Michigan snow day are absent.

Historically, that combination rarely yields a full closure in West Michigan absent a major crash cascade or an official ice event. \n\nHowever, the NEWS agent’s finding is decisive for the stated target: Monday, Feb 16, 2026 is already a scheduled no-school day (Mid-Winter Break). Interpreting the question literally (“snow day probability for Monday 2026-02-16”), the weather-driven closure probability is effectively 0 because school is not in session. I’m reporting 3% rather than 0% only as a hedge against mismatch (e.g., user is asking about a different district/building/program that does meet that Monday, or a different date) and because freezing-fog mornings can occasionally trigger a closure decision in districts that *are* in session.",

That can create two real school-impact pathways: (1) very low visibility during the 5–9 AM bus window and (2) patchy, hard-to-detect glaze/black ice from fog deposition/refreeze—especially on bridges and untreated neighborhood roads.\n\nHowever, the absence of any falling snow/freezing rain and the lack of strong wind make a *full closure* relatively unlikely in West Michigan. In similar setups, districts more often choose a 1–2 hour delay (to gain daylight and slight warming/mixing) than a complete shutdown. Netting these together, I’m slightly lower than my prior 12% because the primary hazard (fog) is conditional and often handled with delays/caution rather than closures, but I’m not at ~0% because near-zero visibility plus patchy glaze can occasionally force a closure if it is widespread and persists past decision time.\n\nImportant context from the NEWS agent: Rockford Public Schools reportedly have a scheduled no-school day (Mid-Winter Break) on Mon 2/16/2026. If that is correct and we are strictly forecasting *weather-caused* closure, the probability would be effectively ~0 for Rockford specifically because there’s no decision to close. My 8% should therefore be read as the meteorological probability of a weather-driven full closure **if school were otherwise in session** (or for nearby districts/programs that might still operate).",

However, the NEWS agent’s finding (scheduled Mid-Winter Break on Monday 2/16/2026) dominates the literal question: there’s likely no school regardless of weather.

The one legitimate school-impact signal is freezing fog: persistent saturation near 31°F can create (a) near-zero visibility around the 5–9 AM decision/commute window and (b) patchy black ice/glaze on bridges, overpasses, shaded/low-lying roads. That combination can trigger delays and, rarely, a closure if it’s widespread and crash-prone.\n\nHowever, I’m holding the *weather-driven closure* probability low because (1) the hazard is typically patchy/local rather than system-wide, and (2) districts can often mitigate with delay + spot treatment. I’m keeping a small non-zero number mainly as a hedge for the “fog verifies worse than modeled” scenario (widespread 0–0.25 mi visibility at bus time plus a crash cascade) and because the dataset shown is for 2/15 and we’re inferring persistence into 2/16.",

I’m holding at **6%** (slightly above meteorology/history’s 4%) because freezing fog can create high-consequence bus risk that sometimes prompts official messaging even on the margins—and because the web verification for date-matched forecasts/operations wasn’t perfect, leaving small residual uncertainty about the scenario framing.",

That combination more often supports a delay than a full closure.\n\nHowever, incorporating peer input, the NEWS agent’s evidence that Rockford Public Schools are scheduled closed on Monday, February 16, 2026 (Mid-Winter Break) is a decisive contextual override.

Here, that already-low closure likelihood is further suppressed because the district appears to have a scheduled closure (Mid-Winter Break) on 2/16/2026.

The only meaningful weather risk is freezing fog (near-saturated air with temps ~31°F) producing very low visibility around the early-morning window and potentially patchy black ice on bridges/overpasses and untreated secondary roads. That combination more often supports a delay than a full closure.\n\nHowever, incorporating peer input, the NEWS agent’s evidence that Rockford Public Schools are scheduled closed on Monday, February 16, 2026 (Mid-Winter Break) is a decisive contextual override. Interpreting the question strictly as the chance of a *weather-driven* snow day decision for that date, I keep the probability low and slightly above the prior 4% only as a hedge against scenario mis-specification (wrong district/Rockford, or non-calendar programming that still operates)."

In comparable past patterns (freezing fog near 32°F, no precip), closures are uncommon; the more typical administrative response is a 2-hour delay if visibility is near-zero at decision time and crash reports spike. Here, that already-low closure likelihood is further suppressed because the district appears to have a scheduled closure (Mid-Winter Break) on 2/16/2026. I set 5% to reflect residual uncertainty about (a) whether the ‘Rockford’ in question is exactly Rockford Public Schools, (b) whether the calendar scrape could be mismatched/stale, and (c) whether limited operations could still face a weather closure/cancellation decision that families might perceive as a ‘snow day.’"

The bigger contextual point is that Rockford Public Schools appear to be closed for Mid-Winter Break on Monday 2026-02-16 regardless of weather, so a *weather-triggered* snow day is unlikely. I keep a small 6% mainly for edge cases: (a) the user’s ‘snow day’ question is interpreted as “no school for any reason,” (b) district/date/location mismatch, or (c) limited special programs/activities that might still require a safety call."

Therefore the probability of “no school” is extremely high regardless of the freezing fog/black-ice risk.
