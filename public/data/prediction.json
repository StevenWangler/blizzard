That is uncomfortable but WELL ABOVE Michigan’s high-risk closure thresholds (-15°F to -20°F, and especially -20°F or colder). With zero snow/ice expected and no active advisories, roads should be in good shape and a snow day is very unlikely.

The web pulls returned Weather.com hourly pages, but the content shown was not clearly for 2026-02-23 (it displayed different date blocks/temperatures, suggesting the crawl snapshot or page localization wasn’t aligned to the target day). Additional non-primary sources (Weather-US.com, The Weather Network) also did not clearly provide a pinned-to-2026-02-23 6–8 AM 'feels like' for Rockford in the snippet.

The only credible pathway to disruption is a refreeze/black-ice morning on untreated bridges, shaded curves, and low-traffic neighborhood streets—consistent with minor incidents or, at most, a targeted delay if early-morning route scouting finds widespread glaze. Community/administrative signals also lean ‘open’: FOX17’s closings board shows no active closings/delays and there are no confirmed neighboring-district closures (reducing domino pressure). Power-grid conditions are not a driver; outage counts are very low statewide and trending down, with no evidence of a localized Rockford outage in the available data.

I’m raising that baseline slightly because the full-forecast context shows weekend freezing rain/light snow signals, so a refreeze could create scattered slick spots that sometimes prompt *delays* (more than full closures). Net: low single-digit chance of any cancellation, with most of that probability coming from an overnight glaze/black-ice surprise rather than Monday’s weather itself."

        "shiftReason": "From a safety standpoint, Monday (2026-02-23) looks like a “cold, dry, post-event” day rather than an active winter storm day. District-wide closures are typically driven by widespread impassability (new snow + poor visibility) or measurable ice/glaze. Here, the credible hazard is *patchy* black ice at daybreak from refreeze, which more often produces isolated crashes/delays than a full closure—especially in a winter-ready area like Rockford/Kent County. I’m keeping probability non-zero because a thin glaze on untreated back roads/bridge decks can create disproportionate bus-route risk even when forecasts show ‘0 precip,’ but the forecast as given strongly favors a normal school day (possibly with heightened early-morning road checks)."

The only plausible pathway to a snow day is if Saturday/Sunday’s mixed precip produces enough untreated ice that Monday morning road checks look worse than forecast—more consistent with a *delay* than a full closure. Given the provided Rockford-specific forecast of zero snowfall/precip on Monday and the lack of “domino” signals, I keep the snow-day probability low."
