In Michigan context, this is cold but not typically at the threshold where districts close purely for temperature; many districts look for sustained wind chills at or below about -15°F to -20°F during bus times, often coupled with other hazards. The more hazardous conditions (freezing rain, light snow, gusty winds) occur on Wednesday, and the Winter Weather Advisory is oriented toward lake‑effect belts west and southwest of Rockford, expiring by early Thursday morning. Historically in West Michigan, days that follow an advisory the previous evening—but are dry, with improving roads and \"just\" cold mid‑teens/20s temps—almost always see school remain open, perhaps with some localized slick spots but not system‑wide closures. Taken together, this pattern most closely matches a typical cold, post‑event January school day rather than a high‑probability snow‑day setup. Overall confidence is high that, based on historical decision patterns in this region, the probability of a snow day specifically for Thursday, 2026‑01‑15, is low."

    "decision_rationale": "1. EXPERT AGREEMENTS\n- Meteorology: Event for Rockford is essentially over by late Wednesday night. No additional snow is forecast overnight or during the morning commute; visibility is good; winds are modest; temps are in the teens/low 20s.\n- Safety: Worst conditions run from Wednesday afternoon into early Thursday (ending ~7:00 AM), with Thursday morning featuring cold, mostly dry roads and only isolated slick spots. Primary/secondary roads and parking lots all score 8/10 (good) and walking 7/10.\n- History: This pattern (post-advisory, dry, cold day with residual slickness) has historically led to very low closure rates (~5–10%) in the Rockford/West Michigan context. Rockford typically stays open for this level of cold and residual ice.\n- News/Intel: Rockford Public Schools show no indication of closure or delay. Neighboring districts likewise are not signaling widespread closures for Thursday, and regional outlooks do not single out Kent County/Rockford as a high-risk closure zone.\nAll four agree: Thursday looks like a typical cold, post-event winter school day, not an active storm or high-risk closure setup.\n\n2. EXPERT DISAGREEMENTS OR NUANCES\n- The safety analyst labels overall risk level as “moderate,” but when broken down, operational scores (7–8/10) and narrative support normal operations with caution, not closure.\n- News intel notes some higher closure risk in other regions (lakeshore, far SW Michigan) but explicitly does not place Rockford in the highest-risk band.\nThere are no major factual conflicts; any differences are a matter of wording, not substance.\n\n3. PLOW TIMING MATH (HOURS FROM SNOW/ICE END TO SCHOOL START)\n- Worst conditions end: 2026-01-15T07:00:00-05:00 per safety report, but meteorology notes that for Rockford, meaningful precip is essentially done by late evening/around midnight with no new accumulation afterward.\n- School start / bus window: roughly 6:00–8:00 AM, with first buses around 6:30–7:00 AM and high school start near 7:30–7:40 AM.\n- Practical interpretation: The impactful mixed precip and advisory conditions are on Wednesday. Rockford then has many overnight hours (late evening through pre-dawn) with no new accumulation. Crews can treat and clear roads before buses roll. By bus time, roads are mostly plowed and treated with only residual slick spots. This is classic “post-storm, improving” timing, strongly favoring school being open.\n\n4. ICE RISK\n- Ice formation risk is labeled “moderate” due to refreeze of Wednesday’s moisture with temps in the teens.\n- However: No fresh freezing rain or drizzle is forecast overnight, and skies are dry. With good plow/salt work, most main surfaces should be in decent shape. Remaining ice is patchy (bridges, side streets, shady spots, some sidewalks), not systemic glaze.\n- In Michigan context, this level of residual ice—without ongoing precip—is usually managed operationally (salting, careful driving) rather than by closing schools.\n\n5. NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS / DOMINO EFFECT\n- News intel clearly states: As of the evening of Jan 14, there are no confirmed closures for nearby districts (Forest Hills, Cedar Springs, Sparta, Lowell, Greenville, Kent ISD) for Thursday.\n- Some closures are possible in heavier lake-effect zones to the west/southwest, but immediate Rockford neighbors are not yet closing. There is no current domino effect in Kent County.\n- Per the competition rules: 3+ neighboring closures would justify adding 15–20% to the closure probability. That condition is not met.\n\n6. WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS PREDICTION WRONG?\nKey ways this forecast could bust upward:\n- A surprise, persistent lake-effect band drifts inland and sets up directly over Rockford pre-dawn, dropping several inches (4–6\") with low visibility and blowing snow during the commute.\n- More extensive black ice than expected—e.g., if earlier precip left a thin glaze on a large portion of side roads and parking lots, and road crews underperform or can’t complete treatment by morning.\n- An unexpected late-evening district decision driven by caution or staffing/transport issues, not strictly by the forecast.\nGiven current expert input, all of these are low-probability contingencies rather than the base case.\n\n7. WEIGHTING OF EXPERTS (PER DIRECTIVE)\n- Meteorology (35% weight): Strongly indicates no active storm at commute time, 0\" additional snow, good visibility, and only typical cold. This heavily pulls the probability down into the low range.\n- Safety (25% weight): Despite the label “moderate” risk, detailed scores (7–8/10) and narrative support normal operations with caution, not closure. This aligns with a low closure probability but not zero, acknowledging some residual slickness.\n- History (20% weight): Similar pattern days have only ~5–10% snow-day rates in this region; historical behavior supports a clearly low—though non-zero—chance.\n- News Intelligence (20% weight, secret weapon): No RPS closure signals, no neighbors closing, no strong community expectation of a snow day. Regional forecasters place the highest closure risk elsewhere. This strongly reinforces a low probability and argues against any upward adjustment.\nNet effect: All four pillars independently point to a low closure risk. There is no justification for boosting the probability into a moderate or high band.\n\n8. FINAL PROBABILITY DECISION\n- Base from meteorology + safety: ~10–15% (residual ice, cold, but no active storm).\n- Historical analogs nudge toward the lower side (5–10%).\n- News intel and lack of neighboring closures push away from any mid-range hedge.\nBalancing being decisive with Brier-score optimization, the final estimate is set at 10%—low but not zero, reflecting a small chance of an overnight surprise or administrative caution.\n\nConclusion: Conditions for Thursday, January 15, 2026, in Rockford, Michigan, overwhelmingly favor a normal school day with standard winter precautions, not a snow day.",
